[![Tests](https://github.com/tulipoaaaaa/codex_try/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tulipoaaaaa/codex_try/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Installation

Install the full development requirements and then any development extras:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

`requirements.txt` contains all runtime and development dependencies. For
minimal Docker or PyInstaller builds use `requirements.runtime.txt` instead,
which only includes the packages needed at runtime. The optional
`requirements-dev.txt` file adds linting and test tools.

## Environment configuration

See [docs/environment_config.md](docs/environment_config.md) for the list of
required environment variables and details on switching between test and
production modes.

## Testing

The test suite can run without PySide6 installed by setting the environment
variable `PYTEST_QT_STUBS=1`. This enables stubbed Qt classes so tests work in
headless or CI environments. Only limited behaviour is covered, so full UI
tests should still be executed locally with PySide6 available.

The test `tests/ui_wrappers/test_balancer_wrapper.py` relies on PySide6 (or the
`PYTEST_QT_STUBS` environment variable) and is marked with the
`optional_dependency` marker. Run only optional tests with:

```bash
pytest -m optional_dependency
```

Skip them using:

```bash
pytest -m "not optional_dependency"
```

## Pre-push hook

A convenience script is provided at `scripts/pre_push.sh` to run linting and the
unit tests before code is pushed. Install the hook by linking it into your local
Git hooks directory:

```bash
ln -s ../../scripts/pre_push.sh .git/hooks/pre-push
```

The script will run `ruff` if it is installed, or fall back to `flake8`. It then
executes `pytest`. The push will be blocked if any of these steps fail.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running GUI on Linux or headless environments

Install Qt system dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install libegl1 libxcb-icccm4 libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

Launch the application with offscreen rendering:

```bash
HEADLESS=1 python app/main.py
```
