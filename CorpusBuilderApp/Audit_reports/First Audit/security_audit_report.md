# Security Audit Report

## Date: [Current Date]

## Environment Context
- Special NVIDIA RTX environment with carefully crafted dependencies
- Custom PyTorch builds (torch, torchaudio, torchvision) for CUDA compatibility
- Environment modifications are restricted to prevent breaking NVIDIA functionality

## Vulnerability Findings

### Critical Dependencies (Cannot Be Modified)
The following dependencies are critical for NVIDIA RTX functionality and cannot be updated:
- torch (2.8.0.dev20250504+cu128)
- torchaudio (2.6.0.dev20250505+cu128)
- torchvision (0.22.0.dev20250505+cu128)

### Identified Vulnerabilities

#### 1. jinja2 (3.1.4)
Multiple vulnerabilities found:
- GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h (Fix: 3.1.5)
- GHSA-gmj6-6f8f-6699 (Fix: 3.1.5)
- GHSA-cpwx-vrp4-4pq7 (Fix: 3.1.6)

#### 2. setuptools (70.2.0)
- GHSA-5rjg-fvgr-3xxf (Fix: 78.1.1)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Cannot Mitigate)
- PyTorch-related packages cannot be audited or updated due to custom CUDA builds
- These are core dependencies for the NVIDIA RTX functionality

### Medium Risk (Documented)
- jinja2 vulnerabilities
- setuptools vulnerability

## Recommendations

1. **Documentation**
   - Keep this report updated with any new findings
   - Document any workarounds or mitigations implemented

2. **Monitoring**
   - Regularly run `pip-audit` to track new vulnerabilities
   - Monitor PyTorch security advisories for custom builds

3. **Containment**
   - Consider isolating the NVIDIA-specific environment
   - Use virtual environments for non-NVIDIA dependent code

4. **Future Planning**
   - Plan for eventual updates when compatible PyTorch versions become available
   - Consider creating a separate environment for non-NVIDIA dependent code

## Notes
- This environment is intentionally maintained with specific versions for NVIDIA RTX compatibility
- Updates to vulnerable packages are deferred to prevent breaking NVIDIA functionality
- Regular security audits will be performed to monitor for new vulnerabilities
