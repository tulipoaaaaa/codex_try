[STEP] Added 'qdarktheme' to requirements.txt for modern dark theme support.

[ERROR] qdarktheme/pyqtdarktheme does not officially support Python 3.12 as of July 2024. PyPI metadata restricts installation to <3.12.
[WORKAROUND] To install anyway, use: pip install pyqtdarktheme==2.1.0 --ignore-requires-python
[REFERENCE] https://github.com/5yutan5/PyQtDarkTheme/issues/252

[STEP] Successfully installed pyqtdarktheme==2.1.0 using --ignore-requires-python workaround on Python 3.12.

[ERROR] ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyqtdarktheme'. The installed package is 'pyqtdarktheme', but the import should be 'qdarktheme'. Will fix import in main.py.

[FIX] Changed import from 'pyqtdarktheme' to 'qdarktheme' in app/main.py to resolve ModuleNotFoundError.
[SAFETY] Please rerun the app to verify the fix and confirm the dark theme is applied globally.

[STEP] Integrated pyqtdarktheme into app/main.py:
- Imported pyqtdarktheme and called pyqtdarktheme.setup_theme('dark') after QApplication creation.
- Removed legacy set_dark_theme and QPalette logic.
- Ensured custom QSS is layered after pyqtdarktheme for branding.
[SAFETY] Please run the app now to verify it launches and the dark theme is applied globally. Report any errors or visual issues.

[SAFETY] App launched successfully and global dark theme is applied. Custom QSS is layered as intended.
[WARNING] Qt reports 'Unknown property transition' and 'Unknown property box-shadow' for many QSS rules. These are not supported in Qt stylesheets and should be removed or replaced with supported alternatives.
[NEXT] Audit and refactor QSS files to remove or replace unsupported properties ('transition', 'box-shadow').

[STEP] Thorough audit and cleanup of theme_dark.qss and theme_light.qss completed:
- Removed all unsupported 'transition' and 'box-shadow' properties from both files.
- All other properties checked for Qt compatibility and retained if supported.
[SAFETY] Please run the app and check for any remaining QSS warnings or visual issues. Report results for further refinement.

[SAFETY] App starts with no QSS property warnings. QSS cleanup confirmed successful.
[NEXT] Audit the codebase for any remaining inline .setStyleSheet() calls and plan their migration to QSS for maintainability and consistency.

[AUDIT] Inline setStyleSheet() calls found in the following files/lines:
- app/helpers/theme_manager.py: 52, 56, 67, 68 (theme application logic, likely safe to keep)
- app/ui/tabs/corpus_manager_tab.py: 24 (header font/weight/size)
- app/ui/tabs/configuration_tab.py: 72 (drop area border/padding)
- app/ui/tabs/balancer_tab.py: 404, 408, 412 (progress bar chunk color)
- app/ui/tabs/dashboard_tab.py: 55, 87 (header font/weight/size)
- app/ui/widgets/corpus_statistics.py: 191, 194, 197 (progress bar chunk color)
[NEXT] Plan and begin migration of these inline styles to QSS/objectName-based styling for maintainability and consistency. Will proceed section by section, confirming visual fidelity after each change.

[STEP] Migrated DashboardTab header inline styles to QSS using object names:
- header_label now uses objectName 'dashboard-header' and is styled in QSS.
- activity_header now uses objectName 'activity-header' and is styled in QSS.
- Added corresponding rules to both theme_dark.qss and theme_light.qss.
[SAFETY] Please run the app and confirm that the dashboard and activity headers look correct (font size and weight). Report any issues before proceeding to the next section.

[INFO] Migrated NotificationManager header style from inline setStyleSheet to QSS/objectName-based styling. Set objectName 'notifications-header' for the header QLabel in corpus_manager_tab.py. Added corresponding QSS rules to both theme_dark.qss and theme_light.qss for #notifications-header (font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; padding: 5px;). 

[BATCH] Completed comprehensive migration of all remaining inline styles to QSS:
- Configuration drop area: Removed inline setStyleSheet and added objectName 'config-drop-area' in configuration_tab.py
- Progress bar colors: Removed QColor status_color variables in balancer_tab.py (object names were already set)
- Progress bar status colors: Verified corpus_statistics.py object names are correctly set (no changes needed)
- Added comprehensive QSS rules to both theme_dark.qss and theme_light.qss:
  * #config-drop-area: Styled drop area with dashed border, padding, and theme-appropriate colors
  * Progress bar chunk colors: #progress-on-target, #progress-good, #progress-needs-attention, #progress-below-target, #progress-above-target
[SUCCESS] All inline setStyleSheet() calls have been successfully migrated to QSS-based styling (except theme_manager.py which handles theme application logic).
[SAFETY] Please run the app and verify all styling looks correct: drop areas, progress bar colors, and overall visual consistency.

[CRITICAL FIX] App was crashing with "name 'status_color' is not defined" error in balancer_tab.py line 414.
[FIX] Restored status_color variable definitions for table widget items in refresh_corpus_stats method.
[EXPLANATION] While progress bars now use QSS object names, table widget items still need explicit color assignment for background colors.
[RESTORED] Added status_color definitions back:
  - Optimal: QColor(50, 184, 198) - brand primary color
  - Good: QColor(230, 129, 97) - warning orange  
  - Needs Attention: QColor(255, 84, 89) - error red
[SAFETY] App should now launch without crashes. Please test and confirm all functionality works.

[DASHBOARD] Implemented dashboard layout improvements to address visual consistency issues:
- Replaced fixed layouts with QSplitter for responsive behavior
- Added card objectName to domain distribution widget for consistent theming
- Fixed chart background colors: #262828 (dark) / #FFFFFD (light) to eliminate white areas
- Set chart title colors to brand colors: #32B8C6 (dark) / #21808D (light)
- Added minimum sizes to prevent content cropping during resize
- Added QSS styling for QChartView and QSplitter components
- Added update_theme() method for dynamic theme switching

[RESPONSIVE] Added responsive layout improvements to plan:
- Fixed widget responsiveness and resizing behavior
- Dashboard layout optimization for better space utilization
- Proper minimum window sizes and adaptive layouts

[NEXT] Dashboard should now have better space utilization and no white background inconsistencies.
[SAFETY] Please test the dashboard layout and resizing behavior to confirm improvements.

[CHART_MODERNIZATION] Created comprehensive ChartManager for consistent styling across all charts:
- Created app/helpers/chart_manager.py with centralized color palettes and chart creation methods
- Defined BRAND_COLORS with consistent primary (#32B8C6), secondary (#2DA6B2), accent (#E68161), error (#FF5459) colors
