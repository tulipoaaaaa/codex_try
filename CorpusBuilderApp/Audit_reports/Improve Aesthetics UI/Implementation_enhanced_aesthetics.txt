üìä **PROGRESS OVERVIEW:**
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED (6/13 sections):** Global Theming, Widget Modernization, Chart Modernization, Component Improvements, Dashboard Layout, Analytics Redesign
- üîÑ **IN PROGRESS (2/13 sections):** Responsive Layout Improvements, Text Contrast Refinements
- ‚ùå **PENDING (5/13 sections):** Collectors Reorganization, Balancer Modernization, + others

**FOUNDATION COMPLETED:** ‚úÖ All core theming, styling, and chart systems are modernized and working
**CURRENT PHASE:** üéØ Refinement of implemented features based on user feedback

---

## üìã **USER FEEDBACK INTEGRATION (Latest)**

### Dashboard Issues to Address:
- **Poor space usage** - Content cramped at bottom, header positioning wrong
- **Pie chart styling** - Outline and pie pieces need white borders for better definition
- **Layout spacing** - Need better distribution of content across available space
- **Visual hierarchy** - Header placement and overall organization needs improvement
- **Concept is correct** - 4-column approach is right, execution needs refinement

### Analytics Issues to Address:
- **‚úÖ Clear win on 2x2 grid concept** - Removing tabs was successful
- **Text contrast problems** - Domain labels on pie chart need white/higher contrast text
- **Overlapping prevention** - Groups should not overlap on charts
- **Boring consistency** - While consistency is good, charts look too similar/boring
- **Color/chart variety needed** - Play with colors or different chart types while maintaining consistency
- **All charts need contrast improvements** - Apply same text visibility fixes across all charts

### Priority Refinements:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix dashboard space usage and layout positioning
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Improve chart text contrast (white text, no overlapping)
3. **SHORT-TERM**: Add visual variety to charts while maintaining consistency
4. **ONGOING**: Balancer and other pending sections

5. Code Patterns to Replace
---------------------------
| Pattern/Call to Replace                | Replace With / Refactor To                | Why                                      |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `set_dark_theme(app)` (QPalette logic) | Use `qdarktheme.setup_theme("dark")`      | Modern, consistent, less error-prone      |
| `.setStyleSheet(...)` in code          | QSS file rules, object names, or classes  | Centralized, maintainable, consistent     |
| Manual color logic for status/progress | QSS object names (e.g., "status-success") | Easier to update, matches theme           |
| Hardcoded margins/paddings             | QSS or layout defaults                    | Responsive, consistent spacing            |
| Chart color logic in each widget       | Central chart manager/util                | Consistent, easy to update                |

6. Testing & QA
----------------
- Test all screens after each major change for visual consistency.
- Check for regressions in widget appearance, especially for custom widgets and dialogs.
- Test on different screen sizes and DPI settings.
- Test both dark and light themes (if supported).

7. Summary of Required Changes
------------------------------
1. Add and initialize `qdarktheme` in your app entry point.
2. Remove legacy palette logic and inline styles.
3. Refactor all widgets to use object names and QSS for styling.
4. Centralize chart color and style logic.
5. Standardize layout spacing and padding via QSS.
6. Test and iterate for visual polish.

9. Dashboard Top Section Restructuring ‚úÖ COMPLETED - NEEDS REFINEMENT
-------------------------------------------------------
- **‚úÖ Implemented 4-column layout concept successfully**
  - *Achieved:* Created ActiveOperations and RecentActivity widgets, 4-column QSplitter layout
  - *Working:* Professional card styling, real-time updates, interactive elements

10. Collectors Tab Vertical Reorganization ‚ùå PENDING (HIGH PRIORITY)
----------------------------------------------------------
- **Convert horizontal collector tabs to vertical layout with integrated controls.**
  - *Current Issue:* Collectors spread horizontally across full width, inefficient space usage
  - *Target Design:* Vertical list of collectors with start/stop controls aligned to the right
  - *Implementation Steps:*
    1. Modify `app/ui/tabs/collectors_tab.py` to use QVBoxLayout for collector list
    2. Create collector item widgets with horizontal layout: [Collector Name/Info] [Start/Stop Controls]
    3. Style start/stop buttons to match current brand design (teal buttons)
    4. Maintain current "Collection Status" and "Stop All Collectors" sections at bottom
    5. Add proper spacing and card-style containers for each collector
  - *Benefits:* Better space utilization, cleaner visual hierarchy, easier to scan
  - *Files to Modify:* `collectors_tab.py`, add collector item widget class, update QSS styling

11. Balancer Top Section Modernization ‚ùå PENDING (HIGH PRIORITY)

    2. Improve domain allocation table presentation with better spacing and alignment
    3. Enhance chart area with consistent styling and proper proportions
    4. Keep existing "Balancing Options", "Control Panel", and "Balancing Status" sections unchanged
    5. Improve visual hierarchy with proper headers and section separation
  - *Preserve:* All existing functionality, options, and control mechanisms
  - *Files to Modify:* `balancer_tab.py`, potentially update QSS for table styling

- **üîß REFINEMENTS NEEDED based on user feedback:**
  - *Issue:* Domain distribution pie chart text needs white/better contrast
  - *Issue:* No overlapping of chart elements allowed
  - *Issue:* Charts are too consistent/boring despite being functional
  - *Fix Required:* Improve text contrast on all charts (white text for pie labels)
  - *Fix Required:* Prevent overlapping of chart elements
  - *Fix Required:* Add visual variety while maintaining consistency (colors, chart types)
  - *Enhancement:* Play with colors or different table types to make more interesting

13. Text Contrast and Readability Improvements ‚ùå PENDING
----------------------------------------------
- **Improve contrast ratios for all secondary/grey text elements.**
  - *Issue:* Grey text has insufficient contrast against dark backgrounds
  - *Implementation:*
    1. Audit all QSS color definitions for secondary text
    2. Update color values to meet WCAG AA contrast standards (4.5:1 minimum)
    3. Test readability across different screen types and lighting conditions
    4. Update both `theme_dark.qss` and `theme_light.qss`
  - *Target Elements:* Labels, descriptions, secondary information, placeholders
  - *Colors to Update:* #A7A9A9 (current grey) may need to be lighter in dark theme
