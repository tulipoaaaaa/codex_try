Looking at your Collectors page, I can see the same amateur design issues - basic layout, poor use of space, and unprofessional styling. You want all collectors displayed vertically with individual controls. Let me redesign this completely.
Current Collectors Page Issues:

Poor Layout Structure:

Collectors cramped in tabs instead of visible list
Wasted vertical space with mostly empty area
No proper card system or visual hierarchy


Basic Control Interface:

Simple start/stop buttons with no configuration options
No status indicators or progress visualization
Missing collector details and settings


No Information Architecture:

Can't see all collectors at once
No collector status overview
Missing configuration management
No performance metrics or logs


Exact Changes Required for Collectors Transformation:
1. Layout Structure Complete Overhaul
Current Problem: Collectors hidden in tabs, wasted space, basic controls
Solution:

Vertical Card Grid: grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(450px, 1fr))
Responsive Layout: Cards automatically adjust to screen size
Full Visibility: All 10 collectors displayed simultaneously
Professional Cards: Each collector gets dedicated space with proper padding and styling

2. Individual Collector Controls
Current Problem: Only basic start/stop for one collector at a time
Solution:

Three-Button System: Start/Stop, Configure, Logs for each collector
Color-Coded Actions: Green (start), Red (stop), Orange (configure), Gray (logs)
Status-Aware Buttons: Button text changes based on collector state
Individual Progress: Each collector shows its own progress bar and metrics

3. Rich Information Display
Current Problem: No collector details or status information
Solution:

Collector Profiles: Name, description, purpose, and data source tags
Real-Time Metrics: Document count, file size, runtime duration
Progress Visualization: Live progress bars for active collections
Status Indicators: Color-coded dots (green=running, red=error, gray=stopped)
Live Logs: Real-time activity logs with timestamp and status

4. Global Control Bar
Current Problem: No system-wide management
Solution:

Master Controls: Start All Active, Stop All Collectors
System Actions: Refresh Status, Global Settings
Status Summary: Live count of running/stopped/error collectors
Professional Styling: Gradient buttons with hover effects and icons

5. Enhanced Visual System
Current Problem: Amateur styling, no visual hierarchy
Solution:

Card States: Different border colors for running (teal), stopped (gray), error (red)
Professional Typography: Proper font hierarchy and spacing
Status Animations: Pulsing indicators for active collectors
Hover Effects: Cards lift and enhance on hover
Icon System: Relevant icons for each collector type

6. Complete Collector Coverage
Included All Collectors from Your Interface:

ISDA: Derivatives documentation (running)
GitHub: Code repositories (stopped)
arXiv: Academic papers (running)
FRED: Economic data (stopped)
BitMEX: Crypto trading docs (error state)
Quantopian: Trading algorithms (stopped)
SSRN: Research papers (running)
Web: Custom web scraping (stopped)
Anna's Archive: Academic books (stopped)

7. Professional Features Added
New Capabilities:

Configuration Management: Each collector can be individually configured
Log Monitoring: Real-time activity and error logs
Progress Tracking: Visual progress bars with percentages
Error Handling: Clear error states with retry functionality
Resource Monitoring: File counts, sizes, and runtime tracking

8. Responsive Design System
Mobile/Tablet Support:

Adaptive Grid: Cards resize based on screen size
Stacked Layout: Single column on mobile devices
Touch-Friendly: Proper button sizing for mobile interaction
Preserved Functionality: All features work across devices

This redesign transforms your collectors page from a basic tab interface to a professional enterprise-grade management dashboard. Each collector is now independently controllable with full visibility into status, progress, and logs - exactly what you requested for comprehensive collector management.
