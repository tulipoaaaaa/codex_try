Looking at your dashboard, I can see the same amateur design issues we had with analytics. The layout is cramped, typography is inconsistent, and there's no professional visual hierarchy. Let me break down the problems and provide a complete redesign.

## Current Dashboard Issues:

1. **Poor Layout Structure:**
   - Cramped spacing with no breathing room
   - No proper grid system or visual hierarchy
   - Elements scattered without clear organization

2. **Statistics Section Problems:**
   - Poor typography and alignment
   - All 0% values look broken/incomplete
   - Domain distribution list is poorly styled
   - No visual cards or proper containers

3. **Chart Area Issues:**
   - Awkward chart positioning and sizing
   - Amateur control buttons (Refresh, Balance Corpus)
   - Poor legend styling and positioning
   - No proper chart container styling

4. **Operations & Activity Sections:**
   - Basic progress bars look unprofessional
   - Poor spacing and typography
   - Unclear status indicators
   - No proper list styling or time formatting

## Professional Dashboard Redesign:## Exact Changes Required for Dashboard Transformation:
