Dynamic  Hedging  is the  definitive  source 
on  derivatives  risk.  It provides  a  real- 
world  methodology  for  managing  port- 
folios  containing  any  nonlinear  security. 
It presents  risks  from  the  vantage  point 
of the  option  market  maker  and  arbitrage 
operator.  The  only book  about  derivatives 
risk  written  by an  experienced  trader 
with  theoretical  training,  it remolds 
option  theory  to  fit  the  practitioner’s 
environment.  As a  larger  share  of market 
exposure  cannot  be properly  captured  by 
mathematical  models,  noted  option  arbi- 
trageur  Nassim  Taleb  uniquely  covers 
both  on-model  and  off-model  derivatives 
risks, 

The  author  discusses,  in  plain  English, 
vital  issues,  including: 

~  The  generalized  option,  which  encom- 
passes  all  instruments  with  convex 
payoff,  including  a  trader’s  potential 
bonus 

-  The  techniques  for  trading  exotic 
options,  including  binary,  barrier, 
multiasset,  and  Asian  options,  as  well 
as  methods  to  take  into  account  the 
wrinkles  of  actual,  non-bellshaped 
distributions 

~  Market  dynamics  viewed  from  the 
practitioner's  vantage  point,  including 
liquidity  holes,  portfolio  insurance, 
squeezes,  fat  tails,  volatility  surface, 
GARCH,  curve  evolution,  static  option 
replication,  correlation  instability, 
Pareto-Levy,  regime  shifts,  autocorre- 
lation  of  price  changes,  and  the 
severe  flaws  in  the  value  at  risk 
method 

New  tools  to  detect  risks,  such  as 
higher  moment  analysis,  topography 
exposure,  and  nonparametric  tech- 
niques

“Dynamic  Hedging  deals  with  issues  in risk  management  and  valuation  from 
an  intuitive  perspective  that  only  a  pioneering  practitioner  and  researcher 
like  Taleb  can  provide.  Taleb  has  done  a masterful  job of addressing  the  fun- 
damental  risk  management  dilemma  of reconciling  differences  in  the  real- 
world  price  behavior  with  that  expected  by  theoretical  modeling.  He 
combines  anecdote  with  rational,  brilliant  insight  to  present  a  powerful 
treatise  on  derivatives  risk.”

Preface 

After  closing  about  200,000  option  transactions!  (that  is  separate  option 
tickets)  over  12 years  and  studying  about  70,000  risk  management  reports,  I 
felt  that  I needed  to  sit  down  and  reflect  on  the  thousands  of mishedges  I 
had  committed. 

I clambered  up  to  my  attic  where,  during  6 entire  months,  I spent  14 
hours  a  day,  7  days  a  week,  immersed  in  probability  theory,  numerical 
analysis,  and  mathematical  statistics  (at  a  Ph.D.  level).  Then  I began  to 
write  this  book. 

Like  George  Soros’,  I believed  in  a  greater  uncertainty  principle  (more 
acute  than  Heisenberg’s)  that  largely  invalidates  social  science  theories 
based  on  physics-like  methodology  and  weakens  the  notion  of  modeling 
outside  of  the  natural  sciences.  It ain't  physics,  | kept  warning  my  trainees 
throughout  my  career. 

My  other  argument  against  being  scientific  was  that,  even  if it were  a 
“science,”  option  theory  (while  perhaps  on  the  right  track)  would  be  too 
young  to  be  reliable.  I then  needed  to  warn  the  public  (and  the  regulators) 
against  taking  an  unseasoned  and  new  field  and  applying  some  of its  still 
misspecified  models  to  reality.  Many  of  the  market  risks  that  have  been 
well  known  to  traders  since  imperial  Rome  (like  squeezes  and  the  snow- 
balling  liquidity  holes)  have  not  yet been  rediscovered  by the  scientific  risk 
managers.  I am  convinced  that  the  financial  system  is  largely  threatened 
by the  proliferation  of  risk  management  advisory  services  run  by former 
scientists  who  bullied  their  way  into  financial  markets.  My intention  was  to 
downgrade  hedging  and  risk  management  from  the  status  of science  to  that 
of a  craft,  until  further  notice. 

This  book  is about  hedging  the  risks  of standard  and  exotic  options,  as 
part  of  the  larger  framework  of  risk  management.  No  road  map  was  avail- 
able  since  little  has  been  written  on  this  subject  (in contrast  to  the  extensive 
literature  for  valuation). 

Dynamic  hedging  is  more  like  medicine  than  biology.  It  is  learned  by 
gaining  practical  experience  as  well  as  by studying  published  research.  The 
wrinkles  of the  marketplace  often  dominate  other  complex  issues,  which  can 
lead  option  theoreticians  onto  a  wrong  path.  Traders’  lore  can  only be  trans- 
mitted  through  practice.  This  book  will  meld  matters  of practical  (not  neces- 
sarily  anecdotal)  importance  with  fundamental  theory. 

The  major  theme  is to  present  traders  and  risk  managers  with  the  tools 
to navigate  around  the  difficult  notion  of manufacturing  financial  products 

vi 

Preface 

through  book-running.  This  book  will  introduce  the  arcane  world  of  dy- 
namic  monitoring  of risks.  The  core  of dynamic  hedging  includes: 

°  The  need  for  a  methodology  for  the  implementation  of  the  Black- 
Scholes-Merton’  replicating  process  for  options  or  any  other  nonlin- 
ear  security  under  the  constraints  imposed  by the  marketplace. 
e  The  need  to  generalize  the  Black-Scholes-Merton  framework  to  cover 
other  parameters  than  the  underlying  security  in the  replicating  pro- 
cess  (like  volatility  or  interest  rates). 

e  The  awareness  that  transaction  costs  and  frequency  can  cause  a  de- 

parture  from  the  canons  of continuous  time  finance. 

e  The  awareness  that  distributions  are  unstable  and  hard  to  model. 

Much  of the  common  option  literature  has  been  concerned  with  details 
of  the  pricing  of  instruments  (some  of  which  remain  untractable).*  These 
works  often  provide  insignificant  answers  to  insignificant  problems,  such 
as  the  search  for  precision  in the  pricing  of American  options  with  constant 
volatility  or  interest  rates  (penny  wisdom  and  dollar  insensitivity).  In addi- 
tion,  the  nontheoretical  option  literature,  departing  fromsthe  Black-Scholes- 
Merton  framework,  has  been  ensconced  in  static  risk  measurement.  Most 
documents  introducing  traders  to  conventional  risks  show  only  the  static, 
not  the  dynamic,  risks.  A  derivatives  position  that  is  dynamically  hedged 
will  be  subjected  to  an  entirely  different  risk  profile  and,  given  the  limita- 
tions  of such  hedging,  will  therefore  be subjected  to path  dependence  (a key 
word  for  an  option  manufacturer). 

Readers  will  not  find  a  magazine-type  proliferation  of  traded  exotic 
structures  that  delineate  infinite  variations  and  combinations;  instead,  the 
analysis  is  limited  to  the  nondecomposable  structures  (the  SDF,  smallest 
decomposable  fragment).  A  structure  that  is  the  addition  of  two  products 
will  be  therefore  excluded  (except  in  few  cases  of  nonadditivity,  where  the 
combination  has  some  merit  for  the  dynamic  hedger).  The  objective  of this 
book  is  to  provide  the  traders  and  risk  managers  with  the  tools,  not  the 
ramifications. 

Readers  should  use  this  book  like  a  roadmap,  searching  out  topics  that 
interest  them  and  moving  freely  from  topic  to  topic.  The  formal  definitions 
serve  as  anchors  between  categories. 

More  advanced  mathematical  topics  are  relegated  to  the  modules  at 
the  back  of  the  book.  An  attempt  has  been  made  to  avoid  mathematical 
language  and  to  explain  issues  in  plain  English.  Formulas  do  not  appear 
until  Chapter  22.  In  addition,  in  the  presentation  of  mathematical  ele- 
ments,  the  book  avoids  the  measure-theoretic  framework  (required  for 
most  proofs  in  probability  theory)  and  follows  an  intuitive  path.  Most 

Preface 

vii 

mathematical  concepts  surrounding  the  topic can  be explained  with  an  in- 
tuitive  verbal  description  accompanied  by graphical  hints. 

Option  Wizards  provide  a  lighter  note  for  many  serious  topics.  Since 
these  sections  are  designed  to  be  read  independently,  readers  can  flip  be- 
tween  them  at  their  discretion. 

Finally,  throughout  this  book,  the  pronoun  he is used  as a stylistic  con- 
vention  for  ease  of reading.  This  use  should  always  be  construed  as  gender 
neutral. 

e  Part  I (Chapters  1-6)  defines  market  microstructure  and  products. 
The  markets  are  viewed  from  the  vantage  point  of  broker  speaker 
boxes  and  market  pits,  but  also  are  defined  in  the  formal  setting  of 
market  microstructure  theory. 

¢  Part  II  (Chapters  7-16)  defines  the  basics  of vanilla  option  risk  and 

presents  measurement  tools. 

¢  Part  III  (Chapters  17-23)  describes  the  risks  of exotic  options. 

¢  Part  IV  (Modules  A  to  G) presents  more  quantitative  tools  of analy- 
sis  and  bridges  a  practitioner’s  world  with  option  theory.  These 
modules,  however,  should  not  be  construed  as  appendixes:  Most  of 
their  content  belong  to  the  core  of the  text. 

NOTES  ON  THE  TEXT 

Given  that  I did  not  initially  learn  about  options  in  the  literature  but  di- 
rectly  from  the  market  (through  observation  and  experimentation),  most  of 
my  reasoning  remains  highly  intuitive.  I apologize  to  people  with  more 
scholastic  tastes  who  may  not  be  used  to  such  a  presentation.  Most  exam- 
ples  in  this  book  are  presented  as  generic  situations.  The  volatility  will  be 
defined  as  15.7%  (to make  one  standard  deviation  equal  to  1%  daily  move). 
The  markets  will  be scaled  to  trade  at  100.°  For  the  purposes  of pure  option 
situations,  the  forward  is equal  to  spot,  and  the  financial  carry  is insignifi- 
cant  (except  in the  rare  difficult  cases  where  it matters).  All  options  will  be 
European  style  except  for  the  exotic  options  where  a  term  structure  may 
be introduced  if it becomes  relevant  for  the  exercise. 

Showing  the  profile  of  a  butterfly,  for  example,  will  involve  using 
98/100/102  generic  calls  and  studying  a  calendar  spread  looking  at  the 
three-month  100  against  the  6-month  100  calls,  and  so  on. 

The  creation  of  generic  examples  will  standardize  all  cases  and  help 
in  equating  situations  throughout  the  book.  When  dealing  with  a  purely 
conceptual  option  problem,  it is necessary  to  strip  out  the  underlying  par- 
ticularities.  Optionality  transcends  the  details  in  most  cases.  Where  these 

viii

particularities  are  essential,  we  will  revert  to  a  singular  example  taken  from 
a  specific  market.

Jargon 

Many  terms  may  be  linguistically  ambiguous  for  people  from  outside  the 
industry.  Even  option  books  written  for  practitioners  do  not  seem  to  pick 
up  our  vernacular. 

The  same  designation  delta  is used  for both  the  rate  and  the  total  equiv- 
alent  exposure  (rate  times  face  value).  The  same  for  gamma,  vega,  theta,  and 
other  Greeks. 

By “volatility”  is always  meant  implied  volatility,  not  historical.  By “15 
volatility”  read  15%  implied  volatility  for  the  instrument  in  annualized 
terms. 

By “underlying”  is  meant  underlying  asset,  which  is  also  called  spot, 

cash  price  (as opposed  to  forward  or  future). 

Preface 

ix 

By “50  cents  price”  for an  option  is always  meant  .5%  of face  value.  By “1 

dollar”  is meant  1%.  By “tick”  or  “pip”  is meant  .01%  of face  value. 

By “long  the  100”  read  long the  100  strike. 
By “shorter”  and  “longer”  option  read  “option  with  shorter  time  to  ex- 

piration.” 

By “leg”  is meant  one  side  of a  trade  in a  strategy. 
By  “Black-Scholes-Merton”  is  meant  the  Black-Scholes-Merton  option 

valuation  model,  as  well  as  its  extensions  to  more  complex  securities. 

By  “stopping  time”  or  “first  exit”  read  expected  stopping  time  or  ex- 

pected  first  exit  time. 

By “high  correlation  matrix”  read  a  correlation  matrix  with  most  para- 

meters  close  to  1. 

By “integral”  is often  meant  stochastic  integral.  By “sensitivity  to  a  para- 
meter”  is meant  comparative  static  sensitivity  to a  parameter  change.  By “the 
delta  vanishes  asymptotically”  is  meant  that  the  delta  vanishes  asymptoti- 
cally to the  asset  price. 

By x/2  y is meant  (x/2)  y and  a  +  b/2  means  a  +  (b/2). 
Finally,  the  term  derivative,  can  mean  either  a  derivative  security  or  the 
mathematical  rate  of  change.  When  possible,  the  text  will  specify  if it  is  a 
mathematical  derivative;  otherwise  it should  be construed  as  being a security.

Acknowledgments 

This  work  reflects  the  help  and  knowledge  of many.  First,  I want  to  thank 
two  people  who  participated  in  every  phase  of  the  manuscript’s  develop- 
ment:  Raphael  Douady,  a  mathematician  and  Howard  Savery,  an  exotic  op- 
tions  trader.  Both  have  extremely  intuitive  and  fast  minds.  They  asked  me 
to  adopt  a  language  that  would  be  neutral  enough  for  both  to  understand. 
Many  of the  ideas  of the  book  were  discussed  and  belabored  to  the  point  of 
my  being  incapable  of  distinguishing  between  my  original  ideas  and  the 
ones  that  they  suggested  to  me.  Raphael,  in  addition,  composed  an  aca- 
demic  paper  on  stopping  time  (in  French  no  less)  to  help  with  some  of  the 
pricing  tools  for  the  book. 

The  pedagogical  method  of  defining  the  issue  and  explaining  it  intu- 
itively  prior  to  expanding  any  point  was  inspired  by the eoaching  of Marty 
O’Connell  and  Jim Piper  with  whom  I, along  with  Richard  Laden,  gave  a se- 
ries  of seminars  on  simple  methods  for  hedging  complicated  options.

Dynamic  Hedging 

ve 

As  these  events  are  beyond  our  understanding  let  us fake being  their  instigator. 

Jean  Cocteau 

PRINCIPLES  OF  REAL  WORLD  DYyNAmic  HEDGING 

M@  Rebalancing  the  gamma  corresponds  to  buying  and  selling  the  underly- 

ing security  in order  to  replicate  the  payoff  of the  option. 

| 

Even  if traders  knew  the  exact  future  volatility  but  hedged  themselves  (re- 
balanced  the  gamma)  at discretely  spaced  increments,  they would  still  have 
difficulty  predicting  the  final  P/L.  Option  pricing  eliminated,  by necessity, 
the  transaction  costs.  If however,  they  traded  every  millionth  of a  second  at 
the  screen  mid-market  they  would  get a  P/L  with  certainty. 

Increasing  the  frequency  of adjustments  would  compress  the  results  as 

shown  in the  following  chart: 

Probability 
density 

Replicating  price 

Mathematically,  the  shape  of the  distribution  is  simply  determined  by 
o/Vn  (functional  central  limit  theorem).  An  intuitive  explanation  is  that 
an  average  will  tend  to  the  mean  at a  speed  of 1/Vnumber  of draws.  In this 
case,  the  mean  is the  Black-Scholes-Merton  value  of the  security.  In  Chap- 
ter  16,  a  case  study  shows  the  magnitude  of  the  adjustment  luck  in  the 
tracking  of the  P/L. 

2  Introduction 

The  increase  in  transaction  frequency  would  have  the  effect  of increas- 
ing the  dynamic  hedging  costs  (owing  to  transaction  costs)  by moving  the 
center  of the  distribution  to  the  left,!as  seen  in the  following  chart: 

Market  makers  hence  face  the  continuous  dilemma  between: 

e  Variance  of returns  on  one  hand.  (Option  replication  is not  a risk-free 

proposition.) 

e  Transaction  costs  on  the  other. 

en  an  option  trader  sells  a  structure  that  is worth  5.00  on  his  theo- 
refical  value  sheets,  he  can  expect,  baring  transaction  costs,  to  manufacture 
it  for  somewhere  between  4.00  and  6.00.  However,  the  more  parameters  he 
needs  to be protected  against,  the  higher  the  management  costs. 

Ce Management  Rule: 

The  more  volatile  parameters  the  option 
rader  needs  to  be  protected  against,  the  more  allowance  is neces- 
sary  against  both  the  volatility  of the  parameters  and  the  expected 
transaction  costs. 

The  thesis  of this  book  is that  the  more  parameters  fly around  (interest 
rates,  volatility  term  structures,  etc),  the  more  arduous  the  dynamic  hedg- 
ing.  Unlike  the  Black-Scholes-Merton  world  our  trading  environment  re- 
quires  us  to  hedge  more  than  the  gamma.  Every  possible  second  derivative 
will  be costly.  We  must  hedge  the  vega  convexity,  the  exposures  to  the  rates 
and  so  on  as  they  are  not  stable.  Chapter  15  shows  the  effect  of  stochastic 
volatility  and  provides  the  intuition  for  the  vega  convexity.  Chapter  10  in- 
cludes  a  description  of convexity  broadly  defined. 

As  Black-Scholes-Merton  includes  the  cost  of gamma  in  computing  the 
time  value  of  the  option,  so  will  we  need  to  add  the  convexity  of  all 
non  linear  parameters  to  it (an  Ito  term,  see  Module  G).  A position  that  is 
short  gamma  on  interest  rates  in  addition  to  the  Black-Scholes-Merton 
gamma  needs  to  be priced  accordingly,  with  the  proper  markup  (or down). 
The  Option  Wizard,  The  Contamination  (or  Convexity)  Principle,  provides  an 

Dynamic  Hedging

intuitive  explanation  of the  issue.  Problems  will  occur  where  the  moves  in 
the  parameters  might  be correlated. 

(tions  that  require  vega  neutrality  in  a  concave  vega  (short  volatility 
atility)  will  then  be inferior  in value  to  others  that  do  not  require  such 

ynamic  hedge  owing  to  linear  vega  and  so  on. 

The  need  to  understand  the  replicating  process  more  thoroughly  with 

exotic  options  reflects  their  greater  hedging  costs. 

GENERAL  Risk  MANAGEMENT 

In  the  immature  modern  financial  jargon,  risk  management  is usually  inter- 
preted  as  either  coping  with  the  financial  risks  inherent  to  an  otherwise 
nonfinancial  businesses  or  the  market  risks  incurred  by providers  of finan- 
cial  instruments  (such  as  trading  firms,  exchange  traders,  banks,  and  other 
dealers).  The  latter  will  be  the  concern  of this  book.  Books  on  risk  manage- 
ment  abound  by people  who  try  to  explain  sophisticated  financial  tools  to 
treasurers  of  corporations  or  pension  funds  managers.  Because  providers 
face  daily  risks  in  the  manufacturing  of the  financial  products  and  instru- 
ments,  this  book  focuses  on  the  risk  transfer  between  a static  product  (cor- 
porate  risk)  and  a  dynamic  one  (the  market  maker’s),  the  delta-neutral 
operator  in Black-Scholes-Merton’s  world. 

There  are  two  levels  of risk  management:  micromanagement  and  macro- 

management. 

Micromanagement  occurs  at  the  level  of one  product  line  or  one  coher- 
ent  book  run  by a  unit  (e.g.,  exchange  local  or  “upstairs”  trading  desk). 
This  encompasses  the  intimate  knowledge  of the  behavior  of every  de- 
rivative  product  with  respect  to  time  and  market  movement  and  the 
thorough  thinking  in  multiple  dimensions  required  by the  derivatives 
trader’s  function  (the  fruit  of lengthy  apprenticeship). 

Macromanagement  takes  place  at  the  level  of  a  general  firm.  This  is  a 
generally  more  quantitative,  more  theoretical  function  perfected  by a 
general  watchdog.  Somehow  by magic,  the  sum  of the  risks  does  not  add 
up  to  the  total  risks.  Some  books  match  one  another,  while  the  risks  of 
others  become  additive.  However,  the  measurement  tools,  like  diversifi- 
cation  and  correlation,  so  celebrated  in  modern  finance  appear  to  be 
still  imprecise  and  of  weak  predictive  powers.  Their  use  can  danger- 
ously  lull  the  risk  managers  into  a  false  sense  of statistical  security. 

The  macromanager’s  function  is to  allocate  risk  (defined  as  total  possi- 
ble  variance)  across  products  and  units  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  a 
trading  firm’s  most  valuable  resource:  risk.  Figure  I.1  illustrates  the  rela- 
tionship  of dynamic  hedging  to  risk  management.

The  larger  risk  management  framework. 

There  has  been  a  growth  in the  number  of “risk  management  advisors,” 
an  industry  sometimes  populated  by people  with  an  amateurish  knowledge 
of  risk.  Using  some  form  of  shallow  technical  skills,  these  advisors  emit 
pronouncements  on  such  matters  as  “risk  management”  without  a  true  un- 
derstanding  of  the  distribution.  Such  inexperience  and  weakness  become 
most  apparent  with  the  value-at-risk  fad  or  the  outpouring  of books  on  risk 
management  by authors  who  never  traded  a  contract. 

There  is  no  shortcut  method  of  risk  management.  Every  person  who 
needs  to  be  acquainted  with  the  activity  should  work  hard  at  trying  to 
make  sense  of the  dynamic  interaction  of portfolio  components  relative  to 
time  and  combinations  of  market  movements.  Every  derivative  user  or 
trader  needs  to  be  able  to  account  for  the  effect  of  either  the  passage  of 
time  or  the  movement  of  the  underlying  assets  on  the  portfolio.  Issues 
of pricing  are  therefore  overstated:  Most  money  is made  or  lost  because  of

not because of mispricing. 
market movement, 
ing.  Most  commonly,  losses  result  from  a  poor  understanding  of liquidity 
and  the  shape  of the  statistical  distribution.

Option  Wizard:  Culture  Shocks 

There  are  spectacular  communication  problems  between  traders  and  quants 
(research  assistants)  owing  to  many  factors: 

¢  People  who  have  completed  a  Ph.D.  program  develop  a  tendency  to  be 

thorough. 

¢  Traders,  by  contrast,  are  impatient  and  need  brief  simplistic  descriptions, 
something  someone  who  spent  most  of  his  adult  life  solving  complex  prob- 
lems  is  often  unable  to  provide.  Traders  tend  to  see  matters  in  “flashes,”  a 
type  of nonlinear  epistemology.  Such  desire  for  the  highest  level  of possible 
abstraction  is sometimes  mistaken  for  “short  attention  span.” 

This  leads  to  Brecht-like  amusing  exercises  in  incommunicability  between 
traders  and  their  quants.  One  trader  (himself  a  former  quant)  built  the  following 
strategy  in  dealing  with  the  research  department  people.  When  communicat- 
ing with  him,  they  were  advised  to  do  the  following: 

1.  In  a  single  sentence,  explain  the  conclusion,  before  discussing  the  subject 

matter. 

2.  In  a  single  sentence,  explain  the  subject  matter. 

3.  If unable  to  perform  1 or  2, then  abandon  the  entire  project. 

This  method  helps  the  quant  understand  the  major  difference  between  the 
less  challenging  matters  of the  real  world  and  the  thrills  of science.  In  addition, 
it provides  him  with  a  way  to  learn  to  focus  like  a  businessperson. 

Richard  Feynman,*  one  of  the  greatest  minds  of  our  times,  was  comfort- 
able  enough  with  his  subject  matter  to  write  an  intuitive  book  on  quantum 
physics  without  a  single  formula.

Introduction  to  the  Instruments 

Understanding  a  theory  means  (...)  understanding  it as  an  attempt  to  solve  a 
certain  problem. 

Sir  Karl  Popper 

In  this  chapter,  we  will  rapidly  but  formally  define  the  instruments  and 
present  their  major  characteristics.  It is recommended  that  all  readers,  even 
those  knowledgeable  in  this  area,  study  the  following  definitions,  as  they 
will  provide  the  framework  of analysis  used  in the  book. 

DERIVATIVES 

@  A  derivative  is a  security  whose  price  ultimately  depends  on  that  of an- 
other  asset  (called  underlying).  There  are  different  categories  of deriva- 
tives,  ranging  from  something  as  simple  as  a  future  to  something  as 
complex  as  an  exotic  option,  with  all  the  shades  in between. 

The  best  way  to  look  at  derivatives  is  to  separate  them  into  two  broad 
categories:  linear  and  nonlinear  derivatives.  A  linear  derivative  is  easy  to 
hedge  and  lock  in  completely,  whereas  a  nonlinear  one  will  present  serious 
instability  and  require  dynamic  hedging. 

@  A nonlinear  derivative  with  respect  to  a  parameter  is one  that  presents 
a second  derivative  (or partial  derivative  with  respect  to  that  parameter) 
different  from  0. 

The  option  wizard  presents  a  graphic  linear  or  nonlinear  derivative  view  of 
the  concept  of nonlinearity. 

Risk  Management  Rule: 
dependent  in their  price. 

All  nonlinear  derivatives  are  time- 

This  rule  is  explored  in  the  contamination  principle  and  will  be  dis- 
cussed  throughout  this  book.  For  now,  it is enough  to  state  that  nonlinearity

Option  Wizard:  The  Greeks 

The  “Greeks,”  as  option  traders  call  them,  denote  the  sensitivity  of the  option 
price  with  respect  to  several  parameters.  The  following  are  basic  definitions  for 
use  in  Part  |. These  terms  will  be  explored  in  greater  detail  later  in  this  book.

Option  Wizard:  The  Hedger’s  Viewpoint 

Throughout  this  book,  think  of a  derivative  in terms  of  its  replication  costs.  For 
this  purpose,  the  world  is divided  into  two  categories:  the  user  and  the  manu- 
facturer.  Their  utility  function  and  even  results  will  be  entirely  different.  The 
user  is  involved  in  terminal  value  (usually),  while  the  manufacturer  engages  in 
dynamic  hedging  (when  he  is  doing  his  job  right),  which  markedly  alters  the 
product. 

A dynamic  hedger  will  not  be  interested  in whether  he owns a put or a Call 
(first-order  hedges  will  make  them  identical).  What  matters  is  the  strike  and 
the  expiration. 

is gamma  (or more  generally  called  convexity)  and  that  gamma  needs  to be 
accompanied  by time  decay  (the  “rent”). 

Derivatives  are  not  always  linear,  convex,  or  concave  across  all  moves 
(se€é  Figures  1.2A—D).  A test  of local  linearity  of a  derivative  security  (that 
is  a  function  of the  underlying  asset)  between  asset  prices  S, and  S,, with 
0<A<1,  will  satisfy  the  following  equality  : 

VAS,  +  (1 —  A)S,) =A  V(S,) + (1  —  AV(S,) 

It will  be  convex  between  S, and  S, ie 

Vi Nee  (leah) 5)) =  Vleet  (bo  A) V (G5) 

It will  be  concave  if: 

Rettasy: sane 

VAS, +  (1 —  A)S,) =A  V(S,) + (1 —  AV(S,) 

Option  Wizard:  Linear  and  Nonlinear  Securities 

Although  we  are  initially  considering  linearity  with  respect  to  the  underlying 
asset,  this  notion  will  be  later  extended  to  other  parameters  such  as  interest 
rates  and  volatility. 

As  the  graphical  representation  at  the  top  of page  12  shows,  a linear  secu- 
rity  constantly  behaves  like  a  line.  In  option  parlance,  it will  have  a  delta  but 
no  other  Greeks,*  and  certainly  no  curvature.  Linear  securities  require  little  or 
no  dynamic  hedging. 

*The  Greeks  initially  represented  the  various  derivatives  of  the  Black-Scholes-Merton  formula. 
By extension,  it became  any  sensitivity  of a  derivative  security  with  respect  to  a  particular  mar- 
ket  parameter.

Many  securities  exhibit  some  linearity  until  the  test  of  fire.  These  in- 
struments  are  called  “quasi-linear”  securities.  Convexity  affects.  many  fi- 
nancial  instruments,  even  those  least  suspected. 

The  contamination  principle,  we  will  see,  dictates  a  ies nonlinear 
security  commands  time  value,  positive  if the  security  is corivex  and  nega- 
tive  if it is  concave.

SYNTHETIC  SECURITIES 

@  A synthetic  security  is a  linear  combination  of two  or  more  primary  in- 

struments  in the  markets. 

A basket’s  price  is derived  from  a  weighted  combination  of existing  primary 
instruments.  For  example,  Standard  &  Poor’s  500  (SP500)  contract  is  a 
weighted  average  of  the  components.  It can  therefore  be  exactly  replicated 
with  a mixture  of the  components  (for those  who  have  the  time  and  patience 
to  leg the  500  stocks).  A European  currency  unit  (ECU)  is  another  example

Option  Wizard:  The  First  Derivative  Trade 

The  earliest  option  trade  on  record  in  Western  literature  was  a  bet  on  future 
crop  by Thales  of  Miletus,  which  Aristotle  recounted  with  great  pride  in  his 
Politics.*  To  benefit  from  a  better  than  expected  olive  crop,  Thales  put  a  de- 
posit  on  every  olive  press  in  the  vicinity  of Miletus.  As  demand  for  these  grew, 
he  sublet  the  facilities  for  profit,  mostly  to  make  the  point  that  philosophers 
who  so  desire  can  achieve  material  success.  The  dichotomy  between  the 
“MIT-smart”  and  the  “Brooklyn-smart,”  today  prevalent  on  Wall  Street,  was  al- 
ready  apparent  in  fifth-century  Asia  Minor.  Thales  used  the  first  derivative  in- 
strument,  actually  an  option  on  a  future,  a  second-order  derivative  at  that!  He 
did  not  trade  olives,  which  he  would  have  had  to  sell  short,  but  chose  to  buy 
the  equivalent  of  a  call  on  the  olive  presses,  for  fall  delivery,  with  the  knowl- 
edge  that  all  he  could  lose  was  his  deposit. 

*See  Russell  (1945). 

of  an  arithmetic  average.  A  basket  composed  of  20%  stock  A  and  80%  V 
stock  B can  easily  be  replicated  with  the  purchase  of every  component. 

Synthetic  securities  are  not  always  linear,  but  exceptions  are  rare  enough 
for  us  not  to  bother  with  them.  For  example,  when  the  average  of the  instru- 
ments  is  not  arithmetic,  some  oddities  can  result.  The  U.S.  dollar  index, 
traded  on  FINEX  will  present  some  convexity  owing  to  the  geometric  nature 
of the  averaging  and  will  therefore  trade  at  a  premium  to  the  underlying  se- 
curities  for  that  reason.  The  nonlinearity  that  results  from  the  convexity  can 
cause  a  neutral  person  to  benefit  from  a  market  move  either  way,  which  can 
make  one  side  of the  arbitrage  more  desirable.  Convexity,  which  will  be  de- 
fined  later  on,  usually  commands a price  since  Wall  Street  rarely  grants  free 
lunches. 

Example: 
The  Elevator  Bank  issues  its  own  “mother  of all baskets”  and 
emits  some  notes,  the  payoff  of which  is indexed  off the  basket.  The  offi- 
cial  reason  is  that  the  basket  effectively  tracks  inflation  or  some  other 
indicator.  The  true  reason  is that  the  basket  will  have  a  lower  volatility 
than  the  sum  of the  instruments  and  is believed  to  be easy  to  hedge. 

TIME-DEPENDENT  LINEAR  DERIVATIVES 

@  Time-dependent  linear  derivatives  are  instruments  separated  from  the 

original  asset  through  time.

Option  Wizard:  The  Contamination  (or Convexity)  Principle 

The  most  important  notion  in  option  hedging  and  trading  is the  contamination 
principle:  It is the  fundamental  principle  of dynamic  hedging.  It means  roughly 
that  if there  is  a  possible  spot  in  time  and  space  capable  of  bringing  a  profit, 
then  the  areas  surrounding  it need  to  account  for  that  effect. 

The  contamination  principle  is  similar  to  the  notion  of  heat  transfer.*  If a 
spot  is located  near  a  source  of heat,  then  its  temperature  will  rise  accordingly. 
cay asset  price  nears  a  level  that  would  bring  a  sizable  profit  to  the  portfolio 
then  the  area  surrounding  it should  cause  a  modicum  of profit  as  well.) 

Iythe  following  chart,  a  derivative  will  pay  $1  million  should  some  event 
také  place  in  the  market.  Starting  at  a  given  point,  the  security  pays  on  the 
node  to  the  right.  It would  then  be  unreasonable  to  think  that  such  a  security 
would  be worth  nothing  at  Point  So.  One  standard  deviation  move  should  result 
in  a  payoff  of $1,000,000  (or  part  of that  sum).

Every  experienced  trader,  seeing  the  payoff  and  the  probability  attached  to 
it, would  buy the  derivative  security.  The  derivative  would  then  be worth  more 
than  0, and  it is easy  to  see  time  value  taking  shape  in the  following  chart:

However,  time  value  means  time  decay.  As  shown  in  the  following  chart, 
with  everything  remaining  the  same,  the  option  would  decrease  in  time  value 
at  the  standard  deviations  as  the  payoff  becomes  less  likely:

The  final  chart  shows  that  when  the  points  are  far  from  each  other  (as  in 

option  prices),  a  convex  line  forms. 

Convexity

This  example  suggests  why  an  option  has  “convexity.” 

Asset  Price 

a ee of the  designation  contamination  resides  in  the  price  of an  option  “contaminating” 
Hose  around  it.  When  an  option becomes  expensive,  those  around  it need  to  follow.  Likewise, 
\_ 
one  can  see  that  if an  Arrow-Debreu  price  rises  those  around  it  need  to  increase  as  well.  They 
are  then  said  to  contaminate  each  other. 

A swap  is a Sela  a  a  ae as  the  second-order  derivative 
with  respect  to  the  asset  price  is  equal  (or  close  to)  zero.  In  trader’s  par- 
lancertts hedge  ratio  is not  supposed  to change  relative  to movements  in the 
underlying  asset)  although  it can  be  argued  that  there  is no  such  thing  as  a 
purely  linear  derivative. 

Time-dependent  linear  derivatives  include: 

¢  Forwards. 

They are  agreements  to swap  some  proceeds  in the  future. 

¢  Floating  Rate  Agreements  (FRAs),  Eurodollars. 

They  will,  for  the 
purpose  of this  book,  be  forward-forwards  that  can  be  broken  down 
into  strips  of products  that  start  period  t and  end  period  t +  1. 

¢  Swaps. 

Whatever  their  end  use  (this  is  not  of  any  concern  here), 
they  can  be  composed  into  a  combination  of  Eurodollars  or  FRAs. 
Most  of  their  complexity  comes  from  being  detail-heavy,  but  they 
otherwise  exhibit  well-behaved  features. ' 

Aside  from  the  correlation  between  a  future  price  and  its  financing, 
most  of  the  difficulties  of  these  assets  lie  in  the  problem  of  interpolation 

16 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

between  two  points.  The  way  time  treats  them  is not  always  easy  to  ascer- 
tain.  A  lesser,  but  no  small,  difficulty  resides  in the  multiplication  of 
minute  details  such  as  the  conventions  on  the  delivery  or  the  360/365-day 
basis  and  other  rules  that  no  trader  was  ever  known  to  memorize. 

NONCONTINGENT  TIME-DEPENDENT 
NONLINEAR  DERIVATIVES 

_W/ Noncontingent  time-dependent  nonlinear  derivatives  represent  instru- 
ments  that  are  convex,  concave,  or  mixed  (with  respect  to  the  underly- 
ing asset)  but  that  are  not  options  (i.e.,  noncontingent). 

The  infamous  LIBOR-square  (London  Interbank  Offer  Rate)  for  example, 
provides  a  lurid  example  of  such  convexity.  The  LIBOR  cube  will  have  a 
third  derivative  (a convexity  of the  curvature)  but  the  product  does  not  ap- 
pear  very  likely  to  sell  heavily.  Despite  their  payoffs,  however,  these  instru- 
ments  do  not  constitute  an  option  since  both  parties  are  obligated  to  swap 
the  proceeds.  The  strangeness  of their  payoff  is that  they  are  generally  con- 
vex  above  a  point  and  concave  below,  or  vice  versa.  The  acceleration  of the 
positive  payoffs  on  one  side  is balanced  by the  acceleration  of the  negative 
payoffs  on  the  other. 

Example: 
The  Elevator  Bank  sells  to  its  customers  in  the  area  sur- 
rounding  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  a  note  paying  to  its  holder  the  square  of the 
interest  rate  move  (between  inception  and  some  predetermined  time  in 
the  future).  The  customer,  stressed  out  by low  interest  rates,  would  thus 
be  compensated  in  an  accelerated  way  against  further  rate  drops.  The 
note  looks  like  an  option,  and  being  (on the  surface)  arduous  to hedge,  it 
will  sell  for  higher  than  “fair”  value. 

OPTIONS  AND  OTHER  CONTINGENT  CLAIMS 

The  price of options  depends  on  contingent  events.  They represent  the bulk  of 
this  study.  They  are  the  culprit,  the  topic  of this  book.  A swap  is a  linear  de- 
rivative  while  a  path-dependent  swap  will  present  uncertain  payoffs.  In  the 
past,  operators  defined  these  instruments  as  tools  with  “optionality,”  where 
one  party  had a right to  choose  and  the  other  one  was  under  an  obligation. 

We  will  study  options  at  two  levels.  Level  1 is a  conventional  presenta- 
tion  of the  product,  as  if the  exotic  option  markets  did  not  exist.  Level  2 will 
go  into  a  more  generalized  presentation  of the  option  markets  that  would 
encompass  both  vanilla  and  exotics  (Chapter  2).

Option  Wizard:  The  Contamination  Principle  and  LIBOR  Square 

| LIBOR  square  is  a  contract  with  a  mixed  payoff:  convex  in  one  zone  and  con- 
cave  in  another.  At  the  origin  (where  the  contract  is set),  it is neither.)  According 
to  the  contamination  principle,  the  contract  needs  to  be  higher  than  its  value  on 
the  line  in  areas  where  it is long  gamma  and  lower  in  areas  where  it is short.*

ee square  is  a  contract  that  pays  to  one  party  the  square  of  the  difference  between  the

price  and  the  origin.

Simple  Options 

Options  are  contingent  claims,  and  thus  distinguish  themselves  from  other 
products  in being  a  potential  asset  for one  party  and  a potential  liability  for 
another.  This  contingency  in  their  value  subjects  them  to  probability  the- 
ory.  All  option  pricing  consists  therefore  in dealing  with  probability. 

m@  A  put  is  the  right  to  sell  an  instrument  at  a  certain  price  (the  strike 
price)  within  some  time  frame.  A call  is the  right  to buy the  instrument. 

With  the  opening  of  many  new  instruments,  puts  or  calls  can  be 
confused.  They  depend  on  the  numeraire.  For  a  currency  pair,  a  put 
on  Mark/Dollar  (the  right  to  sell  Marks  and  buy  dollars)  is  a  call  on 
Dollar /Mark.  Similarly,  a  put on  yields  is a  call  on  bonds,  a matter  of some 
confusing  importance  since  one  illustrious  exchange  defined  a  contract  on 
yield  (thus  inventing  an  asset),  while  most  cash  instruments  are  traded  ac- 
cording  to  their  price. 

An  interesting  extension  is that  a  call  on  the  SP500  is a  put on  cash  for 
someone  whose  P/L  is  computed  in  SP500  units  (the  case  of indexed  fund 
managers).  More  on  that  later.

@  A European  option  can  only be  exercised  onthe  last  day.  An  American 
option  can  be  exercised  any  time  between  its  inception  and  the  end 
date.  A hybrid,  the  Bermudan  option  can  be  exercised  on  a  set  number 
of days between  inception  and  expiration. 

@  Intrinsic  value,  for  a  call,  or  the  in-the-money  part  of  an  option  is  the 
difference  between  the  asset  value  and  the  strike  price  if that  difference 
is  positive.  It is zero  if the  difference  is negative.  For  a  put,  it is  the  re- 
ees a  European  option  (an option  that  is  only  exercisable  on  one 
date), 
value is typically  expressed  by traders  (by conven- 
tion)  as  the  difference  between  the  strike  and  the  corresponding  for- 
ward.  Since  the  option  is not  exercised  before  expiration,  the  only price 
that  matters  is the  term  market  price  of the  asset  (for delivery  on  the  ex- 
piration  of the  option). 

the  intrinsic 

The  best  way  intuitively  to  test  whether  any  particular  instrument  is an 
option  is to  see  if the  payoff  is asymmetric  and  if there  is a  strike  price  (Fig- 
ure  1.3).  A call  option  is priced  at expiration  as  the 

Max  (S —  K, 0) 

with  S the  asset  price  at  expiration  and K the  strike  price.  It is read  as  the 
greater  of the difference  between  the asset  price at expiration  and  the strike  or  zero. 

Introduction  to  the  Instruments

This  simple  formula  means  in  English  that  the  owner  collects  some 
amount  (intrinsic)  or  nothing,  whichever  is greatest.  S —  K is the  difference 
between  spot  and  strike.  When  it is negative,  the  operator  would  prefer  to 
receive  nothing. 

A put option  will  be expressed  as 

Maxi(k  =7S;  0) 

@  Forwards  and  futures  are  contracts  to  unconditionally  exchange  an 

asset  at  a  predetermined  date  for  an  agreed-on  price. 

They  are  straight  claims,  with  assets  and  liabilities  on  both  sides  of the 
fence  (as opposed  to  options  where  one  party  has  an  asset  and  the  other a li- 
ability).  They  also  distinguish  themselves  from  options  because  the  payoff 
does  not  give  any  party  the  element  of  choice.  As  will  be  explained  later, 
some  minor  technicalities  in  the  definition  of  the  futures  contracts  (truly, 
very  minor)  such  as  the bond  futures*  spawned  an  entire  cottage  industry  of 
arbitrageurs,  analysts,  and  the  like.

Another  intuitive  way  to  understand  an  option  is to  think  of it as  half 
the  forward  or  future:  The  long  partakes  of  the  upside  (above  a  certain 
point,  called  the  strike  price)  and  the  short  partakes  of the  downside,  for  a 
fee.  It is no  wonder  that  being  long a  put and  short a call  replicates  entirely 
the  future  (of course,  there  are  questions  of early  exercise  that  we  will  ig- 
nore  initially). 

Options  proliferate  in  daily  life,  some  of  which  people  are  long  (they 
own  the  choice)  for  some  of which  people  are  short.  A chief  executive  officer 
owns,  by virtue  of his  position,  an  option.  The  manager  can  partake  of the 
upside  of the  company  and  get a bonus  when  the  performance  is acceptable. 
Should  the  industry  experience  a  downturn  and  the  company  go bankrupt, 
the  CEO’s  sole  risk  would  be  his  job or  some  unpleasant  but  otherwise  fi- 
nancially  harmless  castigation.  He  will  not  be  asked  to  appear  before  the 
board  with  his  checkbook  in  hand.  It is easy  to  see  that  the  strike  price  for 
the  bonus  is  the  required  performance  and  that  the  shareholders  sold  (or, 
rather,  gave)  that  option  to  the  manager.’ 

Forwards,  options,  and  futures  represent  the  bulk  of derivatives  instru- 
ments.  A later  section  in this  chapter  will  present  a  more  advanced  version 
of options. 

HARD  AND  Sort  OPTIONALITY 

@  Optionality  is  a  broad  term  used  by traders  to  describe  a  nonlinearity 
in the  payoff  of an  instrument.  It is often  applied  to  convex  instruments 
or  to  situations  like  a  “stop  loss”  or  a  known  order  in the  market. 

As  an  extension  of  the  contamination  principle,  every  item  with  op- 
tionality  needs  to  trade  at  a  premium  and  the  shrinkage  of  premium 
with  the  passage  of  time  (owing  to  the  narrowing  of  the  probability 
measure  of events)  will  mean  necessarily  that  every  item  with  optional- 
ity will  have  time  decay. 

It is convenient  to  call  hard  optionality  the  situation  where  a  contract  has  a 
strike  price  and  soft  optionality  the  situation  where  the  contract  has  a built- 
in  convexity  but  no  real  strike  price.  Soft  optionality  presents  generally 
milder  gamma  and  other  Greeks  but  will  present  more  stable  features 
across  time. 

Basic  RULEs  OF  OPTIONS  EQUIVALENCE 

Below  are  the  basic  rules  of what  traders  call  “option  algebra.” 

°  WPuteall parity for  a  European  option:  Long  call/short  put  =  Long 

orward,  provided  they are  all  of the  same  strike. 

Introduction  to  the  Instruments

Warning  Expiration: 
call  parity  not  to hold  for  listed  options. 

“Pin  Risks”  (described  in Chapter  13) cause  put- 

Replacing  a  long with  a  “+”  sign and  the  short  with  a  “  —  ”  sign  allows 

for  the  following  simple  arithmetic: 

Position  equivalence: 

> 

GCHAR  SEMA  long  forward  is  equal  to  a  long  call/short  put  of  the 
same  strike. 

Hence: 

+C  =  P +  F. Long a call  is equivalent  to  long a  put/long  a  future. 

And 

+P  =C  —  F. Long  a  put is equivalent  to  long a  call/short  a  future. 

e  For  a  “soft”  American  option  (see  definition  later  in  this  chapter), 

the  put-call  parity  rules  hold  but  with  a  weaker  equivalence. 

¢  For  “hard”  American  options,  the  rule  becomes  more  slippery.  More 
complex  rules  are  described  in Chapter  15.  It is recommended  for  the 
nonspecialist  to  completely  ignore  put-call  parity. 

Example:  Assume  that  the  3-month  102  Put  trades  for  $1.975,  that  the 
3-month  102  Call  trades  for  $2.9625,  and  that  the  forward  for  the  exact 
delivery  date  for  both  trades  for  101.00. 

At  expiration,  assuming  financing  at  5%,  the  call  will  cost 
$1.975  x  .05  x  (90/360)  =  .025  and  the  put  will  cost  .0375.  We  will 
then  have  the  P/L  shown  in  Table  1.1.

Table  1.1  shows  the  profile  at expiration.  If two  trades  are  identical  at ex- 
piration  everywhere  on  the  map  of possible  prices,  and if they  expire  on  the 
same  day,  then  the  trades  will  have  the  same  risk  and  profit/loss  profile 
during  their  life. 

The  following  rule  applies  to  all  markets,  properly  rescaled,  provided 
they  are  European  and  present  liquid  forwards.  To  make  that  rule  accept- 
able  for  the  future,  proper  allowance  needs  to be made  for  the  “tailing”  (see 
Chapter  7). 

Mirror  Image  Rule 

A unit  of  a put  +  x%  of the  unit  in forward  =  1 unit  of a  call  +  (100  —  x)% 

of the  unit  in forward,  all  of the  same  strike  and  expiration. 

This  rule  is  obvious:  A  put  delta  neutral  at  30%  is  equal  to  P +  .3F  = 
(C —  F) +  .3F  =  C  —  .7F.  If a  103  put has  a  forward  delta  of 30%  the  103  call 
will  have  a  forward  delta  of 70%.  This  formula  uses  forward  delta,  not  cash 
deltas  that  need  to be adjusted  for.  Most  risk  management  systems  disclose 
the  cash,  not  the  forward  delta,  as  does  the  canonical  Black-Scholes-Merton 
formula. 

wi AN Sissetiars  European  options  need  to  be  hedged  with  the  forward,’  not 
cash.|  However,  most  commercial  pricing  systems  tend  to  disclose  the 
spot  hedge  instead,  which  often  can  be  misleading.  Traders  often  have 
recourse  to  cash  for  short-term  hedges  owing  to  the  lack  of liquidity  in 
the  forwards.  This  habit  generally  leads  them  to  forget  the  exact  condi- 
tions  for  adequate  put/call  parity. 

ma forward  delta  for  a  European  option  is  the  equivalent  cash  position 

with  the  same  delivery  date  as  the  underlying  asset. 

For  an  American  option,  a  forward  delta  is typically  of uncertain  dura- 
tion.  Such  a  duration,  however,  is  generally  calculated  and  called  the 
“omega”  (discussed  later  in  this  chapter),  but  will  be  too  unstable  for  us  to 
use  for  adequate  equivalence. 

Consequently,  a  straddle  will  be  equal  to  two  calls  delta  neutral  or  two 
uts  delta  neutral  (of the  same  strike).  Assume  that  the  forward  delta  of  a 
put is 30%: 

straddle  =  2P  +  6F  =2(C  =F)  +  6F  =2C  =  2F  4  6F  =  2G  —  1.4F

A  98-100-102  condor  is  defined  as  long  a  98  put,  long  a  102  call,  and

same  P/L  profile  for  the  following: 

Long  98,  long  102,  short  twice  the  100,  all  calls  or  all  puts.

Long  the  98  calls,  long the  102  puts,  short  the  100  straddle.

should  be  exactly  equal  to  that  of a  corresponding  in-the-money  call  of  the 
same  strike.

Risk  Management  Rules: 
Traders  should  never  carry  put-call  parity  rules  outside  of a  strike. 
Seme  of  the  preceding  rules  can  be  used  with  soft  American  op- 

\Ations,  except  when  the  delta  of the  option  becomes  too  high. 

AMERICAN  OPTIONS,  EARLY  EXERCISE,  AND 
OTHER  HEADACHES  (ADVANCED  Topic) 

An  American  option  poses  more  problems  than  European  options  because 
the  path  followed  by the  underlying  asset  can  lead  to  possible  early  exer- 
cise.  With  a  European  option,  pricing  is  a  simple  matter:  One  can  just  dis- 
count  the  final  payoffs  on  expiration  day. 

Without  getting  immersed  in the  pricing  complications  of American  op- 
tions,  it is safe  to  say  that  the  complexity  arises  because  uncertainty  about 
the  date  of occurrence  of the  early  exercise  makes  it difficult  to  model.°  The 
rules  depend  on  time  and  the  amount  of intrinsic  value,  which  makes  the 
early  exercise  rules  too  uncertain. 

‘ 

Such  early  exercise  is generally  determined  two  ways:  the  soft  (or easy) 

rule  and  the  hard  rule. 

é 

a American  Options 

MA soft  American  option  (also  called  a  pseudo-European  option)  is only 
subjected  to  early  exercise  from  the  standpoint  of  the  financing  of the 
intrinsic  value. 

n  extension  of this  definition  is that  only one  interest  rate,  that  affect- 
ing the  financing  of the  premium  for  the  operator,  impacts  the  decision  to 
early  exercise. 

For  risk  management  and  trading  purposes,  soft  American  options  will 
be  largely  similar  to  the  European  options,  except  when  interest  rates  be- 
come  very  high  relative  to  volatility.  The  reason  they  are  often  called 
pseudo-European  options  is that  they  behave  in  general  like  European  op- 
tions,  except  when  very  deep  in  the  money.(The 
test  of  early  exercise  is 
whether  the  total  option  value  is less  than  the  time value of the money be- 
tween  the  time  of consideration  and  expiration 

Example:  Assume  that  an  asset  trades  at $100,  with  interest  rates  at 6% 
(annualized)  and  volatility  at  15.7%.  Assume  also  that  the  3-month  80 

Introduction  to  the  Instruments

call  is worth  $20,  at least  if it is American.  Forgoing  early exercise  would 
create  an  opportunity  cost  of 20  x  90/360  x  .06  =  .30  cents,  the  financ- 
ing of the  $20  premium  for  3 months.  The  time  value  of the  equivalent 
put  is close  to  zero  (by put-call  parity),  so  the  intelligent  operator  can 
swap  the  call  into  the  underlying  asset  and  buy  the  put  to  replicate  the 
same  initial  structure  at a better  cost.  He  would  end  up  long the  put and 
long the  underlying  asset. 

Hard  American  Options 

@  A hard  American  option  is  an  option  subjected  to  early  exercise  tests 
and  the 

from  the  standpoint  of both  the  financing  of the  intrinsic  v 
carry  costs  of the  underlying  asset  until  the  nominal  expiration. 

i ARy extension,  two  rates,  that  of the  premium  for  the  operator,  and  that 
of the  carry  of the  underlying  asset  impact  the  decision  to  early  exercise. 

An  early  exercise  can  thus  be  attributed,  in  addition  to  the  soft  Ameri- 
can  rule,  to the  yield benefits  of an  early position  in the  asset.  The  following 
filter  needs  to 
be  taken  into  account  at  all  times  during  the  life  of  the  op- 
tion:(Would  the  operator  do  better  if he  owned  an  interest-bearing  asset 
than if he  owned  the  equivalent  position  through  the  options? ) 

Exgmple: 
The  operator  owns  the  same  call  as  earlier,  but  the  underly- 
mg asset  is  a  currency  that  pays  20%  interest  while  domestic  rates  are 
6%.  The  option  trader  has  the  additional  benefit  of  exercising  the  call 
because,  on  top  of the  financing,  he  can  own  the  currency  that  pays  the 
high  interest  rates  against  his  home  currency,  which  costs  him  only  6% 
to  short,  therefore  earning  approximately  14%  annualized  on  the  same 
value.  The  benefits  of early  exercise  from  the  asset  ownership  are  much 
higher  than  in the  previous  case:  .14  x  100  (face  value) 
90/360  =  $3.5. 
In addition  to  that,  the  trader  has  the  value  of getting  the  cash  much  ear- 
lier,  which  was  computed  in  the  previous  case  at  $.30.  The  operator 
should  perhaps  have  exercised  the  option  much  earlier  to  benefit  from 
this  extra  kicker. 

Likewise  the  put on  the  high-yielding  currency  will  not  be subjected 
to  early  exercise.  Take  the  following  rule:  A  market  trades  at  100.  The 
120  put  with  $20  of  intrinsic  value  will  be  better  held  till  expiration 
since  the  operator  would  have  to  pay  $3.50  to  hold  the  equivalent  short 
position  in  financing  differential.  True,  the  30  cents  of  financing  the 
premium  would  be  deducted  from  that  value  in  the  cost-benefits  analy- 
sis.  So  the  put  would  not  be  early  exercised  by an  optimal  operator.  It 
will  trade  and  will  be considered  for  all  intents  and  purposes  as  a  Euro- 
pean  instrument.° 

26 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

These  rules  of hard  early  exercise  extend  to  the  following  instru- 

ments: 
¢  Bonds  with  a  Positive  Carry.  American  calls  are  early  exercisable 
when  the bond  is financed  more  cheaply  than  its yield.  American  puts 
will  therefore  be  similar  to  (but  not  quite  the  same  as) European  puts. 

¢  Bonds  with  a  Negative  Carry. 

The  reverse  is true. 

¢  Equities.  When  the  equities  are  negative  carry  (and  the  dividend 
payout  is known),  the  calls  resemble  European  ones  and  vice  versa. 

Never  trust  the  price  for  an  American  option’  on  a  cash  instrument. 
There  may  be  changes  in  the  parameters  throughout  the  life  of  the  in- 
strument  (nondividend  paying  stocks  starting  to  pay,  changes  in  inter- 
est  rates,  reversal  of  the  interest  rate  differential)  that  can  affect  its 
future  value.  Parameters,  unfortunately,  are  not  frozen. 

Options  on  futures,  therefore,  will  be  considered  subject  to  the  soft 
exercise  rules.  We  will  generally  fold  them  within  the  category  of Euro- 
pean  instruments  for  the  purpose  of our  analysis.  At all  times,  the  test 
will  be  that  of  the  financing  of  the  premium;  differences  only  become 
pertinent  between_European  and  American  options  for  deep  in-the- 
money  instruments. 

° 

} 

European  instruments  tend  to  prevail  where  there  are  differences 
in the  pricing  mechanism.  The  market  generatly  seems  to  go to  the  most 
liquid  instrument,  and  operators—by  shying  away  from  complicated 
options—make  them  less  attractive  to  trade.  European  options  domi- 
nate  with  the  currencies,  and  represent  close  to  99%  of  the  volume  of 
those  with  a  high differential. 

Option  Wizard:  The  Simplicity  Rule 

A major  rule  should  be taken  into  account:  The  market  always  tends  to  flow  to 
simplicity.  Complexity  is generally  costlier  to  both  monitor  and  produce,  and 
somehow  in  the  long  run,  demand  moves  away  from  the  complex  in  favor  of 
the  simple.  New,  elaborate  contracts  certainly  attract  people,  but  typically  the 
novelty  wanes.  Operators  will  then  try  to  satisfy  their  needs  for  protection  by 
seeking  the  cheapest  possible  way. 

Complex  products  cost  more  to  replicate.  An  optimal  operator  becomes 
cost  conscious  and  avoids  enriching  the  financial  institutions  when  he  can  sat- 
isfy  his  interests  more  economically.  This  becomes  noticeable  with  the  life  or 
death  of listed  financial  instruments.  It is the  recipe  for the  survival  of exchange 
contracts.  That  rule  will  be  discussed  in  the  study  of exotic  options.

A Brief  Warning  about  Early  Exercise  Tests 

Most  operators  have  their  risk  management  system  flag  an  early  exercise 
and  routinely  terminate  the  option.  This  is  often  less  than  optimal  (and 
downright  dangerous)  for  the  following  reasons: 

» One should  refine  the  test  by using  a  proper  volatility  for  the  corre- 
sponding  out-of-the-money  option  of the  same  strike.  Most  risk  man- 
smiles  correctly. 
agement  systems  do  not  apply 
For  example,  if the  option  early  exercise  test  is done  at a volatility  of 
16%  and  the  strike  price  concerned  trades  at  20%,  the  early  exercise 
flagged  by the  system  would  be erroneous. 

proper  volatilit 

the 

e  An  additional  refinement  should  be the  use  of a volatility  term  struc- 
ture  by  retesting  with  a  longer  or  shorter  duration,  inputting  the 
highest  possible  volatility  between  time  zero  and  the  expiration  of 
the  option. 

¢  When  dealing  with  a  large-size  position,  dealers,  upon  exercise,  syn- 
thetically  become  short  an  out-of-the-money  option.  It  is  recom- 
mended  to  test  for  the  liquidity  of  such  strike  in  the  market  and 
compute  the  replacement  costs. 

¢  A war  story:  The  day before  the  stock  market  crash  (of 1987)  X, a  mar- 
ket  maker  in  the  Eurodollar  options,  found  a  deep-in-the-money  “re- 
versal”  in his  books {(a reversal  means  that  the  trader  is long a  put,  short  a 
call, short  the future)\ According  to his  risk  management  system,  the  put 
was  early  exercisable.  He  exercised  the  put  staying  naked  the  calls. 
The  following  day,  the  market  experienced  a  10  standard  deviation 
rally  on  the  open,  putting  him  out  of business  and,  worse,  causing  his 
story  to  become  a  legend.  Ironically,  X  belonged  to  the  category  of 
“wings”  buyers  (people  who  always  own  out-of-the-money  options). 
He  never  shorted  “wing”  options  and  ended  up  hurt  by a  synthetic 
(and  entirely  accidental)  short. 

Consequence:  Smile-Calendars  (Advanced  Topic).  (The volatility  of  op- 
tions  of the  same  strike  needs  to  be  equal  to  allow  for  put-call parity equiv- 
alence. While this  rule  applies  unconditionally  for  European  options,  many 
operators  mistakenly  apply  it  to  the  American  variety.  In  some  cases,  the 
rules  can  be  applied,  and  in other  cases  they  need  to  be  lifted. 

hen a strong  skew is impacting 

the market,  the put-call  parity  can  be 

weakened  considerably  by the  following: 

e  A  rising  volatility  curve  could  separate  the  put  and  calls  from  each 
other  because  the  nonexercisable  leg would  follow  the  nominal  matu- 
rity,  whereas  the  exercisable  one  would  have  a  considerably  shorter 
expected  life.

Example:  Assume  that  3-month  options  trade  at  15.7%  volatility  but 
that  the  1-day  options  traded  at  13%.  An  exercisable  80  call  would  be 
priced  at  13%,  whereas  the  nonexercisable  leg (the  80  put)  would  trade 
at  20%. 

¢  A  strong  smile  (defined  as  an  implied  volatility  that  is  a  function  of 

the  strike  price  and  time  to  maturity)  can  present  worse  results. 

As  shown  in  Figure  1.5,  assume  that  the  80  strike  for  the 
Example: 
3-month  option  trades  at  20%  volatility  (point  A),  while  the  at-the- 
money  trades  at  15.7  for  3-month  (point  B) and  13%  for  1-day  options 
(point  C).  The  3-month  80  call  will  trade  at  13%  volatility  (point  C), 
while  the  80 put would  trade  at 20%. 

LR isk  Management  Rule: 

Hard  American  options  are  more  valu- 
able  than  European  options  of  the  same  expiration,  because  they 
harbor  a  compound  option  on  interest  rates  or  volatility.  The  differ- 
ence  between  them  increases  with  either  the  volatility  of volatility  or 
the  level  and  volatility  of interest  (or carry)  rates. 

e 

The  rule is  easy  to  explain  to traders  who  had to  live in highly  unstable 
> interest  rates or fluctuating implied  volatility  (vvol).  The  American  option 
gives  the  owner  the  right  to  pay  the  carry  to  “extend”  the  option  one 
additional  day and  therefore  make  a  bet  that  the  option  may  no  longer  be

exercisable.  As  such  it becomes  an  extendible  option  (for  a  discussion  of 
compound  options  see  Chapter  21). 

American  Options  Nobody  Ever  Exercises. 
Some  contracts  for  American 
options  do not  present  any  early  exercise  value.  They  are  the  options  on  fu- 
tures  where  there  is  a  marks-to-market  daily.  For  example:  London  Inter- 
bank  Financial  Future  Exchange  (LIFFE)  option  products  are  margined  as  a 
future.  The  profits  can  be taken  out  daily and  can  thus  earn  interest.  Buying 
a  deep-in-the-money  option  requires  a  much  smaller  outlay  of  cash  than 
other  markets. 

FORWARDS,  FUTURES,  AND  FORWARD-FORWARDS 
(ADVANCED  Topic) 

@  A  forward  contract  between  two  parties  obligates  both  of them  to  buy 
and  sell  a  given  asset  on  a  specified  date,  or  to  exchange  payments  ac- 
cording  to  a  formula. 

@  A  future  is  a  standardized  forward  contract  listed  on  an  exchange 
with  set  maturities  where  the  exchange  clearing  house  is the  counter- 
party.  Trades  take  place  in  an  open  outcry  system  and  the  liquidity  is 
improved  by the  standardization  and  the  interchangeability  between 
contracts. 

There  is  a  difference  in  hedge  ratios  between  the  forward  and  the fu- 
ture.  In  the  forward,  the  exchange  of payments takes  place  at  a  terminal 
date,  while  with  the  future  there  is  a  variation  margin  system  of  pay-as- 
you-go.  The  parties  need  to  exchange  payments  that  correspond  to  their 
daily  profit  or  fee winner  can  thus  earn  interest  on  the  profits.  Such  dif- 
ference  can  be  substantial  for  long-dated  instruments. 

To  hedge  a  forward  with  a  future,  the  trader  needs  to  tall  to  adjust 
for  the  difference  between  a  present  value  claim  and  a  cash  one.  The  hedge 
(number  of units  of futures  for  one  unit  of forward)  is: 

ies ail 

iy  ee 

where  f is  the  number  of  years  and r is  the  zero-rate  until  the  forward 
delivery.”  | 

A Example:  A  3-month  listed  future  on  the  Chicago  Merchantile  Ex- 
change  (CME)  in  the  Deutsche  Mark  (DEM)  against  the  U.S.  Dollar 
(USD)  trades  at  .70  cents  per  dollar  (one  whose  expiration  happens  to 
fall  exactly  90  days  from  today).  The  90-day  forward,  by arbitrage,  also 
trades  at  .70  (expressed  in spot  at  1.4286). 

30 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

What  is the  equivalent  Deutsche  mark  (DEM)  amount  to  100  futures 
(a  future  on  CME  represents  125,000  DEM)?  Assume  90-day  interest 
rates  are  6%. 

Total  face  value  is  DEM  12,500,000.  The  hedge  ratio  h  is  Exp 
[ —.06  X  .25]  =  .985,  number  of futures  for  one  forward.  The  hedge  in 
the  forward  is therefore:  12,500,000/.985  =  1,269,000. 

If the  DEM  future  immediately  moves  to  .71  the  profit  on  the  future 
leg will  be  $125,000  deliverable  immediately.  The  profits  in  the  forward 
will  be $126,900  but  will  be only a  mark-to-market  realizable  in 90 days. 

Credit 

Credit  is  another  difference  between  futures  and  the  forwards.  Generic 
swaps,  caps,  and  floors  (with  futures  equivalent  dates)  are  easy  to  hedge 
with  strips  and  Euro  options.  Going  to  the  over-the-counter  market  would 
create  a  mismatch  that  consumes  two-way  credit  facilities.  If  Credit  Syl- 
davia  engages  in a  swap  with  Banca  Nazionale  del  Lavoro,  both  parties  will 
reduce  their  credit  lines  to  each  other  and  swell  their  contingent  balance 
sheets.  Should  both  unwind  their  side  of  the  trade  at  different  times  with 
different  counterparties  who  in  turn  trade  with  each  other,  the  numbers 
would  multiply:  Each  of the  four  parties  would  reduce  the  size  of its  books 
and  have  its  lines  to  the  rest  of the  world  reducedas  well.  Had  all  the  trades 
taken  place  on  a  standardized  exchange,  everyone  would  be flat. 

Typically,  the  way  market  makers  operate  is  to  use  the  exchange  when 
initiating  a  trade  (when  they  act  as  a  customer)  and  to  trade  a  forward 
when  they  are  acting  as  a  market  maker,  with  other  parties  calling  them 
and  dealing  on  their  prices. 

Marks-to-Market  Differences 

The  marks-to-market  rules  create  non-trivial  differences  between  the  for- 
wards  (and  similar  instruments)  and  the  futures  (see Table  1.2).  Forwards  are 
self-marked  by operators  according  to  some  convention.  A few  points  are  up- 
dated  by the  trader  and  the  back  office  and  all  the  intermediate  points  on  the 
curve  are  computed  by whatever  algorithm  is used  by the  system. 

The  future,  on  the  other  hand,  is marked  by the  exchange  through  some 
well-defined  rules.  The  Eurodollar  curve,  about  40  contracts,  is  not  gener- 
ated  through  computer  algorithms  but  with  the  last  trade  or  bid/offer  in 
mind,  even  if the  resulting  curve  becomes  jagged.  An  operator  who  marks 
the  same  curve  with  fewer  points  will  generally  have  a  smoother  result. 

Another  issue  lies  in the  timing.  It is called  the  nonsynchronous  marked-to- 
market  problem.  Many  operators  carry  positions  on  one  exchange  offset 
against  positions  on  another.  Exchanges  do not  have  the  same  settlement  time. 
A future  marks-to-market  would  not  accurately  portray  the  resulting  P/L.

futures  in Singapore  and  the  Eurodollars  in  the  United  States.  The  bank 
marks  the  positions  at  4:30  p.m.  New  York  time,  while  the  Singapore  fu- 
tures  are  marked  before  he  starts  his  day in  New  York  and  the  Eurodol- 
lar  at  3:00  p.m.  New  York  time.  His  resultant  P/L  will  never  reflect  the 
accurate  liquidating  value  of his  position. 

The  Correlation  between  the  Future  and 
the  Financing  (Advanced  Issue) 

wy 

In  the  preceding  situations,  there  is  independence  between  the  financing 
rate  of  the  P/L  stemming  from  the  future  and  the  expected  moves  in  the 

32 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

future.  A  correlation  between  the  financing  and  the  future  will  translate 
into  a  convexity  or  concavity  of the  future  compared  with  the  forward. 

Risk  Management  Rule:  When  there  is  a  positive  correlation  be- 
tween  the  financing  rate  r and  a  future  contract  F!”  (on any  possi- 
ble  underlying  asset)  subjected  to  marks-to-market  rules,  the 
future  will  be convex  and  will  trade  above  the  forward  of the  same 
delivery. 

Converse:  Whenever  there  is  a  negative  correlation  between 
the  financing  rate  r  and  a  future  contract  F,  the  future  will  be 
concave  and  will  then  need  to  trade  at  a  lower  rate  than  a  corre- 
sponding  forward. 

An  illustration  of the  rule  in provided  in Chapter  10. 

Forward-Forward 

@  A 

forward-forward  is  a  contract  to  exchange  an  asset  at  one  period 

against  the  reverse  trade  at  a  later  period. 

For  quasi-linear  derivatives,  such  as  fixed-income  instruments,  it is the 

price  ratio  between  two  forwards. 

FF(t1,  #2)  =  F(t2)/F(t1) 

The  forward-forward  rate  is  determined  by  the  existing  rates  in  the 
market  interpolated  to  solve  for  the  break-even  rate  for  the  period  between 
fl  and  #2. 

The  Eurodollar  futures  are  forward-forward  deposits,  and  ironically, 
the  forward-forward  often  sets  the  spot  (the  tail  wagging  the  dog,  as  often 
repeated  in  future  circles). 

For  options,  the  forward-forward  is computed  with  the  nonlinearity  of 

time  in mind.  This  will  be dealt  with  in Chapter  9. 

Core  Risk  MANAGEMENT:  DISTINCTION  BETWEEN 
PRIMARY  AND  SECONDARY  RISKS 

Market  risks  can  be  primary  or  secondary,  but  sometimes  the  distinction 
can  be  counterintuitive;  some  instruments  and  markets  present  more  dan- 
ger  in  the  fringe  risks  than  in  their  primary  exposures. 

Introduction  to  the  Instruments 

33 

(A primary riskis one  that  constitutes  the  bulk  of the  variance  of profits 
and  losses  (the  P/L),  and  is where  most  hedging  efforts  should  be  concen- 
trated)Since  markets  move  rapidly,  it  is  easy  to  see  the  primary  risks  as 
those’a  trader  would  cover  first,  and  the  residual  risks  are  those  that  can 
usually  wait  until  the  end  of the  trading  session. 

The  following  classification  of risks  excludes  the  party-spoiling  corre- 
lation-based  products  (like  options  of  one  of  two  instruments  and  other 
goodies). 

¢  For  an  equity  derivatives  portfolio,  market  risks  are  almost  entirely 
directional,  with  all  the  possible  permutations  concerning  the  deriv- 
atives  of the  effect  of the  underlying  equities.  Matters  pertaining  to 
interest  rates  are  deemed  secondary,  as  the  thrust  of the  positioning 
is not  at  the  level  of these  parameters.  Someone  can  be  hurt  from  the 
indirect  effects  of an  interest  rate  change  on  a  long dated  stock  posi- 
tion  (through  the  effect  on  the  pricing  of the  forwards),  but  such  vari- 
ance  would  be  insignificant  compared  with  that  caused  by the  price 
action  and  the  changes  in  volatility.  Such  analysis  does  not  reflect 
the  possible  effect  of the  interest  rates  move  on  the  equity  markets, 
just  their  effect  on  the  time  structure  or  equity  prices.  The  health 
risks  of  passive  smoking  are  not  seriously  significant  to  a  man  al- 
ready  diagnosed  with  cancer. 

¢  For  a  fixed  income  derivatives  book,  however,  both  the  underlying 
asset  (that  is  the  cash  flow  schedules  as  discounted  by the  interest 
rates)  and  the  general  structure  of the  interest  rate  curve  need  to be 
taken  into  account  as  primary  risks.  This  is mostly  attributable  to  the 
consideration  that  fixed-income  positions  react  to  a  schedule  of 
prices  spread  over  time,  not  just to  one  price  like  an  equity  or  a  cur- 
rency.  Every  coupon  paying  fixed  income  security  is a  simple  sum  of 
smaller  zero-coupon  securities  with  different  expirations.  A  10-year 
swap’s  price  will  principally  be  affected  by the  10-year  rates.  It will 
also  be  affected  by the  4-year  rates,  everything  else  being  equal,  be- 
cause  of the  effect  on  the  reinvestment  over  the  period.  A term  struc- 
ture  becomes  an  integral  part  of  the  risks  and  rewards  of  every 
instrument  and  should  therefore  be considered  a  primary  risk. 

e  For  a  currency  book,  the  exchange  rate  of the  currency  pair  and  the 
volatility  are  the  primary  risks.  But  both  the  interest  rate  differen- 
tials  and  the  term  structures  of  interest  rates  are  preeminent;  they 
become  part  of the  primary  risks  with  some  categories  of developing 
markets  that  experience  a  high interest  rate  volatility. 

Such  classifications  need  to  adapt  to  most  possible  instruments:  Those 
who  have  tried  to  come  up  with  a  generalized  theory  of  risk  management 

34 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

have  so  far  failed  in  their  laborious  attempts.  No  two  instruments  will  be 
equal.  Traders,  therefore,  must  search  initially  for  common  points  between 
instruments. 

Tables  1.3  and  1.4  will  apply  to  the  SDF  (smallest  decomposable 

. 

fragment). 

Liquidity  is preeminent  as  a  risk  (the  invisible  risk  as  traders  concede).  It 
will  be examined  in this  book  at all  levels  without  fitting  it in any  category.

~~ Since  all 0 options -are basically  alike  this  fan adheres,  whenever  possi- 
ble,  to  a  standardized  example.  Most  examples  in  the  book  depict  option 
risks  for  a  generic  asset  with  a  flat  forward.  This  approach  simplifies  the 
effect  of the  projection  into  the  future  and  isolates  the  pure  option  risks  of 
the  instruments. 

In other  words  we  rescale  everything  to  a numeraire.  Hence  the  forward 
will  trade  at  100%  of cash  regardless  of the  expiration.  Such  simplification 
allows  a  focus  on  the  option  risks,  without  invalidating  the  real  issues. 
Where  the  simplification  leads  to  inaccuracies,  a  tradable  instrument  will 
be  used  taking  into  account  its  particularities.  The  drift  and  the  notion  of 
Girsanov  change  of probability  will  be  introduced  in  c4ses  where  it affects 
the  hedging  technique. 

Initially,  readers  will  measure  the  risks  of the  derivatives,  with  simple 
cases  where  a  “pure”  portfolio  is created.  The basic  “Greeks”  (vega,  gamma,

or  not.  This  will  be  followed  by a  thorough  presentation  of  the  modified 
delta,  the  modified  vega,  the  modified  theta,  and  the  modified  gamma. 
This  blanket  method  should  be possible  to  apply  to  all  instruments. 

The  generating  blocks  of some  exotic  options—bets,  barriers,  and  corre- 
lation—will  be  the  final  objects  of study.  Readers  will  be  shown  a  road  map 
for  extending  these  principles  to  other,  complex  instruments.  To  apply 
these  techniques  to  a  book  of specific  instruments,  it is  important  to  learn 
to  decompose  the  option  risk  from  the  residual  risks  proper  to  the  instru- 
ment.  This  is best  done  through  the  decomposition  of the  instrument  into 
liquid  traded  segments  (see  Figure  1.7). 

APPLYING  THE  FRAMEWORK  TO  SPECIFIC  INSTRUMENTS 

A  swap  is  simply  a  multiasset  instrument  composed  of  correlated  seg- 
ments  often  entirely  decomposable  into  very  liquid  Eurodollar  strips.  The 
framework  on  multiasset  options  and  the  techniques  of stacking  with  cor- 
relation  matrices  should  be  sufficient  for  the  trader  to  adapt  the  principles 
of  dynamic  hedging  to  swaps.  As  for  index-amortizing  swaps,  the  use  of

American  digital  options  should  perform  the  task,  mixed  with  some 
knowledge  of compound  options  where  applicable.  The  problem  with  most 
fixed-income  traders  is that  they tend  to  limit  their  knowledge  to  the  intri- 
cacies  of  the  instrument  rather  than  focus  on  the  generating  blocks.  This 
method  is  considerably  easier  than  the  holistic  Heath-Jarrow-Morton

Most  traders  distinguish  between  vanilla  and  exotic  options.  The  vanilla  op- 
tion  and  vanilla  forward  are  easily  priced  in the  market  and  benefit  from  liq- 
uid  markets.  A  nonconventional  structure  would  then  be  called  exotic.  On 
the  Chicago  Board  Options  Exchange  (CBOE),  where  puts  were  introduced 
in  1978,  Jim Piper?  recounts  that  puts  were  then  exotic  and  calls  vanilla. 

There  is no  true  functional  difference  between  the  products,  except  that 
pricing  exotic  options  often  seems  to  be  more  complicated.fFor  risk  man- 
agement  purposes,  six  dimensions,of  analysis  are  crucial  for  understanding 
and  pricing  options  (see  Figure  2.1).  ) 

Step  1.  THE  HOMOGENEITY  OF  THE  STRUCTURE 

a (a time-homogeneous  structure  refers  to  a  payoff  structure  that  does

form  with  respect  to  time,  between  inception  and  expiration. | 

Some  structures  have  restrictions  on  them  as  the  payoff  depends 
on  whether  some  event  took  place  before  or  after  a  specified  date.  So  the 
first  question  to  ask  is whether  the  structure  has  any  time-changing  char- 
acteristics. 

WZ 

‘Example: 
The  characteristics  of  a  deferred  strike  option  will  depend 
heavily  on  whether  amevent-takes  place before  the  day when  the  strike 
is set  or  after.  More  practically,  the  option  will  appear  to  have  no  delta 
and  no  gamma,’  but  will  have  some  vega  between  inception  and  the 
strike  setting  time.  After  the  strike  setting,  generally  the  settled  spot 
price  on  a  given  date,  it becomes  a  normal  vanilla  (boring)  option.  The 
contract  for  such  an  option  defines  two  periods—Period  1 when  the  op- 
tion  will  be (on paper)  gamma-less  and  so  on,  and  Period  2 when  the  Op- 
tion  will  present  vanilla  features.

Option  Wizard:  The  Smallest  Decomposable  Fragment  of a  Structure 

Every  structure  for  risk  management  purpose  needs  to  be  decomposed  into 
smaller  units  until  it is no  longer  deemed  decomposable. 

The  term  decomposable  means  “composed  of structures  added  together.” 

¢  A  double  barrier  option  is not  the  addition  of two  barrier  options. 

wa strangle,  however,  is the  addition  of a  put  and a call. 

e  A  European  double  bet  is  decomposable  into  two  European  single  bets.  An 

American  double  bet  (“either  or”)  is  not  decomposable. 

¢  An  option  on a basket  is not  decomposable  into  smaller  options  on  the  com- 
ponents.  Likewise  an  option  on  a  spread  is  not  decomposable  into  two  op- 
tions  on  the  components. 

ae Cap or  floor  options  are  decomposable  into  “caplets”  or  “floorlets.”  An  op- 
tion  on  a  swap,  called  swaption  by some,  is  not  decomposable  (it  is akin  to 
an  option  on a basket). 

e  A  European  barrier  option  will  not  be  covered  in  this  book  as  it  is  a  simple 

addition  of a  digital  and  a  call  spread. 

Some  options  are  limit  decomposable:  They  can  be  broken  down  into 
Souler Gptians DULin either Infinile amounts or in  strike  pairs  that  are  infi- 
nitely  narrow.  A  lookback  option  is decomposable  into  an  infinite  series  of 
knock-in  and  knock-out 
with strike  prices  infinitely  close  together.  A binary 
call is limit  decomposable  into  an  infinite  amount  of  infinitely  narrow call 
spreads,  and  that  knowledge  is  useful  in  trading  and  pricing  although  no- 
body  ever  tried  to  perform  the  replication. 

A  reminder:  For  a  risk-conscious  dynamic  hedger  (and  subjected  to  trans- 
action  costs),  the  returns  of  a  sum  of SDF  in  a  portfolio  will  be  markedly  dif- 
ferent  from  the  sum  of the  returns  of independently  managed  SDF. 

- 

“All  options  intrinsically  change  over  time  (The question here is whether 
the  contract  is  written  in  such  a  way  as  to  alter  the  payoff  after  certain 
dates\(F igure  2.2  shows  the  time  to  expiration “sliced”  in periods.  Each  pe- 
riod  Will have  its own  associated  payoff}  For  example,  a  window  option  is a 
barrier  option  where  the  barriers  are  lifted  after  a  certain  period. With  a 
flexible barrier option,  the  barriers  can  widen  by a  percentage  point  every 
month.  First month:  The  barrier  is  at  109  (with,  as  usual,  the  spot  at  100); 
second  month,  the  barrier is  at  110;  third  month,  at  111;  and  so  on. 

Nontime-homogeneous  structures  can  be  quite  difficult  to  manage. 
Later  chapters  will  describe  their  risks  and  how  to  handle  Greeks  that  can 
accommodate  the  changes  over  time.

They  also  can  be  the  most  difficult  to  price,  though  not  always.  The 
model  needs  to  take  into  account  that  the  payoff  changes  according  to  the 
period.  Quants  often  have  difficulties  with  options  that  are  very  easy  to 
hedge  (like  American  options)  and  find  it often  trivial  to  deal  with  options 
that  are  arduous  to  trade  (like  bets  and  binary  options). 

Step  2.  THE  TYPE  OF  PAYOFF: 
CONTINUOUS  AND  DISCONTINUOUS 

7 

a  psitat (discontinuous)  and  ramp  (continuous)  payoffs  are  the  two 
inds  of payoffs  (Figures  2.3  and  2.4)./Ramp  payoffs  are  continuous  be- 
tween  points,  and  digital  payoffs  pay  ‘all  or  nothing,”  with  no  shade  in 
between.  They  are  akin  to  bets  between  two  people  on  the  outcome  of 
an  event.

Example:  Assume  that  a  person  bets  on  the  outcome  of a  well-publicized 
murder  trial,  as  traders  often  do,  in  the  amount  of $1,000.  There  will  be 
no  intermediate  payoff between  the  loss  of $1,000  and  the  gain of $1,000. 
The  payoff  is then  said  to be discontinuous. 

There  are  two  (good  news/bad  news)  points  to  consider  when  dealing  with 
the  discontinuous  payoff  options. 

, 

1.  The  bad  news  is  that  almost  all  available  hedges  in  the  market  are 
continuous  payoff products,  therefore  creating  imperfect  or  unstable 
hedges.  There  may  be  constructions  that  provide  an  accurate  hedge 
(such  as  vertical  spreads),  but  these  constructions  are  too  costly  to 
execute  and  generally  are  unavailable. 

2.  The  good news  is that  the bet  option  has  a  small  bite.  It is a  relatively 
harmless  product  for  those  who  trade  it as  it should  be  traded—as  a 
bet.  Dynamic  hedging  is to be  avoided  with  these  situations. 

This  distinction  between  payoff  types  is  ever  present  in  structures. 
There  are  bet  options  that  are  American  and  pay  “if  touched”  and  bet  op- 
tions  that  pay  if some  condition  is met  on  expiration.  They  also  provide  us 
with  good  grounds  for  the  transition  to barriers. 

Example—European:  A  three-year  dollar  denominated  note  pays  7% 
every  coupon  date  when  dollar-yen  is above  100  and  4%  otherwise.  This 
note  could  be constructed  with  a  regular  note  of the  same  maturity  and 
a  strip  of digital  call  options  struck  at  100  expiring  on  the  coupon  dates. 

Example—American:  The  same  note  as  before  except  that  it  pays  8% 
unless  the  yen  trades  at  110  at some  point  during  its  three-year  life.

Step  3.  BARRIERS 

- 

@ A barrier  is  a  price  level  in  the  market  (called  a  trigger)  that,  when 

~  reached,  markedly  alters  the  payoff  of the  structure.  | 

Perhaps  the  most  entertaining  aspect  of option  trading  is the  barrier.  Many 
traders  have  witnessed  “trigger”  prices  being  crossed  with  heavy  heart- 
beat.  They  are  also  interesting  for  the  researcher  because  they  call  on a col- 
orful  branch  of mathematics  (probability  theory). 

The  trader  must  ask  whether  the  structure  has  a  barrier  terminating  it 
(knock-out)  or  initiating  it.  Figure  2.5  shows  an  asset  price  crossing  the  up 
barrier. 

A high  barrier  (or up barrier)  is a barrier  located  above  the  present  spot. 
A low  barrier  (or down  barrier)  is a barrier  located  below  the  spot. 

Strep  4.  DIMENSION  OF  THE  STRUCTURE 
AND  THE  NUMBER  OF  ASSETS 

 \  The  dimension  of the  structure  is 1 +  the  number  of variables  affecting 

its  value  (one  is for  time). | 

As  shown  in  the  tutorial  introduction  to  the  random  walk  in Module  A, the 
conventional  “vanilla”  option  has  two  dimensions:  the  asset  and  time.  With 
two  pieces  of information:  the  asset  price  (y axis)  and  the  time  (x axis),  the 
information  can  be  represented  in  a  two-dimensional  graph.  The  market 
could  be  illustrated  by the  classical  random  walk  of  a  drunk  man  down 
Madison  avenue. 

44 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

When  more  than  one variable  is  involved  in  the  structure,  traders  need 

to  deal  with  the  notions  of correlation  and  independence. 

There  are  many  types  of higher  dimensional  struc  tures:  In  the  “hard”  3D 
structure,  there  is  more  than  one  strike  price;  ina‘ ‘soft’ 3D  structure  (e.g.,a 
convertible),  the  level  of interest  rates  matters  in  the  construction  itself. 

An  American  currency  option  is  particularly  sensitive  to  interest  rates 

and  the  curve.  It is  therefore  considered  a  structure  of  higher  dimension. 

The  custom  of derivatives  traders  to  hedge  themselves  in  liquid  instru- 
ments  causes  all  the  instruments  to  become  multiasset  (higher  dimension 
by construction). 

@  A  multiasset  structure  by  construction  is  one  that  results  from  the 
hedge  of an  illiquid  structure  with  liquid  options  Whe nan  option  inan 
illiquid  market  is  hedged  with  a  “similar”  option  in  a  liquid  one,  the 

This  increase  in  the  dimension  of  the  structure  is generally  necessary  with 
strange  instruments. 

Example—Multiasset  3D  by  Construction: 
A  trade®  at  a  bank  sold  to  a 
customer  (oh  no!)  a DEM-AUD  (Deutsche  mark-Australian  dollar)  cross 
option.  The  option  is  clearly  hedgeable  with’  the  underlying  asset  (the 
DEM-AUD  spot  and  forward  markets).  However,  the  spot  market  in  that 
country  is  not  very  liquid.  So  the  trader  breaks  up  the  structure  into  two 
units:  USD-DEM  and  AUD-USD.  He  will  hedge  his  spot  and  forward  ex- 
posure  there,  thus  getting  into  some  first  order  (delta)  neutrality.  The 
reader  will  find  in  Module  C,  the  meaning  of  the  orderings  betw  cen  two 
currencies  or  between  a  currency  and  the  numeraire  “base  currency.” 

The  trader,  being  wise,  requires  further  hedging  to  reduce  the 
volatility  risks  of  the  book.  He  therefore  buys  some  of  the  volatility  in 
USD-DEM  and  some  in  AUD-USD,  as  these  are  liquid  in  the  market. 
(The  proportion  will  be  analyzed  later.)  He  will  now  have  a  multiasset 
portfolio,  with  the  following  prices:  USD-DEM  and  AUD-USD,  whereas 
previously  he  only  had  one  of  them  to  consider.  The  concept  is  hard  to 
understand  but  the  two  different  assets  will  yield  three  different  volatil- 
ities  (one  for  each  resulting  pair)  linked  together  by  two  correlations. 

Example—Multiasset  4D  by Design: 
The  trader  in  the  earlier  example 
received  a  phone  call  with  bad  news  and,  as  a  result,  had  to  trade  a  Greek 
Drachma-Australian  dollar  large  option  position  (symbol  GDR-AUD). 
He  broke  up  the  volatility  risk  into  liquid  subcomponents:  GDR-DEM, 
USD-DEM,  AUD-USD  and  traded  each  one  of those  against  it (3 assets  + 
time  =  4 dimensions).

‘Option  Wizard:  How  to  Get  in Trouble  Hedging 

Financial  markets  history  is  littered  with  stories  of traders  who  bought  an  in- 
strument  and  tried  to  reduce  the  risks  by  selling  a  “highly  correlated”  one 
against  it, only  to  discover  that  they  doubled  their  risks.  The  trader  after  seeing 
on  the  screen  the  price  of one  of the  two  instruments  go  down  (the  one  he  is 
long,  of course)  and  the  other  go  up  (the  one  he  is short)  will  blame  markets  for 
not  being  well  behaved. 

A deeper  analysis  would  show  that,  typically,  some  of the  instruments  that 
are  easy  to  buy  against  easy-to-sell  “correlated  siblings”  are  invitations  for 
trouble.  They  act  as  a  trap  that  will  attract  many  hedgers  and  arbitrage  traders 
then  force  them  into  noisy  liquidations.  This  effect  can  lead  to  disastrous  re- 
sults  on  gullible  managers  using  such  apparatus  as  the  “value  at  risk.” 

Swaps  would  be  easy  instruments  to 
Example—Swaps  and  Bonds: 
trade,  except  that  the  exact  maturity  and  coupon  are  never  as  liquid  as 
operators  wish.  These  swaps  will  need  to  be  matched,  alternatively, 
with  other  swaps  that,  with  a  different  coupon,  will  trade  on  their  own. 
When  hedged  with  strip  (Eurodollar  futures  added  up  in  a  weighted 
manner),  swaps  will  become  sensitive  to  the  correlation  between  the 
components  . 

STEP  5.  ORDER  OF  THE  OPTIONS 

@ | Higher  order  options  refer  to  contingent  options.  An  option  on  another 
Option  is a  second-order  option.  An  option  on  a  second  order  option  is a 
third-order  option,  and  so  on. 

Higher  order  options  are  becoming  more  and  more  common  with  financial 
products.  Many  options,  called  extendible,  have  built  into  them  a  renewal  of 
the  contract  at  a  certain  price.  They  can  be  extended,  say  five  times,  for  a 
predetermined  $1  each.  However,  should  the  option  not  be  renewed  at  any 
extension  period,  the  entire  structure  expires  worthless  or  the  underlying 
asset  is delivered  at  the  strike  price  like  a  regular  delivery. 

As  the  trader  goes  into  higher  and  higher  orders,  he  becomes  con- 
“fronted  with  the  contingency  of a  contingency.  Positions  will  move  further 
out-of-the-money,  and  the  risks  will  become  less  and  less  linear.  The  com- 
pounding  of a  probability  with  a  second-order  option  reduces  the  certainty 
of  the  payoff  and  will  therefore  require  less  hedge  than  a  regular  option. 
The  delta  will  be  lower  but  very  unstable,  to  the  point  of carrying  little  risk 

46 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

disclosure.  Delta  and  fist-order  Greeks  will  be less  meaningful  and  their  in- 
stability  will  require  the  risk  manager  to  have  recourse  to  higher  order  de- 
rivatives,  such  as  the  third  and  fourth  moment,  to  assess  the  portfolio  risks. 

A  common  use  of  compound  options  is  with  warrant  issues. 
Example: 
The  price of the  warrant  is set  at some  point,  say  at $2, but  the  investor  has 
a  few  hours  or  days  to  make  up  his  mind  as  to  whether  he  wants  to  buy 
into  it or  not.  The  option  dealer  is thus  short  an  option  on  the  warrant. 

Step  6.  PATH  DEPENDENCE 

@ \ Path-independent  options  are  options  whose  payoff  depends  exclu- 
sively  on  the  events  upon  expiration,  regardless  of  the  route  taken.  A 
path-dependent  option  depends,  in  addition  to  the  final  price,  on  at 
least  one  price  in the  path  taken  to  get there. ) 

A  European  option’s  price  for  the  buyer  depends  exclusively  on  the  final 
price.  If someone  buys  the  104  calls,  he  stands  to  benefit  if the  security  gets 
above  104  upon  expiration;  otherwise,  he would  lose  histpremium.  How  the 
spot  gets  to  that  point  is  theoretically  irrelevant.  The  option  is  therefore 
said  to be path-independent.  As  will  be shown,  such  path independence  is a 
myth.  Every security  is path-dependent  for  a person,  including  an  end  user, 
who  has  a marked-to-market  and  the  power  of a  decision  throughout  its  life. 

Figure  2.6  shows  two  paths  leading  to  the  same  terminal  value. 

__~  There  are  two types  of path  dependent  categories:  the  soft  and  the  hard 
“path dependent  options. 

ie  sy  vy  04 

@  The  soft-path-dependent  option  (also  called  “memoryless  path  depen- 
dent)  depends  on  one  piece  of  information.  The  hard-path-dependent 
option  (also  called  “path-dependent  with  strong  memory”)  will  present 

Figure  2.6  Two  paths  leading  to  the  same  terminal  value.

a  payoff  that  is entirely  dependent  on  the  path taken  during  some  inter- 
val.  It  is  therefore  truly  path-dependent  because  all  the  roads  do  not 
lead  to  Rome  in  the  same  fashion. 

AA barrier option  is a  soft-path-dependent  option  because  at  any  time  it de- 

ae on  whether  the asset traded  at  or  pes the  barrier or  not. 

pends on one Bes of information  raid fe path:  the  extremum.  What  suc- 
cession  of  events  lead  there  is  not  relevant  (the  lookback  options  are 
somewhat  related  to  the  barriers  in  the  sense  that  they  can  be  decomposed 
into_series  of knock-in  and  knock-out  options). 

Options  on  averages  are  hard-path-dependent.  Every  observation  will 
count  and  the  value  will  depend  on  every  step  taken  by the  security.)  Den- 
sity,  however,  affects  how  strong  the  memory  is,  and  what  consfitutes  a 
path  dependence.(A  dense path-dependent  option  cares  about  every  piece 
of information,  whereas  a  lighter  one  cares  about  infrequent  ones.) 

Example:  (An Asian  option  will  present  dense  path-dependent  fea- 
tures  if it is based  on  hourly  prices  and  light  features  if the  sampling  is 
monthly  or  quarterly.)The  effect  this  has  on  the  final  hedging  will  be 
discussed  later  in thé  book.

Market  Making  and  Market  Using 

Anybody  can  buy and  sell. 

James  C.  Powers 

The  goal  for  this  chapter  is  to  describe  the  modus  operandi  of  the  various 
participants  in  the  market  (see  Figure  3.1). 

Pit  traders’  jargon  identifies  a  three-tier  classification  of the  market  par- 

ticipants:  the  local,  the  paper,  and  the  arb. 

@  The  local  is  a  floor  market  maker.  A  pure  price-sensitive  lot,  locals  are 
entirely  liquidity  driven  in  their  trades.  They  are  tke  party  benefiting 
from  the  time  and  space  advantage. 

™@  Paper  means  end  customers.  Their  name  is a  reminder  that  in the  past  a 
runner  would  carry  their  order  (literally  running)  through  the  floor  of 
the  exchange  written  on  a  piece  of distinctive  paper.  Locals  are  always 
eager  to  trade  with  paper  because  they  feel  that  they  have  the  edge.  A 
local  who  wants  to  trade  with  other  locals  generally  needs  to  disguise 
his  order  to  make  it look  like  paper. 

@  Arbs  are  arbitrageurs  or  a  mixture  between  market  makers  and  end 
users.  They  are  the  ones  carrying  the  infamous  program  trading  in  the 
SP500  (a cash-future  arbitrage)  and  transfer  liquidity  from  one  market 
to  another  (for a  small  fee,  of course). 

BooK  RUNNERS  VERSUS  PRICE  TAKERS 

post  some  price  at which  they  are  willing  to  ae (their  bid)  and  some  price 
at  which  they  would  be  consenting  sellers  (the  offer).  They  consider  that 
they can  benefit  from  positive  expected  returns,  the  fair  odds,  because  they 
hope to earn a large part of the  difference  between  the  middle  of the  market 
and  the bid  or  offer,  thus  achieving  transaction  positivity  (while  most  other

narket  users, a  function  diametrically  opposed  to  that 
of Pace aesraanict maker  acts  as  a  liquidity  conduit,  standing  be- 
tween  end  users,  for  a  compensation.  The  principal  difference  in  attitude 
between  a  book  runner  and  an  investor  lies  in  their  relative  price  sensitiv- 
ity.  A market  maker’s  willingness  to  take  on  a  position  will  increase  as  the 
price  becomes  more  attractive;  not  so  for  the  market  user  (except  in  the 
event  of liquidity  holes).  A market  maker  reflecting  a  strong  view  in  all  of 
his  trades  would  ultimately  bankrupt  his  firm  as  the  volume  of his  transac- 
tions  would  then  become  one-sided  and  cause  an  extravagant  accumulation 
of positions. 

Most  of  the  academic  literature  distinguishes  between  “upstairs”  and 
floor  traders.  “Upstairs”  traders  refers  to  price  takers.  Nowadays  market 
makers  in  complex  products  are located  “upstairs.” 

No  operator  is  entirely  a  market  maker  (that  is  always  devoid  of  opin- 
ion)  and  no  investor  is entirely  price  insensitive.  Most  investors  try to  min- 
imize  transaction  costs,  sometimes  even  earn  the  spread  by working  limit 

50 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

orders.  Effective  market  makers  “lean”  on  a  position,  that  is  try  to  keep  a 
core  long  or  short  position  and  skew  their  prices.  Typically  their  bias  is  de- 
fensive.  In  a  trending  bull  market,  book  runners  intuitively  fear  their  get- 
ting  short  from  the  overabundance  of buy orders  and  reflect  the  preference 
for  a  long position  by shading  their  bids  and  offers  upward  (and  conversely 
in  a  bear  market).  Similarly  price  takers  might  delay  entering  a  trade  as  the 
price  becomes  less  attractive  although  occasionally  they  take  an  opposite 
position  than  intended  as a sole  result  of  a  price  adjustment.  Sometimes 
price  sensitivity  may  be negative:  An  operator  with a belief  in trends  might 
be  enticed  to buy when  prices  get higher  or  sell  when  prices  drop. 

Finally  the  difference  between  a  market  maker  and  a  market  user  lies  in 
that  the  former  needs  to be  defensive  whereas  the  latter  has  the  freedom  to 
be  aggressive.

COMMODITIZED  AND  NONSTANDARDIZED  PRODUCTS 

There  are  two  types  of  markets:  “commoditized”  products  that  have  en- 
tered  their  liquid  phase  and  “nonstandardized”  ones  where  the  instru- 
ments  are  still  immature  and  new  (see  Figure  3.2).  Comanoditized  products 
exhibit  a high volume  and  high degree  of liquidity  but  relatively  small  edge, 
a  narrow  bid-to-offer  spread,  and  a  general  overcrowding  of  talent.  Their 
advantage  principally  is that  the  market  makers  can  make  up for the narrow 
spread  with  the  high volume—“a  fast  nickel  is better  than  a  slow  dollar,”  as 
the  adage  goes.  They  are  so  competitive  that  they  require  a  certain  sophisti- 
cation  in addition  to  market  sense,  a notion  that  most  traders  use  and  under- 
stand  but  that  nobody  has  been  able  to  define  accurately. 

Commoditized  products  have  standard  agreements  in  place,  eliminate 
most  surprises,  and  typically  trade  between  dealers  where  constant  match- 
ing of risks  takes  place.  The  existence  of an  interbank  market  is the  test  of 
standardization.  They  rank  from  the  very  simple  cash  products  to  some 
lower  forms  of  exotic  options  (e.g.,  single  barrier  knock-outs).  Commodi- 
tized  products  are  price  sensitive,  but  the  volume  is  high  and  traders  can 
fine-tune  their  portfolios  in a  way  to  capture  their  edge. 

Nonstandardized  products,  like  structures,  have  payoffs  that  are  pecu- 
liar  to  the  instrument  itself  and  require  special  pricing  capabilities,  such  as 
an  on-staff  mathematician.  In  contrast,  the  commoditized  products  can  be 
priced  and  managed  with  the  aid  of commercially  available  software  prod- 
ucts  (generally  faulty).  It  can  become  necessary  to  design  programs  for 
every  trade,  with  a  higher  incidence  of  pricing  “bugs.”  An  option  with  a 
payoff attached  to  several  assets,  with  a barrier  that  is reset  six  times  and  an 
uncertain  expiration  date  (it can  be  extended)  will  not  be  easily  booked  in a 
commercial  risk  management  system.  It  will  require  a  special  computer 
subroutine  to  track  its  “Greeks.”

The  real  difference  between  commoditized  and  nonstandard  products 
is  that  one  type  is  tailor-made,  with  a  high  price  tag  attached  to  it  and 
smaller  traffic,  while  the  other  has  the  features  of  a  discount  store  with 
standard  sizes  and  prices,  but  a  higher  volume.  Table  3.1  lists  these  and 
other  major  differences.  All  successful  nonstandard  products  become  com- 
moditized.  When  many  of  us  started  trading  options,  these  were  mostly 
nonstandard  but  the  markets  moved  rapidly  from  one  category  to  the  other.

Thanks  to  the  competition,  these  products  represent  less 
rewards  as  they  are  usually  more  liquid  and  require  no  sophisticated  risk 
management  tools.  However,  they  allow  the  traders  to  completely  offset 
the  risk  of their  trades  and  avoid  the  necessity  of warehousing  contracts  for 
any  length  of time.  A  cash  trader  will  hold  a  position  over  his  horizon  by 
choice  only.

Option  Wizard:  Trader  Decay 

3 

As  products  increase  in  sophistication,  traders  become  rapidly  obsolete.  This  is 
becoming  significant  in  most  markets. 

Unlike  practitioners  of  most  professions,  traders  are  not  given  time  (or  do 
not  give  themselves  enough  time)  to  adapt  to  the  new  products  or  learn  new 
techniques.  Traders  are  constantly  under  profitability  pressures  that  force  them 
to  focus  on  “producing”  lest  they  join  the  ranks  of  laid-off  Wall  Streeters.  The 
trader  finds  himself  a  niche  and  milks  it until  its  (and  his)  termination. 

In  addition,  holding  a  trading  position  requires  such  an  intellectual  com- 
mitment  that  the  trader  may  feel  consumed  to  the  point  that  other  functions  of 
the  mind  slow  down.  One  comparison  is the  RAM  of a  personal  computer  that 
is heavily  burdened  by a  program  running  in  the  background. 

Firms  on  Wall  Street  that  in  the  past  invested  in  employee  development 
have  been  squeezed  into  “cleanups.”  A trader  is generally  “as  good  as  his  last 
trade.” 

This  explains  partly  the  segregation  between  commoditized  products  and 
complex  derivatives  in  most  firms.  Newcomers  present  inexpensive  sophistica- 
tion  but  no  trading  experience.  They,  in  turn  will  rapidly  decay  and  will  be  re- 
placed  by the  new  PhD  crop. 

S, a  thoughtful  trader  with  some  intellectual  curiosity,  once  told  the  author 
about  his  dilemma:  taking  a  learning  sabbatical  and  giving  up  his  present  job 
with  the  possibility  of not  being  able  to  return,  or  remaining  on  the  job and  be- 
coming  richer  but  obsolete.

Traders  hedging  a  forward  or  a  swap 
Linear  (or quasi-linear)  Derivatives. 
become  subjected  to  maturity  mismatches.  Their  hedge  ratios,  however,  do 
not  change  with  time  and  pricing  levels.  They  rarely  incur  transformation 
in hedging  parameters  (assuming  no  meaningful  convexity  differences)  ex- 
cept  for  some  extrinsic  ones  (e.g.,  correlation  coefficients).  A swap  trader  on 
a  deserted  island  can  always  summarize  his  position  (but  not  his  P/L), 
whereas  an  option  trader  needs  to  check  volatility,  spot,  interest  rates,  and 
so  on  to  know  his. 

The  sensitivity  of these  portfolios  remains  constant  across  time  or  vari- 
ation  in  the  market  prices.  The  fact  that  the  hedges  might  not  work  in  con- 
sequence  to  yield  curve  shifts  or  other  phenomena  does  not  necessarily 
make  these  derivatives  nonlinear.  The  trading  complexities  reside  in  the 
difficulties  in  gauging  the  hedge  ratios  and  the  relative  volatilities  and  co- 
variances  of the  different  maturities.  In  addition,  swaps  are  an  area  where 
the  accuracy  of the  pricing  and  interpolation  are  evident.

income  securities  with  high  convexity  that  change  in  sensitivity  with  the 
passage  of time  or  with  market  levels  (see  Chapter  11  for  a  discussion). 

Book  running  in  these  derivatives  is  less  accommodating  than  that  in 
cash  or  linear  products:  The  trader  is ready  to warehouse  a  trade  for  a  given 
amount  of time,  generally  until  expiration,  against  a  fee.  Because  the  hedge 
ratios  and  the  particularities  of the  instruments  change  according  to  time 
or  market  movement,  the  book  runner  needs  to  engage  in dynamic  manage- 
ment  of the  position.  Novice  option  traders  are  taught  that  there  is only one 
way  to  hedge  the  sale  of an  option:  by buying  back  the  same  one.  The  inher- 
ent  instability  of  derivative  positions  and  their  dependence  on  time  and 
market  levels  makes  it  clearly  impossible  to  define  oneself  as  completely 
“flat,”  except  when  the  book  is empty  of trades,  a  rare  occurrence. 

Profitability 

Derivatives  market  making  in  both  standard  and  nonstandard  products  is 
an  attractive  occupation  because  although  every  option  is relatively  illiquid, 
the  market  as  a  whole  for  the  Greeks  is very  liquid.  Unlike  a market  maker 
in  an  illiquid  commodity  that  is uncorrelated  to  a  more  liquid  one,  the  op- 
tion  market  maker  can  easily  find  cheap  alternative  hedges. 

The  compensation  for  traders  comes  from  offsetting  the  Greek  risks 
(delta,  vega,  gamma)  more  rapidly  than  predicted.  That  privilege  arises  be- 
cause  market  makers  have  decided  to  run  a  book  and  incur  the  costs  associ- 
ated  with  the  book  management.  The  barriers  to  entry  become  their  running 
the  book  as  an  ongoing  business.  Option  locals  who  warehouse  strike  risks 
can  easily  find  ways  to  reduce  the  variance  of  the  portfolio  with  combina- 
tions  of available  options.

PROPRIETARY  DEPARTMENTS 

The  distinction  between  market  makers  and  customers  exists  within  most 
trading  firms  and  banks.  The  firms  usually  benefit  from  the  “franchises” 
or  “customer  flows,”  two  buzzwords  connected  with  the  book-running 
function  that  represent  its  original  mission  of  trying  to  service  the  cus- 
tomer  for  a  fee  (except  that  here  the  service  becomes  the  risk  and  the  fee 
becomes  the  bid/ask  spread).  Banks  saw  the  success  of  their  hedge  fund 
customers  in  the  early  1990s  and  tried  to  replicate  their  customers’  suc- 
cesses  by creating  internal  hedge  funds.  Many  failed  and  had  to  liquidate 
rather  rapidly,  moving  their  orientation  back  toward  their  conventional 
way  of plying  the  book-running  trade. 

The  reasons  to  start  a  proprietary  function  were  obvious.  They  had  an 
overspill  of back-office  capability,  which  made  the  marginal  cost  of manu- 
facturing  trading  profits  very  low.  They  were  privy  to  very  fresh  informa- 
tion  on  order  flows  into  the  market  whether  or  not  it  turned  out  to  be 
relevant  in trading.  They also  had,  like  everybody,  excessive  capital  freed  up 
from  conventional  uses  such  as  lending  against  the  receivables  of iron  nails 
manufacturing  companies. 

Their  performance,  however,  did  not  match  expectafions  for  the  follow- 
ing  reasons:  They  had a different  utility  curve  than  the  funds,  their  execu- 
tives  and  managers  were  operating  under  a  different  utility  function  than 
the  fund  managers;  and  they had  different  expected  returns  (the funds  were 
riskier  traders).  The  funds  managers  had  a  collection  of funds  that  each  pre- 
sented  the  features  of an  option.  Bank  managers  had  one  option  on a collec- 
tion  of  generally  uncorrelated  assets.  According  to  the  Basket  Rule  (to  be 
discussed  later  in this  book),  the  expected  returns  from  such  a basket  would 
be  considerably  lower.  In  addition,  banks  sought  “diversification,”  some- 
thing  that  seemed  to be a good  fashionable  idea, but  that  lowered  the  price  of 
the  manager’s  option. 

Ina 

totally  random  but  “fair”  return  (the expected  profits  are  zero,  a mar- 
tingale,  or  “fair  dice”),  one  option  on  a  volatile  instrument  is more  valuable  or, 
at worst,  equal  to a  portfolio  of options.  Such  a  rule  would  apply even  if the  re- 
turns  were  not  a  martingale,  to  a  point.  It resembles  the  pricing  of an  option 
that  is more  sensitive  to  the  volatility  than  the  expected  drift  (Figure  3.3). 

A trader  with  a  “synthetic  capital”  of $10 million  (i.e., the  virtual  capital 
allocated  to him  by the bank)  has  often  more  earning  power  than  a manager 
with  a  higher  amount  of capital  under  him,  because  the  manager  will  have 
to  face  the  “diversification”—the  offsetting  returns  from  traders. 

Via 

Example:  A  trader  has  $10  million  “synthetic  capital.”  His  yearly 
“swing”  is  25%:  He  will  either  make  $2.5  million  or  lose  $2.5  million. 
His  draw,  in  addition  to  his  salary  will  contractually  specify  20%.  The 
trader  cannot  be thrown  out  before  the  termination  of the  contract.!

The  expected  returns  for  the  trader  will  increase  with  volatility. 
In comparing  the  good  trader  to  the  bad  trader,  what  determines  the 
price  of  the  option  is  the  volatility,  not  the  expected  returns  from  the 
position.  Of  course,  the  example  is  simplistic:  Bad  traders  do  not  have 
easy  access  to  capital;  one  needs  (sometimes,  but  not  always)  something 
that  remotely  resembles  a  track  record  (Figure  3.4). 

The  manager  in  a  financial  institution,  in  contrast,  runs  a  large 
group  of traders.  He  is paid  10%  of a  much  larger  pie: he will  hence  have 
the  illusion  of  partaking  of  a  larger  upside.  Wrong.  The  net  sum  of 
traders,  particularly  if they are  not  proficient,  will  be worth  less  than  the 
P/L  of  one  person.  What  is  the  solution?  Avoid  diversification  at  all 
costs.  Hire  one  volatile  trader,  bad  or  good  (the  distinction  is of small

relevance).  If needs  be, make  sure  all  the  traders  carry  the  same  position, 
without  anyone  offsetting  the  other.  It is quite  dispiriting  for  a manager 
to  see  traders  carry  positions  on  opposite  sides  of the  market:  While  one 
of them  will  be  profitable  and  would  buy a new  car,  the  net  will  lock  ina 
loss  because  of  hedging  costs.  A  firm  cannot  ask  its  traders  to  pay  for 
their  losses  unless  they  are  losing  back  some  of their  profits.  A  deep-in- 
the-money  option  resembles  a  future:  A trader  with  profits  loses  the  op- 
tionality  since  his  compensation  would  decrease  with  losses. 

Compare  that  with  a  fund  manager  who  has  three  independent 
funds.  He  can  draw  20%  of each  fund,  regardless  of the  outcome  of the 
others.  Unlike  the  manager  of a  trading  desk,  he  benefits  from  the  sum 
of  the  three  options.  He  can  enhance  his  returns  by being  diversified 
across  separate  funds,  perhaps  even  negatively  correlated  between  each 
one  of  them.  The  only  way  a  bank  trading  manager  could  achieve  an 
equivalent  position  would  be  to  maintain  three  jobs  simultaneously  at 
three  different  banks  with  a  percentage  payout  in each. 

This  example  shows  why  proprietary  trading  departments  ended  up  clos- 
ing down  while  fund  managers  thrived. 

Tacit  RULES  IN  MARKET  MAKING 

Market  making  in  derivatives  is subjected  to  a  host  of unwritten  rules  that 
vary  according  to  the  market  for  each  instrument.  These  rules  evolve  con- 
tinuously  as  the  market  reaches  a  semblance  of maturity.  They  are  neces- 
sary  for  dealers  to  coexist  and  correspond  to  the  needs  of  an  ambiguous 
relationship  between  them:  Dealers  are  at  once  accomplices  and  competi- 
tors;  they  need  each  other  as  trading  counterparties  but  compete  for  cus- 
tomer  business.  Generally,  if a  trade  is  too  large  for  a  dealer,  proper  risk 
management  forces  the  dealer  to split it with  the  rest  of the  market,  for a fee. 
The  need  to ensure  liquidity  and  the  adequate  spread  of information  for one 
another  (without  weakening  any  of the  parties)  leads  to  well-defined  rules 
of behavior. 

A  market  maker  in  a  cash  product,  for  example,  by asking  another  one 
for  a  price,  is giving  up  information  about  his  position  against  the  consum- 
mation  of a  trade  that  would  reduce  that  position.  The  trade-off  will  be  fur- 
ther  enforced  because  he will  now  have  an  accomplice. 

A  large  corporation  buys  500  million  British  pounds  from 
Example: 
Witibank.  The  Witibank  traders,  unwilling  to  hold  such  a  large position, 
“call  out”  for  prices,  contacting  other  dealers  for £20  million  each.  Deal- 
ers  need  to  produce  the  price  without  knowing  beforehand  whether 

Market  Making  and  Market  Using 

57 

Witibank  is a  buyer  or  a  seller.  They  would  realize  that  Witi  has  a  rela- 
tively  large  amount  to  execute  and  know  that  by getting  £20  million 
they would  be handicapped  as  the  market  might  be flooded  by the  trade 
for  a  certain  period.  However,  they  cannot  escape  their  obligation  to 
quote  Witibank  as  they would  require  the  same  favor  should  they be  on 
the  other  side  quoting  large  amounts  to  their  own  customers.  By trad- 
ing,  they  will  also  gather  a  valuable  piece  of information,  the  suspicion 
of  a  large  order  weighed  against  the  possibility  of  a  bluff.  By  trading 
with  Witibank  they will  then  become  partners  in a secret. 

Very  liquid  products  have  thus  highly  developed  rules,  down  to  how 
long  a  person  can  wait  before  the  quote  becomes  invalidated.  Also,  it is not 
acceptable  to  come  back  to  the  same  dealer  after  “passing”  (avoiding  the 
trade)  on  a  market,  to  quote  too  much  without  trading,  or  to  pass  on  a 
“choice”  market;  that  is, when  the  counterpart  shows  the  same  price  as  a bid 
and  as  an  offer. 

On  the  floor  of  the  exchanges  regulated  by  the  Commodity  Futures 
Trading  Commission,  market  making  for  futures  and  options  is  usually 
subjected  to  the  open  outcry  rules.  The  trader  needs  to continuously  refresh 
his  bid  or  offer  and  specify  a  quantity  for  which  his  market  is valid;  other- 
wise,  he  could  be  asked  to  honor  his  price  for  larger  amounts  than  his  capi- 
tal  would  allow.  Traders  have  no  obligation  to  respond  to  the  brokers  nor  to 
other  traders:  They  hawk  their  wares  to  generate  business  and  create  adver- 
tising  for  themselves. 

In  the  “upstairs”  markets,  there  are  subdivisions  that  depend  on  the 
level  of liquidity  of the  product.  The  more  established  and  liquid  ones,  such 
as  short-term  currency  options,  trade  like  cash,  with  mature  rules  and  tacit 
obligations  between  dealers;  whereas  structured  notes  are  not  an  interbank 
market  and  have  no  clear  rules.  A trader  has  neither  the  obligation—nor  the 
need—to  quote  them  to  another  dealer. 

MARKET  MAKING  AND  THE  PRICE  FOR  IMMEDIACY 

A  theory  by Sanford  Grossman  and  Merton  Miller*  states  that  the  market 
maker  function  is  to  provide  the  price  for  immediacy.  The  price  taker  pays 
the  market  maker  in  order  not  to  have  to  wait  and  incur  the  risks  that  rise 
with  the  square  root  of time.  The  price  for  immediacy  is then  reached  as  an 
equilibrium  between  buyers  and  suppliers  of immediacy. 

Started  by Garman  in  1976,  Market  Microstructure  is still  a young  branch 
of financial  theory.  Most  of its  motivations  are  grounded  on  the  awareness 
that  prices  do not  reach  equilibrium  immediately  in a big Walrassian  auction 
meeting.  Customers  need  market  makers  to  fill  gaps  arising  from  imperfect 

58 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

synchronization  between  buyers  and  sellers.  Bid /offer  spreads  will  then 
depend  on  competition  between  market  makers.*  Some  of  the  theories  de- 
veloped  will  be  explored  later  in  the  book. 

MarkKET  MAKING  AND 
AUTOCORRELATION  OF  PRICE  CHANGES 

.  Pell a  positive  autocorrelation  of a  price  change  means  that  an  up-move 
‘ is more  likely  than  not  to  be  followed  by an  up-move  and  a  down-move  by a 
down-move.  A negative  autocorrelation  means  the  opposite:  The  following 
move  is more  likely  to  be  of the opposite  sign  than  the  previous  one. 

he  horizon  of such  effect  also  needs  to  be  defined.  A  first-order  auto- 
hee means  that  the  effect  is immediately  a  function  of the  move  that 
just  happened.  In  simple  terms,  a  higher  order  one  means  that  there  might 
be  a  lag before  such  an  effect  is felt. 

Many  studies  report  the  existence  a  first-order  negative  autocorrelation 
of price  changes.  Such  autocorrelation  of prices  reflects  the  “positive  edge” 
of market  makers.*  Most  studies  report  an  autocorrelation  for  price  changes 
when  the  observations  are  very  frequent,  as  well  as  the  vanishing  of the  cor- 
relation  when  observations  are  separated  by more  than  a  few  minutes.  The 
most  recent,  Guillaume  et  al.  (1995)  reports  a correlation  between  prices  in 
the  dollar/DM  currency  pair  extremely  significant  up  to  four  minutes  for 
data  observed  between  1987  and  1993.  Figure  3.5  shows  the  correlation  of 
the  changes  (the  logs  of  the  difference)  and  the  rapidity  with  which  such 
autocorrelation  washes  out.  Because  the  4-minute  price  volatility  is  lower 
than  the  bid/offer  spread,  it becomes  conceivable  that  only  a  market  maker 
can  capture  such  advantage.  An  average  dollar/DM  trader  will  execute  a 
trade  every  18  seconds”  during  liquid  times,  which  falls  within  the  zone  of 
high negative  autocorrelation. 

This  first-order  autocorrelation  of prices  (i.e.,  a short-term  memory  for 
events  preceding  it) does  not  force  us  to  depart  from  the  notion  of  a  “fair 
dice,”  or  martingale,  once  we  translate  the  difference  into  some  positive 
transaction  costs  for  a market  maker.  Only  a  market  maker  can  benefit  from 
a  submartingale  (that  is a  favorable  dice)  and  in  a  limited  way  at  that. 

The  issue  of autocorrelation  of returns  will  be  further  discussed  in  the 

context  of the  variance  ratios  in Chapter  6. 

MarkET  MAKING  AND  THE  ILLUSION  OF  PROFITABILITY 

Market  making  in complex  products  can  show  immediate  rewards  and  future 
thorns.  Mostly  profits  are  shown  after  the  trade  because  the  mark-to-model 
process  generally  implemented  derives  security  prices  off  a  mid-market.

Traders  usually  find  a  fair  value  and  mark  the  derivative  up,  then  recognize 
most  or  all  of the  difference  between  the  fair  value  and  the  selling  price  as  a 
profit.  This  method  does  not  allow  for  the  future  costs  incurred  in the  man- 
agement  of an  option  book.  The  more  complex  the  security,  the  more  subse- 
quent  dynamic  hedging  will  be required,  and  that  in more  than  one  market  (a 
cross-currency  structured  note  needs  to  be  readjusted  in  the  Euro-Strips  of 
both  currencies  and  in  options  on  the  cross  currency,  options  need  to  be 
rolled  as  they  come  close  to  expiration,  etc.).  Heavy  slippage  will  be  incurred 
when  the  position  attains  some  large  size.  All  this  would  eat  up  the  initial 
profit,  but  would  often  be  concealed  from  the  trader  who  receives  a  steady 
flow  of such  profit-booking  trades.  It would  be  difficult  for  the  trader  to  es- 
pouse  a  more  aggressive  stance  and  reduce  transaction  costs  by observing  the 
different  behavior  of  the  multifaceted  subcomponents:  Market  makers  are 
crippled  by the  size  of their  positions  in relation  to  their  appetite  for  risk. 

Complex  derivatives  usually  come  in batches  causing  either  the  initial 
firm  or  the  competitors  to  sell  more  of a  successful  product.  Ideas  that  sell 
are  rapidly  imitated,  and  customers  buy  them  with  the  comfort  that  oth- 
ers  are  doing  the  same.  That  bandwagon  makes  all the  incremental  hedges 
of the  product  more  costly  because  their  liquidity  dries  up.  A costly  exam- 
ple is the  Mexican  peso  range  notes  that  make  the  issuing  bank  short  out- 
of-the-money  puts  on  the  currency.  Their  demand  was  widespread  before

Option  Wizard:  Market  Making  and  the  Burnout  of Traders 

Option  book  runners  constantly  want  to  retire  into  proprietary  trading  depart- 
ments.  The  strains  of  a  position  can  be  unrelenting,  particularly  when  the 
traders  become  driven  by their  books;  they  then  manage  positions  so  defen- 
sively  as  to  pay  the  price  of  liquidity  for  each  trade.  Typically,  market  makers 
are  given  structures  by their  salesforce  and  asked  to  manage  the  risk  and  pro- 
tect  the  “profits.”  In  distinguishing  between  primary  and  secondary  trades 
(the  first  being  a  trade  that  corresponds  to  the  initiation  of a  position,  the  sec- 
ond  a  defensive,  dynamic  hedge),  accelerating  the  number  of  trades  of  the 
second  kind  generally  causes  both  fatigue  and  an  erosion  of  profits.  The  un- 
predictability  of the  results,  added  to  the  rarity  of a  vacation  (usually  heavy  in 
long-distance  calls)  causes  the  eventual  combat  fatigue. 

While  a  hedge  fund  manager  can  exit  all  his  positions  with  one  phone  call, 
the  option  book  runner  can  only  put  Novocain™  on  the  wound;  uprooting  the 
problem  > wapossible.  Personal  stress  usually  results  from  the  trader’s  inability 
to  set  his  pace:  the  difference  between  the  hunter  and  the  prey.  Most  traders 
are  hunter  types,  possessing  an  aggressive  streak  that  is  hardly  compatible 
with  the  behavior  of a  prey. 

= 

Exchange  traders  usually  do  not  suffer  the  same  fate  because  they  have  a 
better  control  over  their  inventory  and  the  small  number  of expirations  in  their 
books.  It is not  uncommon  to  see  exchange  traders  completely  liquidating  their 
book  before  a  telephone-free  trekking  trip to  Nepal. 

Another  advantage  to  exchange  traders  is  their  freedom  to  make  markets 
(some  exchanges,  however,  force  them  into  a  token  obligation).  They  can 
rapidly  identify  a  regime  shift  and  widen  markets,  something  a  trader  at  an  in- 
stitution  cannot  afford  to  do  lest  the  customers  call  the  boss.  Typically,  they 
can  refrain  from  showing  one  side  of the  market  when  markets  heat  up  (as they 
did  during  the  stock  market  crashes  of  1987  and  1989). 

the  1995  devaluation  and  dealers  found  it difficult,  even  before  the  scare, 
to  repurchase  the  puts  or  hedge  in  the  synthetic  forward  without  heavy 
costs. 

ADVERSE  SELECTION,  SIGNALING,  AND  THE 
Risk  MANAGEMENT  OF  MARKET  MAKERS 

Adverse  selection  is a  condition  well  known  by insurance  companies.  They 
have  a  tendency  to  get  the  less  desirable  policies  since  a  dying  person  is 
more  likely  to buy insurance  than  a  healthy  one.  It is also  difficult  to  distin- 
guish  between  customers  since  a  sick  man  can  withhold  information  about 

Market  Making  and  Market  Using

his  health.  Likewise,  traders  have  a  tendency  of moaning  that  they  tend  to 
acquire  the  garbage  from  the  market  (bad  distribution). 

Traders  experience  another  type  of problem:  a  counterparty  who  buys 
from  them  may  have  information  they do not  have.  We  will  examine,  later  in 
the  chapter,  the  effects  such  information  can  have  on  fair-value  pre-trade 
and  fair-value  post-trade.  Such  signaling  has  been  investigated  extensively 
in  microeconomics  and  financial  theory  (see  O'Hara,  1995,  for  a  survey). 
But  unlike  an  insurance  company,  a  trader  might  find  the  signal  valuable.  A 
trader  who  traded  with  a  central  bank  will  certainly  lose  on  that  particular 
trade.  He  will,  however,  end  up  winning  if  he  uses  the  information  to 
“piggy  back”  the  central  bank. 

Many  traders  compare  market  making  to  being  short  an  option.  Typi- 
cally,  leaving  the  price  “out”  guarantees  the  trader  a  trade  if his  bid  becomes 
highest  or  his  offer  lowest  owing  to  market  moves.  Even  though  the  market 
maker’s  price  is valid  for  only  a  few  seconds,  market  makers  can  thus  be  ex- 
posed  to  being  “picked  off”  when  information  comes  out  during  that  time 
and  the  market  maker  cannot  officially  change  his  quotes. 

It is well  known  that  market  makers  lose  money  chronically  when  mar- 
kets  experience  shocks  but  produce  profits  in normal  conditions  when  they 
can  earn  the  spread  without  much  risk.  In  that  respect,  market  makers  ap- 
pear  to  be short  volatility. 

Option  Wizard:  Comparative  Lifestyles  of Traders 

X  traded  options  “upstairs”  for  10  years,  mostly  as  a  book  runner  or  arbi- 
trageur,  and  for  a  few  years  on  the  floors  of the  Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange 
in  currencies,  SP500,  and  minor  soft  commodity  contracts.  Both  positions  had 
their  advantages.  As  an  upstairs  trader,  he  kept  his  mind  occupied  and  was  able 
to  watch a variety  of markets,  but  he  had  no  flexibility  and,  owing  to  the  size  of 
his  positions,  was  saddled  with  difficult  (but  profitable)  positions  all  the  time, 
which  prevented  him  from  taking  real  vacations.  Every  day  for  him  was  like 
maneuvering  a  large  aircraft  carrier,  but  his  job was  intellectually  rewarding. 

As  a  local,  he  felt  the  exhilaration  of  freedom  but  was  physically  limited 
with  markets  and  instruments.  It  felt  like  a  blue-collar  job  but  with  a  higher 
payout.  In  addition,  he  no  longer  got  the  respect  large  traders  usually  com- 
mand:  Brokers  who  in the  past  had  toadied  up  to  him  now  hardly  gave  him  the 
time  of day—not  a  great  loss  as  he  had  matured  by then. 

The  best  lifestyle  X  ever  experienced  was  that  of  a  carefree  wind-surfing 
and  bicycling  fanatic  who  “scalped”  options  in  the  pit only  on  days  when  the 
wind  was  unaccommodating.  X  closed  his  positions  in  the  winter  and  drove 
from  Chicago  to  California.  What  was  surprising  was  that  the  sports  bum  was, 
besides,  an  excellent  pit trader.

What  considerably  mitigates  the  risks  of  a market  maker  is the  manage- 
ment  of  the  liquidity  of  the  market  available  to  book  runners.  They  typi- 
cally  have  enough  outlays  to  offset  the  risks  so  that  being  stuck  with  a 
position  for  a  long duration  becomes  exceptional. 

VALUE  TRADING  VERSUS  THE 
GREATER  FOOL  THEORY 

There  is a  running  dichotomy  among  option  traders  whether  it is preferable 
to  warehouse  a  trade  because  of  its  intrinsic  attractiveness  or  to  trade  ac- 
cording  to  other  people’s  desires.  Here  are  the  two  parties: 

1.  The  school  of value  trading  favors  only  accumulating  positions  that, 
warehoused  until  expiration,  represent  a  positive  expected  return.  The 
traders  should  be  capable  of sustaining  a  lack  of trading  for  an  extensive  pe- 
riod.  As  these  value  trades  generally  go against  the  market,  the  trader  needs 
to  have  a  certain  measure  of  indifference  to  marks-to-market  losses  (e.g., 
buying  a  “cheap”  calendar  spread  where  the  back  month  is  heavily  dis- 
counted  owing  to  structural  supply;  buying  out-of-the-money  calls  in equity 
markets  owing  to  the  strong  discount  brought  about by the  oversupply  of 
covered-writes). 

2.  The  school  of  the  greater  fool  theory  suggests  a  trading  attitude 
more  accommodative  to  the  marketplace.  It reflects  the  belief  that  traders 
are  conduits.  Value  resides  as  much  in  the  discounting  of the  final  payoff  (a 
net  payoff  of the  trade  minus  the  cost  of hedging  a  book)  as  in  the  possibil- 
ity  that  someone  may  “pay  up”  for  the  option.  A  trader  would  not  mind 
holding  an  expensive  option  provided  that  a  greater  fool  could  come  to  re- 
lieve  him  from  it.  Playing  greater  fool  is  often  indispensable  with  market 
makers  of  liquid  products  owing  to  their  large  volume  and  frequency  of 
trades.  Because  market  makers  hardly  ever  carry  trades  for  a  significant  pe- 
riod,  they  find  it  interesting  to  value  options  in  terms  of  their  extrinsic 
rather  than  their  intrinsic  value. 

his  theory  is best  described  in  Schwager’s  New  Market  Wizards  (1992), 
ere  Jeff  Yass,  an  outstanding  market  maker,  describes  his  approach  to 
ption  trading  in terms  of conditional  probability.  Somehow  “value”  is con- 
ditional  on  the  most  recent  information  rather  than  the  overall  picture.  If a 
market  operator  is given  a  position  by someone  else,  he receives  more  than  a 
position:  He  gets information,  and  that  information  would  necessarily  erad- 
icate  the  edge.  So  there  are  two  values:  (a) value  that  was  there  before  the 
trade  (prior  value)  and  (b) value  that  is conditional  on  the  trade,  which  will 
be  necessarily  higher  (if the  operator  is  short)  or  lower  (if the  operator  is 
long)  than  the  original  one  (post  value).

Table  3.2  lists  the  attributes  of the  two  methods. 

Example:  Two  option  traders  would  eventually  make  money  on  two 
diametrically  opposite  trades,  provided  they  remained  consistent  with 
their  trading  styles.  The  first  one,  a  value  trader,  would  go  against  the 
skew  in biased  assets  markets  by buying  calls  and  selling  puts  for  a 
volatility  differential  that  is not  justified  by the  real  skew  of the  distri- 
bution.  However,  he  needs  to  hedge  his  deltas  as  if  he  were  going  to 
stick  to  his  trade  until  expiration,  without  changes  in  the  process  that 
would  make  him  sell  futures  in dips  as  if volatility  were  higher. 

The  second  one  would  buy puts  and  sell  calls,  knowing  that  the  dif- 
ference  is not  warranted  by the  distribution.  He  is aware,  however,  that 
someone  along  the  way  is very  likely  to panic  at the  first  dip and  buy the 
expensive  puts  from  him  at  a  higher  price.  He  also  can  often  detect  a 
massive  anxiety  in  the  market  once  it starts  to  feel  heavy.  His  danger, 
however,  is that  warehousing  such a trade  until  expiration  would  cause 
him  to  lose  money. 

“An  expensive  option  does  not  come  alone,”  the  saying  goes.  When 
an  option  trader  sells  an  option  in  the  market,  he  would  tend  to  find 
that  the  series  would  become  more  expensive,  owing  to  the  structure  of 

64 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

imbalances.  The  best  way  for  greater  fool  traders  to  exit  is  for  them  to 
see  the  series  of options  start  softening  up. 

MONKEYS  ON  A  TYPEWRITER 

The  Statistical  Value  of  Track  Records 

There  is  an  application  of  a  mathematical  lemma  called  the  Borel-Cantelli 
Lemma’:  If one  puts an  infinite  number  of monkeys  in front  of (strongly  built) 
typewriters  and  lets  them  clap  away  (without  destroying  the  machinery), 
there  is a  certainty  that  one  of  them  will  come  out  with  an  exact  version  of 
the  Iliad.  Once  that  hero  among  monkeys  is  found,  would  any  reader  invest 
his  life’s  savings  on  a  bet  that  the  monkey  would  write  the  Odyssey  next? 

The  same  applies  to  traders.  There  is tendency  on  the  part of people  with 
a  small  knowledge  of probability  laws  to  select  proprietary  traders  and  fund 
managers  based  on  the  following  principle:  It is very  unlikely  for  a  trader  to 
be up money  ina  consistent  fashion  without  his  doing  something  right.  Track 
records,  therefore,  become  preeminent.  So  they  call  on  the  rule  of  the  likeli- 
hood  of such  a  successful  run  and  tell  themselves  that  if someone  performed 
better  than  the  rest  in  the  past  then  he  has  a  great chance  of performing  bet- 
ter  than  the  crowd  in  future  days.  I have  never  seen  anyone  count  the  mon- 
keys.  Nobody  counts  the  traders  in  the  market  to  calculate—instead  of  the 
probability  of  success—the  conditional  probability  of  successful  runs  given 
the  number  of traders  in  operation  over  a finite  market  history. 

One  of the  key properties  of probability  laws  is  that  they  are  counterin- 
tuitive.  People  look  at  a  casino  seeing  how  a  small  “edge”  translates  into 
virtually  certain  profits  and  infer  that  the  same  rules  apply  to  a  man  rolling 
the  dice.  The  sums  of random  walks  (net  profits  from  the  sum  of roulette  ta- 
bles)  act  differently  from  the  final  sum  of  a  random  walk  (a gambler’s  net 
results  at  the  end  of one  session  on  one  roulette  table). 
A modest  advantage 
on  a  sum  of random  walks  translates  into  certain  profits.  The  same  advan- 
tage  of one  roulette  table  is  generally  drowned  by the  volatility  of  the  ran- 
dom  walk  itself.  The  reader  could  test  the  difference  by generating  series  of 
tosses  on  a  spreadsheet  using  a  random  number  generator  and  looking  at 
the  discrepancies  in  the  results.  Even  with  a  small  advantage,  a  counterin- 
tuitively  high  number  of negative  runs  would  mar  the  party.  The  only  way 
to  reduce  the  frequency  of negative  runs  would  be to  increase  the  number  of 
trades  and  make  the  bets  smaller. 

One  could  think  of a  roulette  table  and  view  the  edge of a  trader  who  has 
negative  odds  with  a  system  that  gives  him  a  45%  chance  of winning.  What  is 
the  probability  of  the  person  betting  $1  being  in  the  black  after  30  throws? 
Using  the  cumulative  binomial  distribution,  he  has  at  least  a  35%  chance  of 

Market  Making  and  Market  Using 

65 

ending  up  profitable.  If the  gambler  sliced  the  bet  into  pieces  of  $0.10  and 
compensated  with  10  times  more  bets,  the  final  number  of  positive  results 
would  be 4.6%.  This  provides  a vivid  illustration  of the reasons  to use  caution 
when  considering  the  notions  of “edge”  and  “skilled  traders.”  In  a  long Wall 
Street  career,  I have  often  heard  the  adage:  “You  are  as  good  as  your  last 
trade.”  Often  the  behavior  of the  managers  of traders  is dictated  by their  lat- 
est  run.  Investors  somehow  are  not  as  easily  fooled.’ 

More  Modern  Methods  of Monitoring  Traders 

After  the  ravages  of February  1994,  people  wised  up  to  statistics  and  started 
examining  new  methods  to  distinguish  the  truly  skilled  trader  from  the 
lucky  monkey  on  a  typewriter.  Bill  Fung,’  a  consultant  to  hedge  funds,  in- 
troduced  a  nonparametric  method  of assessing  the  relative  performance  of 
a  trader  to  the  market.  It  takes  into  account  that  some  markets  trend  and 
(remember  1993)  that  some  traders  were  simply  lucky  to be long those  secu- 
rities  that  happened  to  trend.  In  addition,  he  monitors  the  transaction  fre- 
quency  to  ascertain  the  fit  between  the  trader’s  intention  and  the  actual 
events  in the  market:  The  higher  the  frequency  of trades,  the  higher  the  sta- 
tistical  significance  of the  trader’s  performance.  This  method  is  grounded 
on  the  same  awareness  of the  fit of the  distribution  as  the  one  described  in 
the  dependence  of a  dynamic  hedger  on  the  transaction  frequency.  An  op- 
tion  trader  who  frequently  rebalances  his  book  would  capture  the  true  dis- 
tribution  with  more  certainty  (for  the  better  or  the  worse)  than  his 
colleagues  who  hedges  himself  only  occasionally. 

Where  the  fund  manager  “sits”  on  a  long or  short  position,  therefore  de- 
pending  entirely  on  the  underlying  market,  the  investor  can  save  himself 
considerable  fees,  a cut  in the  expected  return,  and  some  headaches,  by buy- 
ing  a  liquid  future  on  the  commodity  itself  and  completely  bypassing  the 
fund  manager. 

The  Fair  Dice  and  the  Dubins-Savage  Optimal  Strategy 

( How aggressive  a  trader  needs  to  be  depends  highly  on  his  edge,  or  ex-  . 

pected  return  from  the  game:’ 

e  When  the  edge  is  positive,'®  (the  trader  has  a  positive  expected  re- 
turn  from  the  game,  as  is the  case  with  most  market  makers),  it is al- 
ways  best  to  take  the  minimum  amount  of risk  and  let  central  limit 
slowly  push  the  position  into  profitability.  That  is the  recommended 
method  for  market  makers  to  progressively  increase  the  stakes,  in 
proportion  to  the  accumulated  profits.(In probability  terms,  it is bet- 
ter  to  minimize  the  volatility  to  cash-in on the  drift. | 

66 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

¢  When  the  edge  is negative,’  it is best  to  be exposed  as  little  as  possi- 
ble  to  the  negative  drift.  The  operator  should  optimize  by taking  as 
much  risk  as  possible.  Betting  small  would  ensure  a  slow  and  certain 
death  by letting  central  limit catch  up  on  him. 

e  At any  rate,  when  the  trader  owns  an  option  on  his  profits  (i.e.,  gets  a 
cut  of  the  upside  without  having  to  share  into  the  downside),  as  is 
the  case  with  traders  using other  people’s  money,  it is always  optimal 
to  take  as  much  risk  as  possible.  An  option  is  worth  the  most  when

_/The ArcSine  Law  of the  P/L 

a ae 

counterintuitive  phenomenon  affecting  traders  concerns  the dis- 
tribution  of their  P/L.  One  would  think  that  in  a  fair  game  (a totally  ran- 
‘dom P/L), the most likely time  spent  in the  “black”  or  in the  “red”  would 
hover  around  6-month  per  annum.  In  reality,  the  probability  of  spend- 
ing 1 month  or  11  months  in either  is markedly  higher.  As  a matter  of fact, 
the  probability  of spending  6 months  in the  black  or  in  the  red  is the  low- 
est  of all! 

a That  striking  law  is called  the  ArcSine  law  for  a  random  walk"?  and  af- 
fects  us  in more  than  one  instance.  It also  applies  to  the  distribution  of the 
maximum  and  the  minimum  and  will  be covered  in Chapter  23. 

(Figure 3.6 shows the  expected  amount  of time  a  “fair”  trader  is expected 
to  spend  in the  black  (or the doe that  the  drift  does  not  alter  the  dis- 
tribution  until  it becomes  very  Strong.  The  arcsine  law  makes  commonly  used 
methods  of  comparing  the  cumulative  performance  of  traders  erroneous.  It 
shows  how  unjustified  most  of the  conventional  measurements  can  be. 

Risk  Management  Rules 

¢  When  judging  a  nonmarket-making  trader,  remember  that  a 

large  share  of his  profitability  is attributable  to  luck. 

The  ratio  of  luck  to  skills  decreases  with  the  transaction  fre- 
quency.  For  a  proprietary  trader,  it  is  very  high,  for  a  market 
maker  it will  be  very  low. 

In  general,  traders  become  extremely  arrogant  and  difficult  to 
manage  when  they  are  very  profitable.  A trading  manager  must 
be  able  to  face  wrongly  profitable  traders  without  being  influ- 
enced  by their  P/L. 

Do  not  use  Sharpe  ratios  with  nonlinear  products,  particularly 
options,  or  with  linear  products  traded  in  a  nonlinear  manner 
(such  as a stop  loss).!%

Arcsine  law  for  the  P/L. 

We  end  on  this  final  problem:  A trader  is given  a  stop-loss  of $100,000  in any 
given  month  (1.e.,  he  would  have  to  close  the  books  and  go  home  until  the 
end  of the  month).  Another  trader  is allowed  $200,000.  Assuming  that  both 
traded  the  same  size  in  one  uniformly  volatile  market  (constant  volatility) 
and  that  their  profits  and  losses  were  (as with  most  traders)  random,  which 
one  has  a  higher  expected  return? 

Answer:  They have  the  same  expected  profitability.  They  share  the  same 
expected  returns  but  the  trader  with  the  smaller  stop  loss  will  incur  more 
frequent  losses.  His  P/L  will  have  a  strong, positive, “skew”:  frequent small 
losses  and  infrequent  large  gains.

This  chapter  should  be  read  prior  to  studying  barrier  options. 

LIQUIDITY 

Liquidity!  in  a  market  is  defined  by the  ease  with  which  an  operator  can 
enter  and  exit  it for  a  given  block  of securities. 

If  one  were  to  summarize  what  trading  (as  opposed  to  investing)  is 
about,  the  best  answer  would  be  adequate  management  (and  understand- 
ing)  of liquidity.  Liquidity  is the  source  of everything  related  to  markets. 

Slippage  is  a  practitioner’s  measurement  for  liquidity.(It is  computed 
(for a given quantity 
to execute)  by taking the variation  between  the  av- 
erage  execution  price  and  the  initial  middle  point  of  the  bid  and  the 
offer. )Slippage is not  always  a  precise  measure  of liquidity  for  a  particu- 
lar  commodity,  but  it  provides  a  reliable  comparative  measurement  of 
liquidity  between  markets. 

Academics  offer  a  number  of measurements  for  liquidity,  mostly  using 

the  numbers  of transactions  or  the  bid /offer  spread. 

Example.  Slippage:  A fund  manager  needs  to  go long  the JPY  currency 
against  the  dollar.  The  115  calls  on  the  Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange  are 
quoted  88/92  which  means  that  the  middle  market  in theory  is at 90.  He 
would  then  assume  that  for  buying  4,000  contracts,  he  would  have  to 
pay  92  for  the  first  1,000,  93  for  the  next  1,000,  and  up  to  98  for  the  bal- 
ance  of 2,000  as  he  would  drive  the  currency  itself  higher  thanks  to  op- 
tion  traders  hedging  their  deltas.  His  weighted  average  will  then  be 
95.25  and  he  will  count  an  overall  slippage  of  5.25  ticks  for  his  execu- 
tion.  He  should  make  the  same  allowance  for  his  unwinding  the  trade, 
provided  he picks  the  same  time  of the  day. Slippage  would  be more  im- 
portant  when  the  market  gets  more  volatile  (which  is  when  the  fund 

68 

Liquidity  and  Liquidity  Holes 

69 

manager  might  find  it more  interesting  to get involved  or  to  unwind  the 
position)  or  when  the  overlapping  of time  zones  reduces  the  total  num- 
ber  of market  participants. 

Slippage  is the  principal  reason  for  leverage  hedge  fund  traders  to  limit 
the  amount  of capital  under  management.  While  their  overall  dollar  returns 
might  increase  (in  the  event  of  their  being  profitable),  the  percentage  re- 
turns  decline  accordingly. 

Ironically,  slippage  costs  often  disappear  with  large  blocks:  Many  large 
traders  can  use  their  buying  power  to  prop  up  the  market  in which  they  ac- 
cumulate  a  position.  Often  the  market  rallies  and  stabilizes  at  the  price  at 
which  the  last buy trade  was  executed.  It is in exiting  the  trade  that  slippage 
costs  will  invariably  be  incurred. 

LIQUIDITY  HOLES 

A liquidity  hole  or  a black  hole  is a  temporary  event  in  the  market  that 
suspends 
the regular  mechanics  of equilibrium  attainment.  It is an  in- 
formational  glitch  in  the  mechanism  of free  markets,  one  that  can  cause 
considerable  damage  to  firms.  In  practice,  it  can  be  seen  when  lower 
prices  bring  accelerated  supply  and  higher  prices  accelerated  demand. 

Liquidity  holes  are  attributable  to  the  way  information  initially  affects  a 
market.  Typically,  liquidity  holes  occur  when  operators  are  aware  of a  major 
piece  of  information  (an  event,  or  a  size  order  in  the  market),  but  cannot 
gauge  its  size  and  possible  impact.  Information  causes  anxiety,  conspiracy 
theory,  and  price  conflicts.  Most  often,  operators  need  to  interpret  informa- 
tion.  Markets  are  supposed  to  move  to  the  extent  of  the  difference  between 
news  and  initial  expectations  but  the  latter  are  usually  unknown  and  diffi- 
cult  to  estimate  precisely. 

political  announcement  or  the  release  of an  economic  figure  can  cre- 
ate  a  liquidity  hole  by leading  to  disruption  in  the  normal  price  determina- 
tion  process. 

When a stop-loss  is  executed,  as  in  the  following  example,  operators 
freeze  as  they  become  aware  of the  order  without  further  information  as  to 
its  magnitude.  Many  suspend  their  trading  temporarily,  thus  causing  the 
market  to  gyrate  even  further. 

Liquidity  holes  would  not  be very  dangerous  except  that  with  the  large 
open  interest  in  nonlinear  derivatives,  some  operators  have  large  contin- 
gent  orders  that  need  to  be  executed  regardless  of  the  market  makers’ 
spreads. 

Often  barrier  options  (knock-in,  knock-out)  are  to  blame  for  the  liquid- 

ity holes  and  the  intraday  volatility  that  results  from  them.

LIQUIDITY  AND  Risk  MANAGEMENT 

: 
It cannot  be  stressed  enough  that liquidity 
ment  problem(A 
substantial  part “of unforeseen losses is  due either  to  mar- 
ket  jumps  caused  by  illiquidity  or  to liquidation  costs  that  substantially 
move  the  markets  against  one’s  position.)  Liquidation  costs  tend  to  be  usu- 
ally underestimated  since  operators  ustially  “fade”  when  someone  is forced 
into  a  market  action. 

is the  most  serious  risk  ma 

Another  element  to  consider  in the  value-at-risk  (see  Module  E) method 
is  that most  simulations  exclude  the  liquidation  costs  at  the  stopping  bar- 
rier.|  The  market  is merciless  with  operators  who  start  closing  down  a  posi- 
tion,  particularly  when  the  liquidating  party  has  no  choice}  Since  forced 
liquidations  take  place  in markets  under  duress,  one  can  imagine  the  effects 
of reduced  liquidity  on  the  unwiding  of a  portfolio. 

STOP  ORDERS  AND  THE  PATH  OF  ILLIQUIDITY 

M@  Stop-loss  orders  are  instructions  to  buy  or  sell  a  given  quantity  when 
the  price  prints  on  the  screen,  unconditional  of  the  filling  price.  Buy- 
stop  orders  are  generally  higher  than  the  market  and  sell-stop  orders 
are  lower  than  the  market. 

: 

@  Limit  orders  are  instructions  to  buy or  sell  a  given  quantity  at  a  prede- 
termined  price  in  the  market.  Market  rules  guarantee  that  no  price 
would  trade  “through”  the  order  without  the  fill  being  performed. 

These  two  basic  definitions  will  be  illustrated  with  examples  later  in 

the  chapter. 

Trying  to  measure  the  markets  in  accordance  with  their  volume  is a  de- 
ceiving  enterprise.  Markets  are  not  linear  and  do  not  reach  equilibrium  in 
an  orderly  way.  Information  can  be  nefarious  as  well  as  helpful.  The  cer- 
tainty  of a  path  should  certain  conditions  be  satisfied  (a conditional  path) 
can  cause  such  gaps. 

The  mechanics  of a  stop-loss  can  shed  some  light  on  the  issue  of path- 
certainty.  Stop-losses  in  cash  products  are  buy  or  sell  orders  triggered  by 
the  market  reaching  a  certain  level.  As  such  they  resemble  trigger  options. 
A  stop-loss  in  the  SP500  to  buy  500  lots  at  624.00  will  be  triggered  by the 
broker  being  obligated  to start  buying  that  amount  at any  price  should  there 
be  an  official  print  at  that  level.  Customers  usually  leave  a  stop  in  the  mar- 
ketplace  to  protect  profits,  limit  losses,  or  sometimes  to  enter  the  market  if 
some  magic  level  is attained.  Most  trainees  are  obligated  to  leave  a  stop  for 
every  open  position  as  their  bosses  fear  their  breach  of discipline. 

Since  stop  losses  guarantee  an  order,  it  becomes  understandable 
that  some  operators  can  have  an  incentive  to  trigger  the  large  stops.  The 

Liquidity  and  Liquidity  Holes 

71 

following  example  shows  the  execution  of  a  stop-loss  in  a  relatively  less 
liquid  market. 

 Feample  A  large  European  fund  manager  gives  a  Canadian  bank  a 
stop-loss  for  $300  million  against  the  Canadian  dollar  before  going 
\ 
home,  at  noon  New  York  time.  The  Canadian  dollar  presently  trades  at 
1.38  against  the  USD  and  he  diligently  places  his  stop  at  1.3750,  a  level 
satisfactorily  far  given  the  low  volatility  of the  Canadian  currency.  The 
trader  in  possession  of the  order  knows  that  should  the  dollar  drop  he 
might  have  an  interesting  asset  in his  hands. 

Nothing  happens  for  a  few  hours  until  the  New  York  trader  notices 
that  the  Canadian  dollar  has  dropped  to  1.3780.  He  then  makes  the 
judgment  that  he  could  push  the  market  toward  the  stop,  provided  he 
runs  into  no  real  buy order  anywhere.  He  can  then  sell  a  large  block  of 
dollars  given  the  certainty  that  he  can  buy  them  back  from  his  own 
order  at  1.3750.  He  will  then  as  clumsily  as  possible  sell  $300  million, 
hoping  the  market  remains  vulnerable,  until  the  customer  gets  filled  in 
his  stop-loss.  His  aggressive  selling,  instead  of causing  more  buyers  to 
come  into  existence,  as  implied  by normal  market  dynamics,  will  make 
operators  stay  on  the  sidelines  because  of the  suspicion  of a  piece  of in- 
formation  they  do  not  have.  Figure  4.1  depicts  the  liquidity  hole  associ- 
ated  with  this  stop-loss.

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

Most  traders  on  exchanges  operate  under  the  same  principle:  that  of 
contingent  forced  large  trades.  They  do  not  need  the  exact  information:  It is 
easy  to  sense  where  the  stops  are  located  from  the  behavior  of the  brokers 
as  their  levels  get closer. 

. 

BARRIER  OPTIONS  AND  THE  LIQUIDITY  VACUUM 

Much  of the  recent  market  volatility  was  caused  by the  triggering  of barrier 
options.  As  these  are  starting  to  abound,  so  are  unexplainable  gaps  in  the 
markets  beginning  to  appear.  In  the  previous  example,  we  saw  that a large 
stop  was  a  free  option.  However,  a  stop  can  be  canceled,  or  given  to  the 
trader  too  late  for him  to be  able  to  utilize  it properly.  A trigger  option  will 
offer  none  of these  mitigating  features:  It will  be there  offered  to  the  market 
maker  far  in advance  and  by its  nature  is noncancelable. 

The  option  trader  with  a  knock-out  on  his  books  will  place  an  order  to 
unwind  his  deltas,  conditional  upon  the  termination  of an  option.  He  then 
would  not  mind  being filled  on  the  stop-loss,  as  the  small  casualty  would  be 
offset  by terminating  a liability  (the  short  option)  ahead  of  schedule.  He 
would  also  benefit  from  the  execution  of his  own  stop  erder,  if it is handled 
properly. 

Example: 
Sterling  is trading  at  1.6000  USD/GBP  (one needs  1.60  dollars 
to buy one  pound).  A trader  is short  the  1.60  Sterling  calls  for  a  3-month 
expiration  with  a  knock-out  at  1.59,  in 200  million  pounds  (equivalent  to 
US$320  million).  He  knows  that  should  1.5900  print  and  trade  in  one  or 
more  places  on  the  street  his  option  would  be  terminated.  The  option 
delta  is 78%,  and  he holds  156  million  British  pounds  against  it. 

The  option  trader  makes  a  quick  judgment  as  to  what  it would  take 
to  make  the  currency  drop  to  below  1.5900.  The  stakes  for  him  are  large 
and  he  has  an  incentive  to  trigger  1.5900.  In  addition  to  losing  his  op- 
tion,  he  could  make  some  money  in  the  process,  by playing  with  the 
stop-loss  information,  as  in  the  previous  example,  except  that  the  stop- 
loss  would  be his  own. 

He  faces  two  options.  He  could  “sell”  his  order  to  the  spot  desk 
against  .10  pips  ($200,000)  and  ask  the  desk  to  manipulate  the  markets 
for  him.  He  could  also  trigger  his  own  stop.  He  would  then  wait  to  see 
the  first  down-move  in  sterling.  Stops  are  more  easily  triggered  after 
the  Bank  of England  (also  called  the  “old  lady”)  goes  home,  in  the  New 
'  York  afternoon.  The  best  time  would  be  after  New  York  closes  and  the 
market  rotates  to  Sydney,  Australia,  and  Wellington,  New  Zealand. 
However,  the  sterling  becomes  illiquid  enough  for  that  purpose  after 
Europe’s  close. 

The  trader  would  sell  most  of his  hedge  as  the  sterling  drops:  30  at 
1.5945,  to  soften  the  market,  then  20  at  1.5930,  25  at  1.5920,  20  at  1.5910. 

Liquidity  and  Liquidity  Holes 

73 

The  current  total  is  95  (out  of  the  156  to  unwind)  and  he  could  be  in 
trouble  if the  market  rallies.  It would  perhaps  be  better  if he  put  pres- 
sure  on  the  market  with  the  remaining  65  by aggressively  offering  the 
pounds.  He  would  sell  30  at  1.5900  and  would  prefer  to  see  1.5890  trade 
to  ensure  that  the  trigger  fill  cannot  be  contested.  He  would  then  sell 
the  balance  at  1.5895  and  1.5890  by breaking  them  up  between  several 
counterparties  to  make  his  fill  incontrovertible.  Some  counterparties 
could  legally  contest  the  trigger  if there  is no  sufficient  proof of trading. 
By  consummating  the  trade  with  two  reputable  firms,  he  can  defend 
himself  against  such  allegations. 

This  influence  on  the  path of the  commodity  reduces  the  Markovian 
component  of  the  Brownian  motion:  The  process  now  has  a  memory. 
Barriers  and  stops  can  cause  the  next  price  movement  to  depend  on  the 
previous  one.  Down  moves  away  from  1.60  led  to  an  acceleration. 

A similar,  but  milder  effect  took  place  during  the  portfolio  insurance  fi- 
asco:  Locals  detected  a  large  player  whose  next  move  would  depend  on  the 
past  market  movement  and  benefited  from  it. 

ONE-Way  LIQUIDITY  TRAPS 

Many  markets,  particularly  biased  assets  (markets  subject  to  frequent  pan- 
ics),  can  present  an  asymmetrical  behavior  of prices.  Operators  experience 
a  deceiving  liquidity  on  the  way  in,  and  discover  to  their  sorrow  that  get- 
ting  out  is another  matter,  particularly  when  liquidity  holes  occur.  Traders 
experience  such  imbalance  with  out-of-the-money  puts  on  biased  assets 
that  are  in chronic  shortage  (see  Chapter  15). 

Hotes,  BLACK-SCHOLES,  AND  THE  ILLS  OF  MEMORY 

Tie principle  behind  the  arbitrage  derivation  method  in modern  option  pric- 
ing  theory  is  the  memoryless  Brownian  motion,  with  no  remembrance  of 
where  the  spot  came  from  to  the  last  price.  This  assumption  seems  to  be 
under  the  onslaught  of all  manner  of  financial  theorists  and  traders  as  new 
theories  about  some  form  of dependence  between  past  information  and  mar- 
ket  price  action  seize  the  day.*  Without  getting  into  the  chaos  theory  fad, 
there  seem  to  be  very  respectable  theories  based  on  nonlinear  dependence 
heretofore  undetected  by  the  conventional  statistical  machinery.’  Markets 
may,  after  all,  have  some  form  of memory. 

At  the  option  trader  level,  market  efficiency  does  not  appear  to  become

meaningful.|\Conditional  upon  the  market  touching  some  level,  there  will  be a  pre- 
dictavle  price action  by some  barrier  option  liquidator  that will precipitate  the  mar- 
ket in  some  known  direction») 

; 

Even  the  most  liquid  markets  display  acute  weaknesses  at  the  most  liq- 
uid  of times.  It is  not  fully  explainable  why a  market  that  moves  one  trillion 
a  day could  be  influenced  by an  order  that  represents  0.2%  of the  total  vol- 
ume.  It is also  unexplainable  why  the  experience  of liquidity  holes  has  not 
provided  immunity  as  the  market  would  use  the  holes  as  known  events  and 
would  adjust  for  their  occurrence  through  adequate  expectation. 

A fact  that  shows  why markets  have  memory  is the  noise  level  and  frenzy 
activity  that  surrounds  a  new  low  or  new  high  in  any  market,  regardless  of 
the  actual  volatility  that  led  there.  Markets  hitting  new  highs  and  new  lows 
start  moving  in gaps.  Often  stop-losses  need  to be  taken  care  of. 

LIMITS  AND  MARKET  FAILURES 

The  exchanges  seem  to  understand  that  free  markets  exhibit  failures  and 
have  stepped  in  to  suspend  trading  after  a  certain  accumulation  of events. 
The  “circuit  breakers”  in  the  SP500  (the  mother  of all HOSTS holes)  stop 
the  market  for  five  minutes  if it opens  within  a  certain  range,’ then  gradu- 
ally  establish  wider  limits  of  trading.  The  circuit  breakers  appear  to  have 
been  effective  since  the  1987  stock  market  crash,  at  least  as  a  psychological 
buffer  and  a  means  to  allow  traders  to  take  a  deep  breath  and  gauge  the 
available  information  before  the  resumption  of trading.  They  have  been  ac- 
tivated  routinely  and  appear  to  be  a  successful  experiment. 

REVERSE  SLIPPAGE 

Some  traders  are  expert  at  quietly  accumulating  securities,  causing  a  short- 
age;  then  noticing  that  the  balance  or  the  order  flow  has  shifted  to  their  ad- 
vantage,  they  can  cause  the  market  to  move  their  way.  They  incur  positive 
slippage:  ironically,  it can  be profitable  to execute  a  large order  in an  illiquid 
market  and  unprofitable  to  execute  a  smaller  one. 

Reverse  slippage  takes  place  when  the  accumulation  is  done  at  continu- 
ously  higher  prices  in  the  event  of a  buying  splurge,  and  at lower  prices  in the 
event  of a  selling  one.  Every  day, the  marks-to-market  of the  accumulating  en- 
tity  will  be  improved  during  that  phase.  Typically,  the  accumulating  party 
“digs”  the  market  at  the  end  of  the  period,  by starting  to  buy  clumsily  and 
causing  the  prices  to  move  higher  in  such  a  way  as  to  bring  stop-loss  orders 
into  play. 

However,  the  dangers  are  mostly  in  getting  out  of  the  trade.  The  trader 
cannot  engage  in  the  same  pushing  of a  market  as  he  did  during  the  position 

Liquidity  and  Liquidity  Holes 

75 

building  phase.  He  would  be  causing  his  own  collapse.  In  illiquid  markets, 
particularly  exchanges,  the  activity  will  be  detected  rapidly.  Traders  can  tell 
the  imprint  of a  source  of activity  no  matter  how  well  disguised.  They will  be 
merciless  with  a  trader  getting  out  as  they  have  an  idea  of his  size.  An  un- 
winding  party  does  not  have  the  freedom  to stop  midway  as  an  accumulating 
one  does. 

Reverse  slippage  has  been  profitable  for  fund  managers  who  created 
squeezes  large  enough  to  download a large  portion  of their  entire  inventory 
at one  price. 

LIQUIDITY  AND  TRIPLE  WITCHING  Hour 

The  mechanics  of stock  index  settlement  can  lead  to  much  abuse  by special- 
ists  and  stock  market  makers  who  can  thus  induce  a  temporary  gap  in  the 
market  and  create  a  liquidity  hole  to  their  advantage. 

Example:  A basket  arbitrageur  holds  cash  and  shorts  SP500  futures  as 
a  full  hedge.  The  contract  will  be cash  settled  (the trader  gets  a compen- 
sation  of the  difference  between  the  previous  day’s  settlement  and  the 
official  closing  price).  But  after  the  settlement,  the  trader  will  still  have 
to  close  his  long cash  position.  He  will  need  to  secure  a  bid  not  far  from 
his  settlement  price  for  the  arbitrage  to be  effective. 

The  settlement  terms  are  that  the  index  will  be  computed  off the  of- 
ficial  close  of  all  the  components.  So  the  best  solution  for  the  program 
trader  is  to  unwind  the  stocks  at  the  “market  on  close”  feature  in  the 
marketplace.  Therefore,  the  tacit  unspoken  contract  he  can  establish 
with  the  stock  specialists  is, “I do  not  care  where  I get my  fill  as  long as 
that  number  becomes  the  one  used  to  compute  the  price  of the  index.” 

The  specialists  will  then  use  their  time  and  place  advantage  to  move 
the  market  to  where  the  imbalances  are  located.  Small  imbalances 
caused  by a slight  excess  of sellers  over  buyers  would  bring  about  a  “sell 
expiration.”  The  specialist  knows  that  there  is  no  chance  in  the  small 
time  imparted  to  see  a  buyer  come  bid  better  than  him,  and  he  would 
therefore  obtain  the  stock  at  a  very  attractive  price.  The  entire  operation 
takes  place  very  quickly.  What  is  remarkable  is  that  it has  been  taking 
place  so  long without  efficient  markets  adjusting  to  the  pattern. 

PORTFOLIO  INSURANCE 

A major  illustration  of a  liquidity  hole  caused  by forced  trading  is the  port- 
folio  insurance  episode.°  It illustrates  the  case  of a  panic  in  that  a  program 
that  covered  about  75  to  100  billion  dollars,  less  than  3%  of  assets  under 

76 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

management,  could  cause  a  liquidity  hole  of such  a massive  scale.  That  port- 
folio  insurance  caused  the  crash  remains  disputable;  that  it exacerbated  the 
market  movement  is a  certainty. 

oe 

16 

Portfolio  insurance  was  initially  marketed  as  a  protection  against  ad- 
verse  market  movements  for  asset  holders  through  a  dynamic  option  repli- 
cation  technique.  The  absence  in  liquidity  in  long-term  options  justified 
the  technique  of replication  in  place  of  simple  option  buying.  Human  na- 
ture  is  such  that  a  potentially  free  lunch  appears  easier  to  sell  to  a  fund 
manager  than a real  option.  The  selling  technique  can  reach  a  more  gener- 
alized  level  as  shown  in  the  Option  Wizard,  How  They  Fool  Their  Customers 
(Chapter  20). 

As  a  method  of duplicating  the  put  through  delta  hedging,  portfolio  in- 
surance  was  a negative  gamma  trade.  It could  have  been  argued  that,  even  if 
portfolio  insurance  had  been  executed  through  actual  options,  the  market 
makers  would  have  been  short  the  same  amount  of gamma  thus  exacerbat- 
ing  the  movement  with  their  negative  curvature.  The  answer  is  that  the 
“free”  feature  of the  option  attracted  capital  to  the  asset  itself  thus  causing 
people  to  buy  the  stock  in  larger  quantities  than  if  the  program  did  not 
exist.  For  a  discussion  of  the  difference  between  a  true  option  and  its  dy- 
namically  replicated  equivalent  see  Grossman  (1988).’  * 

This  author  spent  one  year  in  the  SP500  pit after  the  crash  trying  to  re- 
constitute  the  episode  of October  1987,  as  a lessoh  in liquidity  management. 
To  understand  market-making  dynamics,  every  trader  should  spend  a  few 
months  in such a pit. At first,  the  tumultuous  pace  conceals  the  real  activity. 
After  a  while,  some  order  starts  to  emanate  from  the  pit’s  behavior.  That  is 
when  the  person  becomes  part  of this  large body  that  is a  marketplace. 

My conclusion  is that  locals  detected  a  pattern  of forced  selling  as  a  re- 
sult  of  lower  prices  in  the  market.  It  was  easily  detectable  that  the  freebie 
called  a  stop-loss  was  available  in  such  a  manner.  The  traders  rapidly  real- 
ized  that,  as  in  a  stop-loss,  the  decision  to  sell  was  not  relieved  by a  lower 
market  price:  In  fact,  it  turned  out  to  be  compounded  by the  lower  prices. 
The  classical  “front  running”  of the  stop-loss  order  was  made  easy  because 
only  one  forum  was  available  for  the  program  and  that  most  of it was  con- 
centrated  among  few  brokers. 

A  sixth  sense,  or  what  locals  call  “pit  chemistry,”  allows  them  to  iden- 
tify the  origin  of a  market  order  without  much  effort.  Living  in the  midst  of 
a  centralized  marketplace,  they can  identify  patterns  and  recognize  the  sig- 
nature  of every  player. 

It has  been  argued  that  portfolio  insurance  was  the  result  of the  worst 
possible  case  of market  equilibrium  attainment:  imperfect  information.  A 
large  measure  of anxiety  was  caused  by the  lack  of knowledge  about  infor- 
mation  in  the  market.  It is difficult  for  a market  maker  to  show a bid  for  a 
future  without  the  existence  of  order  in  the  marketplace.  One  can  also

conclude  that  portfolio  insurance  became  the  hostage  to  its  own  initial 
success:  smaller  amounts  under  the  program  would  not  have  caused  such 
a  snowballing  effect. 

LIQUIDITY  AND  OPTION  PRICING 

There  has  been  a  growing  awareness  in  the  option  pricing  literature  about 
the  existence  of transaction  costs.  Several  option  theories  have  been  devel- 
oped  in an  attempt  to  conciliate  market  microstructure  theories  and  option 
pricing.  Leland  (1985)  introduced  the  notion  of{a break-even  volatility 
in- 
an adjustment  for  transaction  costs.  Such  adjustment,  which  he 
_corporating 
calls  A,  is  added to  the volatility 
entered  into  the  risk-neutral  portfolio 
replication  of the  Black-Scholes-Merton  equation.  The  resulting  break-even 
volatility  for  a  short  seller  is the  augmented  volatility: 

ake  o,=aV(1  +  A) 

where 

eeu 

A=  /=x 

2 

k 

V7  oV dt 

o  represents  the  volatility  (vanilla  volatility),  k is the  round-trip  transaction 
costs  (in percentage),  and  dt  is the  time  interval  between  successive  adjust- 
ments  of the  pesone 

However,  the  trader  needs  to  take  into  account  that  an  option  book  will 
not  be  monotonically  long  or  monotonically  short  volatility,  but  that  the 
break-even  volatility  will  be  a markup  or  markdown  according  to  his  posi- 
tion.  The  short  premium  player  needs  a  higher  volatility  to  break  even 
while  the  long  player  needs  a  lower  volatility.  The  short  gamma  pays  the 
negative  spread  with  stop-losses,  while  the  long  premium  operator  has 
stop-profits  that  could  absorb  some  profits. 

| AMivaley and  Wilmott  (1993)  make  the  resulting  break-even  volatility  a 
“Gimple  function  of  the  sign  of  the  gamma.  As  earlier,  it  will  be  oV(1  +  A) 
when  the  operator  is  negative  gamma  and  oV(1  —  A)  when  the  operator 
is positive  gamma.  Hence  o(I)  =  oV(1  +  A sign(T)).  This  creates  a  situation 
of variable  volatility  with  the  resulting  complexities. 

Perhaps  the  area  in option  research  that  will  witness  the  largest  growth 
will  be  the  dynamic  analysis  of  option  risks  under  variable  transaction 
costs.  Replication  costs  for  an  option  market  maker  depend  on  more  factors 
than  the  sign  of the  gamma  as  with  Whalley  and  Wilmott  (1993). 

In  dealing  with  transaction  costs,  option  traders  have  massive  economies 
of scale  because  the  total  net  gamma  in their  portfolio  sometimes  will  be equal 

78 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

to  several  thousand  times  the  aggregate  gross  gamma  in  absolute  value  (i.e., 
the  sum  of the  gamma  in absolute  value  for every  option  in the  portfolio).  This 
makes  the  management  costs  of any  particular  option  minuscule. 

Another  factor,  more  difficult  to  assess,  is that  of the  asymmetry  in  op- 
tion  costs.  The  option  seller  and  the  option  buyer  are  not  quite  mirror  im- 
ages,  given  the  difference  in utility  function  between  the  two. 

/”  Risk  Management  Rule: 

Option  trader  lore  states  that  when  long 

gamma,  use  limit  orders.  When  short  gamma,  use  stop  orders. 

Vee option  trader  who  “sits  on  the  bid  or  the  offer”  when  short  gamma  is 
“said  to  be  penny-wise  and  pound-foolish.  He  would  later  have  to  “chase” 
the  market.  Conversely,  an  option  trader  who  pays  spreads  when  long 
gamma  is fooling  himself.  “Let  the  market  come  to  you”  is the  experienced 
trader’s  recommendation.  Table  4.1  shows  the  characteristics  of  short  and 
long gamma. 

An  option  seller  has  no  choice  whether  to  hedge  or  not,  hence  all  of his 
adjustments  need  to be  done  while  incurring  transaction  costs,  regardless  of 
his  status  as  a  market  maker.(A short  gamma  operator  needs  to  adjust  his 
gamma  using  stop orders)  which  are  triggered  with the  printing  of a  set  price 
in  the  marketplace.  A  stop-loss with  the  SP500  trading  at  455.00  will  cause 
the  order  filler  to  buy at best  in the  marketplace  once  455.00  officially  trades. 
The  stop  will  be  filled  at  455.00  plus  bid/offer  spread,  hence  transaction 
costs  will  be  incurred.  In  addition,  the  bid/offer  spread  typically  widens 
when  the  market  moves,  and  such  moves  generally  accompany  the  need  to 
rebalance.

An  option  buyer  incurs  less  transaction  costs,  if any.  A seasoned  long 
gamma  player  will  have  orders  that  go  against  the  market  and  will  know 
to  place  them  in the  marketplace  instead  of paying  the  spread  unnecessar- 
ily.  On  an  official  exchange,  the  order  cannot  be  violated  by the  market, 
which  means  that  the  market  cannot  trade  through  the  order  without a fill 
being  guaranteed.  It  is  also  the  case  for  orders  put  through  the  over-the- 
counter  broker  in  currencies.  Some  option  traders  (including  the  author) 
who  dislike  being  short  gamma  advocate  that  a  skillful  long  premium 
trader  will  in fact  earn  the  transaction  costs,  as  he can  become  a  secondary 
market  maker  in  the  cash  market.  Assume  that,  as  in  the  preceding  case, 
the  SP500  trades  at  449.80.  The  option  market  maker  being  long  gamma 
can  leave  an  order  at 450.00.  The  market  would  not  be able  to trade  without 
his  order  being  filled.  Assume  that  the  market  without  him  is  449.50, 
450.05.  By  offering  450.00,  he  then  can  hope  to  earn  part  of  the  spread. 
True,  the  market  makers  would  be  able  to  match,  but  a  certain  measure  of 
pit etiquette  gives  the  “paper”  the  right  to  get a  fill  along  with  the  market 
makers.  In  a  marketplace  like  the  Chicago  pits,  the  brokers  are  powerful 
and  can  command  better  fills  than  locals.  So  the  transaction  costs  are  lim- 
ited  to  the  commission,  a  negligible  cost  for  the  large  players. 

At  a  more  advanced  level,  every  known  market  experiences  the  negative 
autocorrelation  of prices  for  short-term  observations,  which  can  also  be inter- 
preted  as  mean  reversion  (see  correllogram  in Figure  3.3).  That  effect  should 
be  considered  in  any  discussion  about  implicit  bid-offer  spread,*  which  is 
wider  than  the  nominal  spread  as  the  latter  can  only  satisfy  small  transac- 
tions.  In some  less  liquid  markets,  such  as  the  individual  equities,  the  explicit 
spread  is  wider  than  the  implicit  spread  since  the  market  makers  display  a 
market  wider  than  their  intentions  to  trade  given  that  their  posted  price  rep- 
resents  a  short  option.  This  mean-reversion  will  cause  the  market  makers  to 
derive  an  “edge”  and  by extension  allows  skillful  positive  gamma  players  to 
profit  in the  execution  of their  hedges. 

When  it comes  to  barrier  options,  a  skilled  market  maker  who  is  short 
the  knock-out  or  long  the  knock-in  can  manipulate  the  market  to  improve 
on  his  fill.

A TRADER’S  DEFINITION! 

™@  Traders  define  arbitrage  as  a  form  of trading  that  makes  a  bet  on a dif- 
ferential  between  instruments,  generally  with  the  belief  that  the  re- 
turns  will  be  attractive  in  relation  to  the  risks  incurred.  Arbitrageurs 
believe  in  capturing  mispricings  between’  instruments  or  markets. 
Traders  tend  to  ascribe  the  term  “arbitrage”  for  a  wide  array  of trading 
activities  of varying  levels  of risks. 

In  more  formal  academic  literature  arbitrage  means  that  a  linear 
combination  of securities  costing  0 can  have  the  possibility  of turning 
up  with  a  positive  value  without  ever  having  a  negative  value. 
Traders’  definition  of  arbitrage  is  less  restrictive  and  can  be  phrased 
as  follows:  arbitrage  means  that  the  expected  value  of a  self-financing 
portfolio  (that  can  be  negative)  is positive.  The  issue  of risk  neutrality 
and  martingale  measure  (irrelevant  to  most  traders)  is  relegated  to 
Module  B. 

The  Oxford  English  Dictionary  (in  1971)  defines  it as:  “The  similar  traffic 
in  stocks,  so  as  to  take  advantage  of  the  difference  of  prices  at  which  the 
same  stock  may  be  quoted  at  the  same  time  in  the  exchange  markets  of 
distant  places.” 

There  are  different  levels  of arbitrage  as  shown  in  Table  5.1.  Some  trad- 
ing activities  that  escape  the  classification  in Table  5.1  carry  the  designation 
“arbitrage”  but  do  not  qualify  by any  stretch  of the  imagination.  “Risk  arbi- 
trage”  in  the  equity  markets  has  nothing  to  do  with  arbitrage;  it  refers  to 
takeover  where  the  trader  buys  the  stock  of the  company  being  acquired  and 
sells  that  of the  acquiring  one  (thus  doubling  the  risk).

MECHANICAL  VERSUS  BEHAVIORAL  STABILITY 

A bet  on  the  behavioral  stability  of a  relationship  is  a  weaker  form  of arbi- 
trage  than  one  that  attempts  to  capture  values  mechanically  linked. 

@  Mechanical  stability  means  that  two  instruments  have  an  identifiable 
link  between  them  and  such  link  is  possible  to  reproduce  artificially. 
Behavioral  stability  exists  when  one  has  to  marshal  historical  records 
to  establish  the  a  posteriori  link  between  two  instruments. 

e  Examples  of  mechanical  stability  include  locked-in  cost-of-carry, 
a  cross-currency  that  is  the  result  of  two  components,  a  forward- 
forward  box,  an  instrument  that  converges  exactly  into  another. 
e  Examples  of  behavioral  stability  are  U.S.  versus  Canadian  swap 
curves,  German  versus  Swiss  interest  rates  (until  the  Berlin  Wall  fell, 

82 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

and  with  it the  stability  of the  relationship),  and  corporate  bonds.  Be- 
cause  there  are  no  true,  identifiable  links  between  the  commodities, 
it is not  possible  to bridge  them  mechanically,  but  history  shows a re- 
markable  price  stability,  to  such  extent  that  one  could  replace  the 
other  in  a  hedge.  These  apparent  relationships  provide  the  market 
with  booby  traps. 

THE  DETERMINISTIC  RELATIONSHIPS 

In  arbitrageur’s  parlance,  deterministic  relationships  are  ones  that  can  be 
matched  entirely,  creating  perfect,  or  close  to  perfect  arbitrages.  Hedging  a 
deterministic  relationship  will  produce  an  ironclad  protection  that  should 
resist  all  market  moves  and  remain  stable  over  time. 

Deterministic  relationships  are  opposed  to behavioral,  or  stochastic  re- 
lationships,  where  there  is  a  correlation  between  instruments  or  some  de- 
pendence  but  that  cannot  be expected  to  resist  all  kinds  of eventualities. 

The  following  are  examples  of deterministic  relationships: 

¢  A basket  is only  the  sum  of its  components.  It can  therefore  be  repli- 

cated  by buying  or  selling  every  component. 

e  A  cross-currency,  like  a German  mark/Japanese  yen  cross-currency 
exposure  can  be  replicated  exactly  with  dollar  versus  German  mark 
and  dollar  versus  Japanese  yen. 

¢  A knock-out  call  can  be replicated  with  a  vanilla  and  a  knock-in  call, 

all  having  the  same  strikes  and  out-strikes. 

The  following  are  examples  of behavioral  relationships: 

e  Hedging  a  bond  exposure  with  a  swap  is  taking  advantage  of a sta- 
ble,  not  certain,  relationship.  The  Italian  swap  market  stops  tracking 
the bond  market  when a crisis  causes  a  divergence  between  the  cred- 
itworthiness  of  the  government  and  that  of  financial  institutions. 
The  U.S.  “flight  to  quality”  can  also  cause  a  divergence  between  the 
different  issuers. 

e  The  common  practice  of hedging  a  currency  exposure  with  another 
one  (e.g.,  “stacking”  exposure  to European  exchange  rates  by concen- 
trating  the  hedge  in  the  German  mark,  owing  to  its  liquidity)  can 
sometimes  bring  surprises. 

¢  Using  all  the  value-at-risk  numbers  as  exposure  presents  the  same 

uncertainty  as  the  preceding  hedges.

PASSIVE  ARBITRAGE 

M@  Passive  Arbitrage’  is the  capital  neutral  swapping  of an  asset  against  an- 

other  similar  one  that  presents  more  attractive  features. 

Many  operators  can  engage  in  arbitrage  activities  while  carrying  only  one 
leg of the  spread  on  their  books.  Investors  who  own a security  can  replace  it 
with  a  similar  one  that  commands  a higher  return  or  carries  a  lower  risk, 
and  thus  help  increase  their  potential  earnings. 

Investors  who  need a certain  exposure  to  the  stock  market  can  replace 
their  baskets  with  futures  when  the  prices  become  more  attractive.  They 
could  either  carry  the  futures  until  expiration  (and  get back  to  the  market 
by buying  cash  on  the  last  day of trading  at  the  settlement  price)  or  switch 
again  when  the  price  differential  flips in  favor  of the  baskets. 

Bond  portfolio  holders  willing  to  maintain  a  set  exposure  can  roll  their 
positions  along  the  yield  curve  to  the  most  attractive  issues.  They  can 
search  for  the  “value”  point  that  offers  the  highest  yield  or  the  fastest  “roll” 
on  the  curve  (see  the  discussion  of convergence  in Chapter  12).  They can  also 
switch  back  and  forth  between  issues  as  the  relationships  switch.  On-the- 
run,  liquid issues command a higher price (lower yield), usually to compen- 
“sate for their liquidity.  In  some bond  markets  like  that  in  Italy,  the 
difference  between  liquid  and  illiquid  bonds  can  be  significant.  Such  pre- 
mium  for  liquidity  should  be of small  relevance  to  the  long-term  holder  and 
active  switching  between  issues  presents  rewards. 

Companies  with a set  level  of financing  needs  can  play the  swap  market 
to  improve  their  costs  without  significant  alteration  in  the  level  of the  risks 
incurred. 

Companies  with  foreign  currency  exposures  can  select  the  most  attrac- 
tive  periods  to  establish  their  long-term  contracts.  They  can  also  actively 
move  their  exposure  up  and  down  the  curves  to  the  optimal  hedging  point. 
Most  fund  managers  have  their  performance  indexed  to  an  industry  av- 
erage.  The  needs  to  beat  the  average  force  them  to  act  like  short-term 
traders.  They  can  attain  better  value  through  indirect  arbitrage. 

Sometimes  the  passive  arbitrageur  has  distinct  advantages  over  the  ac- 
tive  one.  The  holder  of  Japanese  stocks  would  have  better  luck  swapping 
them  into  convertible  securities  when  these  are  priced  to  the  onerous  stock 
borrowing  costs  of  the  marginal  arbitrageur.  Convertible  securities  would 
track  the  stock  thanks  to  arbitrage,  but  if stocks  are  expensive  to  borrow, 
they  will  be  discounted  to  compensate  for  the  additional  costs.  If a  fund 
manager  needs  to  own  Japanese  stocks,  however,  it may  be  more  optimal  to 
swap  his  holdings  into  convertibles  and  hedge  the  residual  interest  rate  risk. 
His  expected  return  will  therefore  be  enhanced  by  the  cheapness  of  the 
warrants  that  the  arbitrageurs  are  unable  to  capture. 

84 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

Examples  of such  advantages  abound.  Expensive  bonds  are  difficult  to 
short  when  their  repo  cost  is high.  The  passive  arbitrageur,  however,  would 
not  need  to  worry  about  the  repo  when  he  owns  the  bond  and  can  replace  it 
with  one  with a better  yield. 

AN  ABSORBING  BARRIER  CALLED  THE  “SQUEEZE” 

~ 

of the  pernicious  aspects  of arbitrage  is  that,  while  a  trade  could  prove 
Oné 
Otally  and  mechanically  hedged,  which  means  that  the  profits  will  be unde- 
niably  realized  on  expiration  regardless  of what  happens  during  delivery,  op- 
erators  could  still  go bankrupt.  One  example  is program  trading  in which  the 
short  future/long  stock  will  have  to  pay  in  cash  for  the  losses  on  the  future 
leg,  without  collecting  anything  from  the  paper  profits  on  the  stock  side.  A 
sharp  rise  would  easily  deplete  the  trader’s  capital:  Ironically,  it is the  most 
undeniable  form  of arbitrage  that  can  be  the  most  biting.  The  operator,  obvi- 
ously,  will  not  be alone  in such a situation,  and  the  trade  will  widen,  making 
the  sale  of stocks  against  the  purchase  of the  future  unattractive.  This  is the 
case  of a  classical  squeeze:  Only  the  most  capitalized  can  survive;  those  who 
have  “deep  pockets”  can  buy the  inventories  of the  distressed  smaller  firms. 
The  same  risks  can  affect  the  conversions  and  reversals  in  markets 
\Y  subject  to  the  future  marks-to-market  rules,  where  profits  and  losses  on 
the  futures  legs  are  immediately  collected  and  option  profits  are  only  to 
be  realized  at  expiration. 

DURATION  OF  THE  ARBITRAGE 

@  The  duration  of  arbitrage  (for  a  portfolio  constituted  of path-indepen- 
dent  products)  is  the  weighted  average  time  to  expiration  value  of  the 
absolute  amounts  in  a  book.  This  number  needs  not  to  be  weighted  by 
any  other  factor  as  it discloses  information  that  affects  not  necessarily 
the  P/L  risks  but  a  spate  of intangible  risks,  such  as  personnel  risks. 

For  path dependent  products  it is advisable  to  use  stopping  time,  as 

explained  in Chapter  19.  (It is often  called  first-exit  time.) 

This  measure  works  well  with  linear  products.  If the  operator  is  long  the 
one  year  and  short  the  two  years  in equal  amounts  the  duration  of the  arbi- 
trage  is one  and a half  years. 

The  institutional  structure  of  Wall  Street  and  the  frequency  of  the  ac- 
counting  period  create  a  predilection  for  immediate  profits.  Guaranteed 
profits  tomorrow  against  profits  today would  not  do:  The  manager  might  lose 
his  job  or  (even  worse)  be  penalized  in  his  compensation.  Traders  are  not 
noted  for  their  tolerance  of  pain.  The  accounting  period  punctuates  Wall 

Arbitrage  and  the  Arbitrageurs 

85 

Street’s  horizon.  Some  aggressive  brokerage  firms  have  been  penalized  by 
the  market  for  the  “proprietary  trading  losses”  in  one  quarter  when  they 
were  holding  high-quality  convergence  trades  (such  as  the  Italian  interest 
rate  swaps  against  government  paper).  Two  results  come  to  mind:  (1)  The 
analysis  of any  payoff partakes  of a  larger  utility  framework  and  (2) the  same 
arbitrage  varies  in attractiveness  between  traders  owing  to  the  differences  in 
utility  curves.  There  should  be  a  constant  shifting  of trades  between  the  nar- 
row-minded  and  the  infinitely  patient. 

Such  predilection  for  short-term  profits  makes  the  efficient  market 
frontier  unenforceable  as  the  returns  for  securities  would  have  additional 
path-dependent  restrictions  put on  them. 

ARBITRAGE  AND  THE  ACCOUNTING  SYSTEMS 

It is often  easier  to  arbitrage  one’s  accounting  system  than  the  market.  The 
derivatives  markets  are  growing  faster  than  the  systems  to  properly  ac- 
count  for  them.  Here  is a  short  list  of examples: 

¢  Some  complex  option-related  products,  such  as  index-amortizing 
swaps  or  most  correlation  products  are  not  seasoned  enough  for  the 
market  to  agree  on  a  uniform  pricing  formula.  The  absence  of market 
price  allows  firms  to  mark  to  their  parameters  and  delude  them- 
selves  in that  way.  Correlation  (not an  observable  asset  in the  market) 
could  be  derived  on  a  three-month  historical  data  at  one  shop  and 
one-month  at  another.  Both  would  be  wrong  as  correlation  might  be 
so  unstable  as  not  really  to  exist.  The  absence  of norms  would  allow 
two  traders  at  different  houses  to  book  different  profits  or  losses  on 
the  same  trade.  Unlike  listed  products,  there  is no  benchmark  to  use 
as  a  control  figure  to  correct  one’s  estimation.  There  is  no  escape 
from  theoretical  marking  to  market  and  the  theory  is  not  robust 
enough  yet. 

e  Money  market  and  swap  traders  often  arbitrage  the  credit  rating  of 
their  employer.  They  can  borrow  money  better  than  they  can  place  it 
at  for  the  same  maturity,  and  their  accounting  system  could  easily 
pick  up  the  projected  cash-flow  differentials  as  profits,  as  few  sys- 
tems  discount  the  creditworthiness  of  the  counterpart.  There  are 
counterpart  limits,  but  no  counterpart  pricing  schedules  in  ordinary 
systems.  The  money  is ultimately  earned  (barring  bankruptcies),  but 
it  belongs  to  the  institution’s  credit  department,  which  ultimately 
bears  the  risk,  not  to  the  trader’s  skills. 

e  Traders  in  some  houses  do  not  pay  interest  on  the  realized  losses. 
They  earn  interest,  though,  on  the  unrealized  profits,  under  the  dis- 
counting  method  (e.g.,  an  option  trader  is long  future  against  a  long 

86 

Markets,  Instruments,  People 

put;  the  profits  in  the  puts  will  converge  using  the  Exp(-r  t) process 
while  the  future  losses  are  not  accounted  for  in the  funding).  Traders 
could,  in  a  limited  way,  take  advantage  of the  system. 
Most  profits  on  complex  options  show  immediately  on  booking  the 
trade.  A  trader  selling  a  complex  note  will  be  marked  at  some  “fair 
value”  that  approximates  the  theoretical  break-even  point but  in a fric- 
tionless  market,  that  is, one  where  the  subsequent  adjustments  to  the 
trade  took  place  without  the  costs  associated  with  hedging  (spreads 
and  commissions).  If the  trader  were  to  add  up  the  costs  of  dynamic 
hedging  the  product  over  the  life  of the  option,  he  would  be  surprised 
at  the  decrease  in  the  potential  profits.  Trades  that  require  the  adjust- 
ments  with  Eurodollar  futures  would  suffer  the  most.  Currencies,  es- 
pecially  the  less  liquid  ones,  require  onerous  costs  of  rebalancing  in 
cash,  rollovers,  and  options.  Usually,  the  trader  stays  ahead  by contin- 
uously  booking  new  “profitable”  trades,  then  pays  the  price  on  liqui- 
dation  of  the  position  or  when  the  stream  of  new  deals  slows  to  a 
trickle  (as it did  in  1996).

types  of  arbitrages,  including  the  following,  do  not  fall  within  the

cheaper  price  than  the  debt  in another.  This  is generally  done  as  a  pas- 
sive  arbitrage  activity,  defined  earlier.  It is usually  difficult  to  short  a 
corporate  bond  because  of  the  occasional  difficulties  in  borrowing 
them.  However,  a  bonds  portfolio  manager  can  improve  his  expected 
return  and  maintain  the  overall  rating  in  his  portfolio  by optimizing 
the  mix  between  issues  and  swapping  the  expensive  ones  for  better 
value  bonds.  Credit  rating  is not  a  market  function,  and  as a trader  first 
and  last,  the  author  recommends  listening  to  the  market  rather  than  to 
the  credit  agencies  in  the  definition  of ranking.  Such  skepticism  would 
therefore  invalidate  many  perceived  “value  trades”  and  arbitrages. 

Tax  Arbitrage.  Many  equity  swaps  are  due  to  the  privileged  tax 
treatment  of one  party  in  the  market.  That  party  can  then  arbitrage 
its  condition  by transferring  the  tax  to  the  other  party  for  a  profit. 
For  example,  German  tax  laws  impose  a  dividend  withholding  tax  on 
foreign,  but  not  domestic,  investors.  A foreigner  can  replicate  the  po- 
sition  by entering  in  a  transaction  with  a  domestic  German  entity 
that  matches  the  payoff of the  equity  swap.  The  German  party  can  ar- 
bitrage  the  situation  by buying  the  equities  and  selling  the  forward 
to  foreign  counterparties. 

Arbitrage  and  the  Arbitrageurs 

87 

e  Legal  Arbitrage. 

Some  parties  are  disallowed  by their  authorities  or 
their  bylaws  to  engage  in some  specific  transactions.  Domestic  French 
residents,  to  give  an  example,  were  banned  at  some  point  in  the  1980s 
from  buying  puts  or  shorting  their  currency.  Another  case  of legal  ar- 
bitrage  is  the  structured  note  market  where  the  payoff  is  tied  to  the 
performance  of some  market,  hence  includes  an  option,  but  is  flower- 
ing with  fund  managers  who  are  not  allowed  to  buy  options.  The  law 
is  skirted  through  the  veil  of  the  note  and  the  fund  manager  is  then 
“trapped”  since  he  cannot  deconstruct  the  note  himself  and  needs  to 
go to  the  bank  to  secure  a  market  for  the  option. 

ARBITRAGE  AND  THE  VARIANCE  OF  RETURNS 

The  definition  of  arbitrage  is  becoming  controversial  as  many  forms  of 
trading  defined  as  arbitrage  often  carry  a  higher  variance  of returns  than 
outright  directional  trading.  This  is  partly  because  the  average  arbi- 
trageur  carries  larger  amounts  on  his  books  than  the  average  speculative 
trader.  It is also  due  to  the  accumulation  of positions  by like-minded  arbi- 
trageurs,  which  puts  the  pressure  on  relationships.  When  a  security  be- 
comes  perceived  as  expensive,  there  will  be  a  rush  of  traders  shorting  it 
and  buying  a  similar  instrument.  If the  security  stays  so  for  a  longer  time 
owing  to  a  specific  buyer,  the  accumulation  will  turn  too  large  for  the  ar- 
bitrage  community  to  handle  and  traders  will  reach  their  limits.  As  the 
arbitrage  community  reaches  its  saturation  level,  pressure  on  the  relation- 
ship  between  what  is  deemed  expensive  and  what  is  deemed  cheap  will 
cause  severe  marks-to-market  losses.  Liquidation  of  the  less  capitalized 
arbitrageurs  will  ensue. 

“Inefficiencies  in  the  market  will  last  longer  than  traders  can  remain  solvent,” 

an  option  trader  once  said.

Volatility  and  Correlation 

What  traders  and  historians  share  is  an  ingrained  distrust  of the  notion  of 
correlation. 

An  option  veteran 

This  chapter  introduces  the  notion  of volatility  using  minimum  mathemat- 
ics.  The  reader  should  try to  develop  a  sense  of where  the  notion  of volatil- 
ity can  be  ambiguous. 

M  Volatility  is best  defined  as  the  amount  of variability  in the  returns  of a 
particular  asset.  (As will  be  discussed,  there  are  many variations  in  the 
methods  of measurement): 

Actual  volatility  is the  actual  movement  experienced  by the  market. 
It is often  called  historical,  sometimes  historical  actual. 

Implied  volatility  is  the  volatility  parameter  derived  from  the  option 
prices  for  a  given  maturity.  Operators  use  the  Black-Scholes-Merton 
formula  (and  its derivatives)  as  a benchmark.  It is therefore  customary 
to  equate  the  option  prices  to  their  solution  using  the  Black-Scholes- 
Merton  method,  even  if one  believes  that  it is inappropriate  and  faulty, 
rather  than  try to  solve  for a  more  advanced  pricing  formula. 

Correlation  refers  to  the  least-square  measured  association  between 
two  random  variables.  It identifies  the  degree  of certainty  with  which  a 
person  can  predict  the  move  in  one  random  variable  as  a  result  of  a 
change  in  the  other  variable.  The  random  variables  concerned  are  the 
logarithmic  returns  of  the  assets  [or  Log  (Price  Period  t) —  Log  (Price 
Period?  =  ))is 

Actual  correlation  is  the  amount  of  actual  association  between  the 
moves  of two  markets.  It is often  called  historical,  sometimes  histor- 
iGal  actual: 

¢(  Implied correlation is  the correlation  parameter  derived  from  option 
prices of the  components)  There  will  be as  many  implied  correlations 
as  existing  maturities.  (Module  D includes  an  explanation  for  calcu- 
lating  the  implied  correlation  using  the  triangle.)

Option  Wizard:  Correlation  and  Volatility 

Traders  often  make  the  simple  blunder  of assuming  that  a  100%  correlation  be- 
tween  two  assets  A  and  B  means  that  asset  A  should  move  by 1%  in response 
to  asset  B moving  up  by 1%  (in the  same  direction).  This  is not  true:  They could 
be  correlated  by  100%  and  asset  B  can  move  by  2%  for  every  1%  move  in 
asset¢§,  if asset  B has  twice  the  volatility  of Sey 
What  correlation  really  means  is the  expected 

ratio  of the  moves  between 

assets  divided  by their  corresponding  volatility. 

The  assumption  behind  most  random  walk  models  is that  of lognormal- 
ity,  which  is  a  necessary  solution  to  the  restriction  that  assets  cannot  (in 
theory)  have  a  negative  price.  Module  A  describes  the  process  of a  random 
walk  and  describes  correlation,  The  most  dangerous assumption  is that  of a 
constant  correlation.  Traders  beware:  Markets  have  adjusted  to  the  fact  that 
SEND  Ua  te  not  yet to  the  fact  that  correlation is  volatile. 

Figure 6.1 

shows  the  cumulative  distribution  of one standard  deviation 
over  time.  eee  15.7%  annualized  volatility, the market  is  expected 
to  move  1%  per  day,  2.23%  every  5 days  (1%  X  V5  ), 4.47%  every  20  days 
(1%  X  V20),  15.7%  every  248  days—a  business  year  (1%  X  V248) 

Theorists  have  discussed  at  length  whether  the  market  ee a  geo- 
metric  Brownian  motion  or  an  arithmetic  one.  (See  Table  6.1,  Figures  6.2 
and  6.3.)  The  difference  can  easily  be  explained  as  follows:

Option  Wizard:  “Perhaps  Bachelier  Was  Right” 

Many  of the  caps/floor  book  runners  were  hurt  by the  rally  in  Eurodollars  (drop 
in  yield)  between  1991  and  1993.  With  interest  rates  at  9%,  it was  remarkable 
that  historical  volatility  was  close  to  about  9  basis  points  per  day  on  average. 
Market  markers,  however,  were  selling  out-of  the  money  calls  with  the  belief 
that  “percentage”  volatility  would  be  unchanged  in  the  rally,  which  means  that 
at  4.5%  Eurodollars,  the  mired volatility,”  or  “dollar  volatility,”  would  be  close 
to  4.5  basis  points.  They  were  proven  wrong  as  the  tick  volatility  remained  al- 
most  constant,  and(their  positions  in  out-of-the-money  calls  made  them  short  Fuslay 
volatility  at  very  low  evels.) 

oe 

igi 

“peach 

The  rally  in  the  Eurodeposits  resulted  in  a  rise  in  implied  and  historical 
volatility  as  defined  by option  theory  (i.e.,  lognormal  returns).  Somehow  the 
price  of  the  at-the-money  straddle  in  ticks  remained  close  to  the  same  level 
throughout.  This  prompted  a  famous  market  thinker  to  confide  to  the  author: 
“Perhaps,  after  all,  that  man  Bachelier  was  right.”  He  was  indicating  Louis 
Bachelier,  the  French  mathematician,  who  wrote  his  doctoral  dissertation  in 
1900,  73  years  before  Black  and  Scholes,  pricing  options  with  an  arithmetic 
Brownian  motion.  Bachelier  was  mistreated  by history  for  a  long time.* 

Euroyen  traders  experienced  considerably  more  trauma.  As  short-term  in- 
terest  rates  in  1995  reached  .10%,  a  1  basis  point  move  corresponded  to 
160%  volatility.  Volatility  moved  during  the  rally  from  the  “social”  levels 
(around  20%)  to  200%  as  the  Eurodeposit  traders  were  not  informed  that  the 
market  needs  to  be  lognormal.  In  addition,  Bachelier’s  model  seemed  perfectly 
credible  as  the  market  started  paying  for  100  calls  (puts  struck  at  zero)  based 
on  the  belief  that  the  possibility  of  the  market  going  negative  could  not  be 
ruled  out. 

Moral:  Traders  should  take  theoretical  dogma  less  seriously.

terms  needs  to be higher  at higher  prices.  It also  explains  why volatil- 
ity would  drop  as  the  market  weakens,  a  dampening  that  would  pre- 
vent  the  market  from  reaching  negative  levels.  ‘As  the  market  drops 
from  100  to  1,  15.7%,  volatility  would  represent  .01  ticks.  At  .10  it 
would  be  .001  and  so  on. 

5 or ¢  (An arithmetic  Brownian motion  means  that  the  market  maintains 
ro  oo  constant  expected  dollar  moves,  regardless  of its  level) This  assump- 
tion  is  refuted  by academics  because  it can  lead  to  possible  negative 
asset  prices.  However,  traders  take  it seriously  as  they believe  that  for 
medium-size  increments,  the  assumption  holds.  In  addition,  money 
market  instruments  have  unexpectedly  flirted  with  negative  prices 
throughout  history.’ 

e 

a The  interesting  results  of  a  mixed  process  usually  witnessed  in  fi- 
nancial  markets—arithmetic in the  short  term  and  geometric in the 
Jong run— —will  be  discussed  later in this book. 

CALCULATING  HISTORICAL  VOLATILITY 
AND  CORRELATION 

. 

Centering  around  the  Mean 

" 

For  ease  of calculation  as  well  as  theoretical  reasons,  volatility  of returns 
for  a dynamic  hedger  could  be  calculated  as  the  square  root  of the  sum  of 
the  squares  of the  movements,  not  the  deviations  from  an  average.  If a  mar- 
ket  moved  1%  a  day  every  day  in  the  same  direction  (say  upward)  for  an 
entire  month,  the  conventional  measurement  of volatility  would  put  it at 
0%  since  all  of the  moves  were  at  the  mean  move.  This  clashes  with  an  op- 
tion  trader’s  instinct.  An  option  trader  would  still  consider  it to  be  1%  a 
day  and  in  this  case  would  prefer  to  buy  volatility  when  it  is  offered 
cheaper  than  16%. 

Statistically,  given  the  absence  of  well-pronounced  trends,  or  trends 

that  dominate  the  variance,  both  measures  present  similar  results.°

Ditching  the  x, the  mean  return,  means  there  is  one  parameter  less  to 
estimate.  It also  makes  the  estimation  of volatility  closer  to  what  would  af- 
fect  a  trader’s  P/L.*  So the  volatility  (nonweighted)  noncentered  o’  could  be 
expressed  as:

To  annualize  and  express  the  volatilities  using  the  trader’s  conventions, 
multiply  by the  annualization  factor.  If the  returns  from  calculating  volatil- 
ity  are  daily  and  the  year  is  considered  to  be  248  days,  the  trader  would 
multiply  the  figure  by  V 248.  If the  returns  are  weekly,  he  would  then  mul- 
tiply by V52, and  so  on. 

Note  that  the  trader  could  multiply  by  V365  provided  he  added  the 
weekends  in the  data  series;  that  would  add  two  zeros  per  week  to  the  com- 
putation  and  would  be  roughly  equal  with  some  variance  for  the  shorter 
dates. 

Table  6.2  provides  an  example  of  historical  volatility  calculation.  It 
shows  daily  prices  (for  an  imaginary  pair)  in  succession  for  22  days.  This 
yields  21  returns.  Column  3 calculates  the  natural  logarithm  of  the  return 
and  Column  4 calculates  the  square  of  the  Log(S,/S,_  ,). The  annualized 
volatility  is computed  as  the  square  root  of the  sum  of Column  4 /21  multi- 
plied  by the  square  root  of 248  =  10.73%.

INTRODUCING  FILTERING 

What  volatility  should  be used?  10 days?  100  days?  ..  .  There  is, fortunately 
for  traders,  no  straight  answer,  and  such  disagreements  help  create  a  mar- 
ket.  Some  traders  with  a  long memory  prefer  to  go back  many  years,  while 
others  are  victims  of some  form  of market  amnesia. 

Filtering  is  a  simple  method  for  taking  into  account  that  events  in  the 
past  need  to  have  uneven  weightings  (see  Figure  6.4).  The  following  text 
presents  a  simplified  version  of the  Kalman  filter:  the  exponential  decay.” 

It behooves  the  trader  to  assign  importance  to  recent  events  in  propor- 
tion  to  their  distance  away  from  the  present.  But  the  trader  should  be  flexi- 
ble  enough  not  to  take  the  measurement  for  gospel,  either  because  he  may 
have  information  about  a  predicted  riot  tomorrow  that  would  make  all  past 
information  academic,  or  because  some  structural  changes  took  place  that 
need  to  have  an  effect  on  the  weighting.  The  last  thing  a  trader  needs  to  do 
is be scientific  or  play econometrician  during  business  hours.

Figures  6.5  through  6.9  will  show  the  trader  to  beware  the  notion  of  con- 
stant  volatility  and,  even  more,  that  of constant  correlation. 

Figure  6.5  shows  implied  volatility  in  the  USD-DEM  for  the  one-month 

options  during  a  part  of 1992. 

Figure  6.6  shows  actual  two-week  volatility  in  the  SP500.  The  volatility 
of the  SP500  shot  up  to  120%  the  week  of  the  crash  of October  1987,  which

Option  Wizard:  Rubber  Time  Explained 

The  notion  of  economic  versus  actual  time  crops  up  once  in  the  while  in  dis- 
cussions  between  option  traders.  It  is  a  difficult  matter  but  seems  to  be  ad- 
justed  for  properly  by the  markets. 

Trading  on  the  weekend  does  not  take  place  too  often.  Markets  are  as- 
sumed  to  be  open  about  247  days  (except  for  European  countries  with  a 
plethora  of holidays). 

Traders  price  the  process  in  volatility  of 365  days  but  actually  adjust  back 
by removing  holidays.  For  example,  if they  decided  to  price  a  Tuesday  option 
on  a Friday,  they  would  use  the  number  of business  days  (2)  and  would  manip- 
ulate  the  formula  that  uses  5 days  to  pretend  that  the  volatility  over  the  next  5 
days  would  be  low  enough  to  accommodate  for  the  actual  moves.  If they  as- 
sumed  that  volatility  is supposed  to  be  15.7%  in the  market  per  actual  number 
of  days,  it would  be  1%  for  1  day,  1.41%  for  2  days,  15.7%  for  1  year,  and 
so  on...  The  operator  on  a  Friday  would  use  the  volatility  that  would  give 
such  result  of  the  expected  move  of  1.41%  over  4  days,  namely  11.08% 
(1.41%/V4 = .71  x V247  =  11.08%). 

More  advanced  methods  give  a  weight  per  actual  day  and  assume  that 
Sundays  can  exist  as  a  source  of  volatility  since  nasty*revolutions  can  take 
place  at  such  idle  times.  Many  operators  count  Saturday  and  Sundays  as  quar- 
ter  days  in  the  winter  and  even  less  in  the  summer. 

Some  traders  actually  price  options  “on  the  clock”  with  a  real  almanac  of 
expected  market  moves  that  lower  the  intensity  of  lunchtime  in  Tokyo  when 
markets  go  into  a  slumber. 

The  important  intuition  traders  need  to  grasp  is that  volatility  and  square 

root  of time  have  the  same  effect  on  the  dispersion  of a  random  walk.

When  measuring  the  volatility  of  volatility  traders  should  be  careful  to 
avoid  running  overlapping  data.  In addition,  the  length  of the  period  matters, 
and  it is recommended  to  select  as  short  a period  between  sampling  points  as 
possible.  Figures  6.6  and  6.7  show  that  historical  volatility  moves  even  more 
than  implied. 

Correlation  is  even  more  volatile  than  both  volatility  and  the  underly- 
ing  itself.  Figures  6.8  and  6.9  show  the  correlations  of  the  daily  moves  in 
nonoverlapping  periods  of two  weeks. 

One  does  not  have  to  be a statistician  to  understand  that  correlation 

moves  all  the  time.

the  vantage  point  of option  pricing.

THE  PARKINSON  NUMBER  AND  THE 
VARIANCE  RATIO  METHOD 

Among  the  most  significant  contributions  to  option  traders  are  the  Parkinson 
number  and  the  variance  ratio  method. 

( The  Parkinson  number,  generated  by the  physicist  Michael  Parkinson  in 
1980,  aims  at  estimating  the  volatility  of returns  for  a  (geometric)  random 
walk  using  only the high and  low  in any  particular  period)  This  section  will 
show  how  to  use  it selectively,  most  often  in  reverse,  to derive  the  distribu- 
tion  of the  maximum  or  minimum  in any  day knowing  the  historical  volatil- 
ity.° The  Parkinson  number  will  be called  the  P: 

of  P=  eu  :

Su ; 

We  have  S,, and  S, the  close-to-close  registered  high and  the  registered  low 
respectively  in  any  particular  time  frame. 

e  All  traders  respect  the  integrity  of the  close-to-close  number  because 
of its  official  nature  but  are  cautious  about  taking  the  high or  low  be- 
cause  of the  misprints  and  manipulations  attending  its  registration. 
Sometimes  fictitious  trades  take  place  at  one  level  owing  to  manipu- 
lation  while  at  other  times  computer  errors  mar  the  data. 
In  addition,  there  are  many  instances  in  cash  over-the-counter  prod- 
ucts,  such  as  illiquid  foreign  exchange  markets,  where  a  new  high  or 
a new  low  could  escape  the  screens  and  remain  the  sole  knowledge  of 
the  traders  involved  in the  trade. 

e  Finally  the  Parkinson  number  applies  to  a  24-hour  period  assuming 
no  closing  of  the  market  and  no  discontinuities  (an  even  number  of

Option  Wizard:  “GARCH  in Their  Head” 

Option  traders  can  easily  understand  ARCH  modeling  precisely  because  they 
“have  GARCH  in  their  heads”  as  said  one  trader  to  whom  the  concept  was  ex- 
plained  on  a  yellow  sandwich  bag.  Indeed,  they  have  a  much  better  one  than 
that  presently  available  to  econometricians. 

Sometime  in  1982,  Engle*  discovered  heteroskedasticity 

(i.e.,  changing  _ 

volatility) in times  series  on  British  inflation,  and  started  the  first attempt at 
‘modeling  it.  It  resulted  in  ARCH  (autoregressive  conditional  heteroskedastic- 
ity),  which  was  an  effort  to  estimate  the  volatility  process  using  techniques 
from  times  series  analysis  called  autoregressive  models.  It assumed  that  future 
volatility  was  linked  to  its  past  realizations,  each  realization  having  its  own 
weight.  Intuitively,  it can  be  described  as  a  process  that  can  be  forecast  using 
past  volatility  data  in  a  decreasing  manner  (as  with  the  filtering  technique). 
“Volatility  begets  volatility,”  as  the  saying  goes.  A volatile  day  is more  likely  to 
be  followed  by a  volatile  day  and  a  quiet  one  by a  quiet  one.  Inexpensive  soft- 
ware  packages  now  help the  researcher  in  “fitting”  the  parameters  to  come  up 
with  an  elaborate  (but  alas  fragile)  prediction  tool.’ 

After  Engle,  a deluge  of models  started  hitting  the  academic  world,  attempt- 
ing to  make  it more  potent.  Bollerslev  and  Engel  generalized  it to  GARCH  (both 
autoregressive  and  moving  average).  The  most  interesting  development  came 
with  Nelson’s  E-GARCH  (exponential),  which  considered  that  the  volatility 
shocks  down  (when the market drops) are the significant  part in determining  fu- 
ture  volatility,  a  fact  familiar  to  equity  traders  and  Mexican  peso  investors. 

Later  more  complex  GARCH  models  were  built  on  the  realization  that 
shocks  that  generally  matter  are  those  where  some  threshold  is  broken,  those 
that  depend  on  a  regime  condition,  and  so  on.  Then  came  N-GARCH  (nonlin- 
ear),  SWARCH  (switching  regime),  and  others.  H-GARCH  (heterogeneous)  used 
a  time  scale  that  is similar  to  the  concept  of rubber  time  for  an  option  trader.  The 
models  are  getting  closer  to  a  seasoned  option  trader’s  opinion,  which  could  be 
that  past  information  about  the  price  action  impacts  future  volatility,  but  in 
some  complex  way.  Subtle  sets  of  rules  in  the  trader’s  mind  help  him  form  his 
own  opinion  in  a  more  potent  way  than  these  data-processing  techniques.  This 
might  explain  why  ARCH  and  siblings  (even  the  neural  network  extensions) 
never  made  an  impact  in the  trading  room:  They  are  still  at  this  point  but  a  weak 
imitation  of  a  veteran  trader’s  mind.  Implied  volatility,  basically  the  trader’s 
opinion,  outperforms  GARCH  predictions  except  where  squeezes  take  place 
that  make  the  implied  reach  abnormal  proportions.  Otherwise,  it would  be  used 
with  more  success  (see  Taleb,  1996a). 
~  Finally,  one  reason  GARCH  never  made  it is that  implied  volatility  contains 
information  that_is  not  available  in  past  prices  (e.g.,  scheduled  elections, 
economic  releases)  but  that  are  significant  in  determining  future  volatility.

not  impact  the  currency  pair  but  traders  know  that  the  outcome  will  result  in  a 
jump  (up or  down,  pending  the  nature  of the  agreement);  such  information  is 
not  contained  in  past  prices.  As  a  matter  of fact,  volatility  would  freeze,  as  the 
market  will  be  numb  to  any  information  on  the  currency  prior  to  the  meeting. 
So  GARCH  would  predict  a  drop  in volatility. 

Cay some  information  that  was  available  in  past  prices  (e.g.,  jumps 
du 
elections)  does  not  appear  to  bear  any  significance  for  future  volatility 
owing  to  its  nonrecurring  nature) A  trader  knows  how  to  filter  them  in  his 
volatility  prediction  in  a  way  that  econometricians  do  not.  As  a  community, 
traders  benefit  from  close  to  three  decades  of oral  tradition  and  war  stories. 

The  conclusion  is  we  conclude  that  in  the  present  state  of  the  contest 
between  the  computer  and  the  trader,  the  trader  still  has,  markedly,  the  upper 
hand.

An  important  use  of the  Parkinson  nur number is  the  assessment  of the  dis- 
tribution  of prices  during  the day as  well as  a better  understanding  of mar- 
ket  dynamics.  Comparing  the  Parkinson  number  and  the  periodically 
sampled  volatility  helps  traders  understand  the  mean  reversion  in the  mar- 
ket  as  well  as  the  distribution  of  stop-losses.  Some  clear  rules  can  be  de- 
rived  from  that  information. 

Comparing  the  Parkinson  number  P with  the  definition  of periodically 

sampled  historical  volatility  gives  this  result: 

P =  1.67  0’

It  means  that  the  volatility  of  the  market  as  observed  through  the  24 
hours  or  1 week,  or  any  stable  sampling,  period  should  be  related  (through 
the  distribution  of  the  maximum  and  the  minimum)  to  the  volatility  as 
measured  by the  extremes. 

Such  measurement  cannot  be  used  to  compare  close-to- 
Warning: 
close  volatility  with  intraday  high/low.  It  can  compare  24-hour 
high/low  to  data  sampled  every  day  at  the  same  time.  For  markets, 
like  most  equities,  which  trade  during  the  day  only,  it is  better  to  use 
open-to-close  volatility. 

This  estimator  can  give  meaningful  information  with  the  following  sit- 

uations: 

¢  Pricing  Barrier  Options  (and  the  related  American  digital  and  look- 
back  options).  They  get triggered  through  the  printing  of a  price  on 
the  screen;  therefore,  the  distribution  of the  extremes  is most  impor- 
tant.  The  barrier  option  trader  needs  only  one  information:  the  high 
or  the  low  to  see  if his  option  was  knocked-in  or knocked-out.  How 
this  extreme  is  distributed  matters  more  than  the  close-to-close  or 
any  other  estimator  of volatility.  The  Parkinson  number  is the  sole  in- 
formation.  If there  is  a  bias  making  the  P  consistently  higher  than 
1.67  o'  ,  the  trader  knows  that  the  probability  of hitting  the  trigger  is 
higher.  This  will  be discussed  later  in the book  with  reference  to bar- 
rier  options. 

¢  General  Option  Delta  Adjustments. 

The  comparison  between  the 
Parkinson  number  and  the  periodically  sampled  volatility  can  reveal 
serious  information  about  the  mean  reversion  of a  particular  market 
and  allow  the  trader  to  set  his  frequency  of adjustment  accordingly. 
(  If P is  higher  than  1.67  o’  the  trader  needs  to  hedge  a  long  gamma 
more  frequently.  Otherwise,  he  could  lag the  needed  adjustment,  a 
technique  called  “letting  the  gammas  run.”” 

°  General  Trading  Strategies. 

The  market  maker  edge  is  strongest  in 
cases  where P is higher  than  1.670".  It is otherwise  better  to  follow  a 
trend.  This  manifests  itself  (see  Chapter  4) in  a  negative  short-term 
autocorrelation  of prices. 

Figure  6.12  shows  the  Parkinson  number  ratio  to  the  volatility  during 
the  same  period  for the  U.S.  Treasury  bond  futures  over  a period  spanning 
almost  three  years  until  May  1995.  The  results  are  strikingly  convincing:

his  own  conclusions. 

Another  seminal  piece  of  work  (for  traders)  concerns  the  frequency  of 
sampling.  An  interesting  study  for  option  traders  is A.  Lo  and  A.  C.  MacKin- 
ley’s  paper’  on  a  particular  application  of a  technique  called  the  variance  ra- 
tios.  The  authors  intended  to  prove  that  stock  prices  have  a memory  through 
a simple  test  of variance  relative  to sampling  frequency.!° 

Briefly,  if the  volatility  on  an  hourly  sampled  basis  turns  out  to be higher 
than  the  volatility  on  a  daily  sampled  basis,  the  market  can  be  considered  as 
mean-reverting.  On  the  other  hand,  if the  market  showed a higher  volatility 
at  a  wider  frequency  between  the  dates  then  it can  be concluded  that  there  is 
a  trend.  More  powerful  tests  were  later  invented'!  but  this  simple  variance 
ratio  is simple  enough  for  traders  to  use  and  understand. 

For  example,  if the  market  moved  by 1%  per  day,  it would  be  expected 
that  over  20  business  days  it moved  by V20  =  4.47%.  Otherwise  something 
suspicious  would  be  deemed  to  be  taking  place,  such  as  the  market  moving 
more  often  one  way  than  the  other. 

What  traders  usually  notice  is  the  higher  volatility  when  sampled 
hourly,  especially  in  such  markets  as  the  SP500  and  the  Eurodollars.  This 
happens  regardless  of  the  ratio  between  the  volatilities  for  longer  periods, 
such  as  1 day and  higher. 

The  variance  ratio  is well  known  by traders,  even  by those  who  have  never 
heard  of  the  method  (see  Figure  6.13).  Often  stock  traders  wonder  why  the 
broad  market  moved  during  1995  by close  to  35%  with  historical  volatility 
close  to  10%,  or  why  the  dollar  lost  periodically  20%  of its  value  every  year 
during  the  1980s  without  volatility  being  any  higher  than  the  teens.’

THE  REAL  WORLD  AND  THE 
BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON  ASSUMPTIONS 

Risk  Management  Rule:  Dynamic  Hedging  with  Black-Scholes-Merton. 
It is better  to  improve  on  a  simple  but  seasoned  model  than  operate 
with  a  more  advanced  but  newer  model. 

It is better  to  use  a  model  with  the  smallest  number  of parame- 

ters  to  estimate. 

Better  models  often  create  nightmares.  Every  options  trader  and  risk  man- 
ager,  while  reaping  the  benefits  of the  contributions  of Black,  Scholes,  and 
Merton,  needs  to  spend  his  time  working  around  the  assumptions  that 
needed  to  be  made  for  the  model  to  stand.’  Indeed,  all  experienced  traders 
operate  under  the  same  model  and  are  comfortable  with  it  because  they 
have  learned  the  necessary  tricks  to  make  it work (Despite the  criticisms  of 
the  formula,  traders  have  refused  alternatives  because  they have  learned  its  - 
limitations.  No  experienced  trader  would  willingly  trade  Black-Scholes- 
Merton  for  another  pricing  tool. 

_ 

Black-Scholes-Merton  as  an  Almost  Nonparametric 
Pricing  System 

With  the  model,  we  are  able  to  get a  unified  measure  of the  price  of an  op-  , 
tion.  Traders  can  build  from  there  by introducing  the  additional  parameters 
as  an  informal  tacked-on  improvement,  such  as  the jump  factor,  volatility  of 
volatility,  correlation  between  asset  price  and  interest  rates,  and  different 
statistical  estimates  of  the  underlying  process.  With  most  exotic  options, 
the  need  to  parametrize  may  be more  pronounced. 

109 

110 

Measuring  Option  Risks 

Option  Wizard:  The  Essence  of Black-Scholes-Merton 

The  essence  of  the  model*  is  risk-neutral  replication  of securities  in  a  market 
that  is  said  to  be  complete.  It  does  not  mean,  however,  that  every  security 
needs  to  be  replicated  by every  arbitrageur,  as  has  often  been  misinterpreted. 
For  example,  with  a  warrant  on  a  Japanese  stock,  the  operators  involved  in 
such  arbitrage  cannot  dynamically  replicate  it  because  of  frequent  difficulties 
in  shorting  the  stock.  It does  not  mean,  however  that  fair  value  needs  to  be  dif- 
ferent  since  the  replication  costs  hamper  arbitrageurs.  Black-Scholes-Merton 
does  not  require  for  every  operator  to  be  delta  neutral  in  infinitesimal  changes 
in  the  stock  price.  Some  invisible  passive  replicator  would  trade  the  warrant  for 
the  stock  back  and  forth. 

Another  problem,  however  is that  an  operator  may  need  to  hold  a  security 
until  expiration.  To  reach  his  decision  to  buy the  security,  he  will  have  to  use  a 
term  variance  that  is different  from  the  infinitesimal  variance  of the  security. 

Just  as  the  value  of some  options  can  be  thought  of as  limit  decomposition 
of  others  with  the  full  knowledge  that  such  value  would  not  be  attainable 
through  replication,  we  can  consider  the  Black-Scholes-Merton  fair  price  as  the 
limit  of the  risk-neutral  arbitrage. 

*Advanced  topic. 

With  risk  management,  another  issue  appears:  that  of  the  accuracy  of 
the  Black-Scholes-Merton  predicted  changes  in  price.  Traders  have  to  work 
around  derivatives  of  the  formula,  building  modifications  that  range  from 
the  simple  rules  of thumb  to  the  more  complete  multifactor  models. 

at 

Black-Scholes-Merton  is  based  _on five assumptions,  The  first  two  are 
fundamental  (are  philosophically  of the  essence  of  the  model);  the  next 
three  are  parametric  or  distributional  (can  be  altered  without  any  signifi- 
cant  change  in the  model): 

1.  Ito  Process  (fundamental).  It  is  characterized  by a  random  component 
that  is  independent  and  identically  distributed  (as  described  ear- 
lier—the  Brownian  motion).  Its  principal  characteristic is  that  it needs 
to  be  memoryless.  The  notion  of continuous  prices  is not  as  relevant as~ 
it was  made out to  be  by early  detractors  of  Black-Scholes-Merton: 
Continuous  finance is  a  tool,  not  a  philosophical  statement. 

2.  Frictionless  Markets  (fundamental).  There  are  no  transaction  costs,  no 
costs  of  adjustment,  no  stamp  tax,  or  exchange  controls. 
(This  as- 
sumption  added  to  the  previous  one  implies  that  the  operator  can 
buy  and  sell in large  quantities  to  adjust  the  delta) It leads  to  total

absence  of the  impact  of utility  functions.  The  existence  of transac- 
tion  costs  would  necessarily  change  the  argument  for  a  hedging  pol- 
icy of an  isolated  operator,  but  it would  not  impact  fair  value. 

3.  Constant  Volatility  (parametric  assumption).  It  implies  that  the  daily 
variations  are  drawn  from  the  same  distribution  and  that  the  vari- 

ance  is  known.  It  leads  to  a  constant  correlation  between different

assets.” 

4.  Geometric  Brownian  Motion  (distributional  assumption).  It implies  (see 
Module  B  and  Chapter  10)  that  the  motion  of  assets  is  “geomet- 
ric: —that  the expected variance of  the  logarithms  of  the  returns 

5.  Constant  (and a Drift  (parametric  assumption),  In  trader’s  terms, 

the  structure  of the  forw ards s  slope  i is constant. 

eS  re 

A series  of corrections  will  be  made  to  reduce  the  impact  of these  assump- 
tions.  First,  it is necessary  to  gauge  the  cost  to  traders: 

—_ 

¢  (Assumption  1 needs  to  be lifted  in cases  of serious  path dependency,  ) 
as  with  liquidity  holes,  particularly  if the  manufacturing  of  the  op- 
tion  might  impact  the  path  of the  underlying  asset  (e.g.,  as  for  port- 
folio  insurance). 

°  Cees 2, sometimes  weakened,  means  that  option  traders  can- 
t adjust  their  delta  every  microtick  change  in  the  price  of  the  un- 
derlying’ Less  frequent  rebalancing  of  the  portfolio  implies  less 
tracking  of theoretical  value  per  trade  but  only  in  the  long  run.  Thus 
the  operator  would  have  to  start  divorcing  theoretical  value  and  dy- 
namic  replication{It  means  that  value  can  be obtained  from  continu- 
ous  time  finance  but  the  delta  needs  to  be  discretely  computed.? 

e  Assumption  3 is perhaps  easiest  to correct.  Volatility  is unstable  since 
make markets  in  it (one  can  buy or  sell  volatility).  This  leads 
‘traders 
to  a  divorce  between  historical  and  implied  volatility.  The  instability 
of volatility  causes  the  delta  to  lose  its  quality  of hedge  ratio  (unless 
properly  modified),  and  the  gamma  its  predictability  of  changes  in 
delta.  However,  sometimes  the  trader’s  work  will  be  made  easy  by 
awareness  of  some  link  between  volatility  changes  and  magnitudes 
of market  moves.  Such  information  is included  in this  text.  Moreover, 
because  the  volatility  is not  constant,  a  volatility  curve  results  and  as- 
Sumptions  must  be made  about  the  behavior  of such  curve.) 

¢  Assumption  4 will  be discussed  in Chapter  11.  In some  cases,  the  dis- 
tribution  might  be  considered  arithmetic,  as  with  Bachelier’s  early 
work.

e  Assumption  5 has  two  results.  The  first  is that  indeed  the  rate  of drift 
moves  (interest  rates  are  far  from  constant),  and  it is often  correlated 
with  the  movement  in the  asset  prices  (in “biased”  assets  like  Mexico 
the  link  is obvious).  The  second  result  is  that  the  drift  does  not  move 
in parallel,  but  in a  predictable  manner.

Option  Wizard:  Why  Good  Models  Die 

Most  new  models  that  attempted  to  correct  the  failings  of  Black-Scholes- 
Merton  did  not  survive.  An  admirable  and  realistic  one,  Merton’s  jump 
diffu- 
sion pricing  tool,  is  rarely  implemented  for  the  simple  reason  a ‘it  requires 
the. estimation  of two  additional  parameters,  the  Poisson  jump  size and its  fre- 
quency. .  Stochastic  volatility  techniques  (see  Hull and White,  1987)  also  were 
undesérvedly  consigned  to  the  dustbin  of business  school  libraries  because  of 
the  need  to  estimate  two  additional  parameters,  volatility  of volatility  and  the 
Correlation  between  the volatility  and  some  indicator of the  asset price.) The 
same problems  mar  the  implementation  of potent yield  curve  models,  ach as 
those  fitting  the  Heath-Jarrow-Morton  framework;  traders  tend  to  avoid  them 
despite  the  insistence  of  their  research  staff,  in  favor  of  the  simple  Black- 
Scholes-Merton  that  they  know  how  to  trick. 

Traders  are  not  fooled  by the  Black-Scholes-Merton  formula:  The  existence 
of  a  “volatility  surface”  is  one  such  adaptation.  But  they  find  it  preferable  to 
fudge  a  parameter,  namely  volatility,  and  make  it a  function  of time  to  expiration 
and  strike  price,  rather  than  have  to  precisely  estimate  another.

Adapting  Black-Scholes-Merton: 
The  Delta 

It  is  always  preferable  to  be  roughly  hedged  against  a  broad  set  of eventualities 
than  exactly  hedged  against  a  narrow  parameter. 

Marty  O’Connell 

@  Delta  means  the  sensitivity  of a  derivative  price  to  the  movement  in the 
underlying  asset.  It  is  either  expressed  in  percentages  or  in  total 
amounts.  A  50%  delta  is  supposed  to  mean  that  the  derivative  is  half 
as  sensitive  as  the  asset  and  that  one  needs  two  dollars  in  face  value  of 
the  derivative  to  replicate  the  behavior  of one  dollar  of the  asset. 

A delta  is expressed  as  the  first  mathematical  derivative  of the  product  with 
respect  to  the  underlying  asset.  It  means  that  it  is  the  hedge  ratio  of  the 
asset  for an  infinitely  small  move.  Somehow,  when  the  portfolio  includes  more 
than  one  option,  with  a  combination  of  shorts  and  longs,  delta  and  hedge 
ratio  start  parting  ways. 

The  delta  is not  necessarily  limited  to  options  and  contingent  claims.  It 
can  be  used  for  forwards,  futures,  and  other  linear  products,  where  its  ac- 
curacy  is  greater.  Linear  means  nondynamically  hedged,  and  dynamic_ 
hedging  is what  makes  the  delta  very  murky.  The  delta for a forward  would 
take into account  the discounting of the  cash  flow  to  achieve  equivalence  to 
a  cash  product. 

Perhaps  the  largest  misconception  in  the  financial  markets  attends  the 
definition  and  meaning  of  the  delta.  Every  operator  instinctively  knows 
that  hedging  in  continuous  time  will  never  be possible.  The  difference  between 
discrete  and  continuous  swells  when  one  looks  at  special  situations  such  as 
a  risk-reversal  or  barrier  options. 

Attempting  to  give the  delta  a meaning  in terms  of risk  management  is 
denying  the  dynamic  interaction  of  parameters.  It  partakes  of  the  desire 
by nonprofessionals  to  get  a numerical  exposure  at no  cost.  Nothing  can  be 
schematized  in  dynamic  markets.(Delta  loses  in  its  significance  when 
traders  move  from a simple  option  to  a  portfolio  of longs  and  shorts.  Many 
traders  to  this  day  live  under  a  delta  limit  rather  than  a  more  global  sce- 
nario  analysis.

CHARACTERISTICS  OF  A  DELTA 

Figure  7.1  shows  the  delta  for  a  simple  strategy.  The  call  with  100  strike 
price  is priced  at  15.7%  volatility,  the  delta  is originally  50.  It appears  to  be 
the  tangent  to  the  option  price,  and  shows  the  slope  of the  price  change  at 
the  origin,  100. 

In  the  case  of Figure  7.2  it is easy  to  ascertain  that  the  delta  in  fact  is a 
hedge  about  the  origin,  100,  and  that  the  hedge  would  need  some  adjust- 
ment  where  we  see  a  gap  between  the  slope  and  the  price  curve. 

THE  CONTINUOUS  TIME  DELTA  Is  Nor 
ALWAYS  A  HEDGE  RATIO 

The  delta  generally  interpreted  to  mean  an  equivalent  spot  position  be- 
comes  inapplicable  to  the  management  of a  portfolio.  Seasoned  profession- 
als  ignore  the  current  definition  of the  delta  as  both  a  measure  of risk  and 
an  indication  of  a  position  equivalence  (although  their  research  depart- 
ments  and  textbook-trained  risk  managers  usually  do not)  For any  thing  be- 
yond  a  medium-length  stable  option  close  to  the  money,  a  delta  does  not 
reflect  anything  meaningful. |

Option  Wizard:  The  Half  Billion-Dollar  Delta 

The  problems  with  the  meaning  of  a  delta  are  compounded  with  barrier 
options. 

An  interesting  illustration  of  this  microscopic  change  is  an  argument  that 
reportedly  took  place  (at  a  major  institution)  between  a  risk  manager  and  a 
group  of  traders  concerning  barrier  options.  The  risk  manager  (characteristi- 
cally  suspicious  of traders’  explanations)  was  vetoing  the  trade  on  grounds  that 
the  delta  reached  10,000%  at  the  barrier.  According  to  his  logic,  it would  put 
the  position  at  much  above  any  limit  allowable  by the  firm,  a  $5  million  trade 
hitting  the  equivalent  position  of half  a  billion!  So  he  prevented  the  trader  from 
engaging  in  the  transaction. 

The  trader  was  infuriated  by such  logic.  His  maximum  risk  on  the  trade  was 
less  than  $400,000  if everything  went  wrong.  True,  the  delta  jumped  to  abnor- 
mal  proportions  between  1.399999999  and  1.40  but  without  being  branded 
as  a  heretic  it was  difficult  to  explain  to  the  semi-mathematician-risk  manager 
that  deltas  sometimes  were  an  irrelevant  waste  of computer  power. 

According  to  the  formula,  the  trader  needed  to  buy a half  billion  dollars 
around  the  barrier  and  then  sell  them  back  at  or  above  it to  make  the  transition 
smooth.  If this  maneuver  were  feasible,  it would  make  barrier  options  better  in- 
struments  to  trade.  Leaving  the  trade  alone,  and  considering  it as  a  single  bet 
with  a  positive  expected  return,  appears  to  be  a  more  conservative  approach. 
In  that  light,  the  delta  bears  no  true  meaning.  Some  traders  trick  the  delta  of a 
barrier  by changing  the  expiration  date,  as  we  will  see  in  Chapter  20.

Orthodox  definition  of the  delta: 

0F 
7 
Delta:  == 

elta= 

F is the  derivative  F(U,f) 
U is the  underlying  security... 

It  is  the  derivative  of  the  option  price  to  the  underlying.  In  plain  En- 
glish,  it would  correspond  to  changes  in the  option  price  stemming  from  in- 
finitely  small  changes  in  the  underlying  asset.  This  concept  is  extremely 
useful  for  mathematical  derivations.  From  a  standpoint  of trading,  it offers 
no  significance,  for  the  following  reasons: 

e  There  is no  such  thing  as  an  infinitely  small  move  in  the  market. 
e 

If there  were  such  microscopic  moves  they  would  be  nobody’s  con- 
cern. 

To  make  the  mathematical  continuous-time  finance  delta  relevant,  it 
needs  to  be  accompanied  by the  second  derivative,  the gamma,  and  at  least 
a  third  one,  the  DgammaDspot.  In  addition,  because  volatility  tends  to 
change  when  markets  move,  adding  the  vega  to,the  exposure  would  be nec- 
essary. 

In  the  real  world,  the  modified  delta  notion  appears  to  be  a  more  ade- 

quate  measure.  It is defined  as: 

AF 
a, 
Modified  delta  =  —— 

Odiflea 

deltas 

with  the  A as  the  change  in option  price  stemming  from  a  set  change  in the 
underlying  security.  If the  call  price  picks  up  .05  points  when  the  underly- 
ing asset  moves  from  100  to  100.1  then  its  delta  will  be  .05/.10  =  .50  or  50%. 
However,  moving  the  asset  in  one  direction  (up)  is  not  necessarily  a 
great  approximation  of  the  behavior  of  the  function  on  the  way  south  as 
well.  A more powerful  tool  is to  use  the  following:

Delta

with  AU”  and  AU”,  respectively,  down-moves  and  up-moves  in  the  under- 
lying  asset. 

One  can  see  the  results  of such  derivation:  Delta  would  then  depend  on 
the  magnitude  of the  changes  in the  underlying  security,  that  is the  AU.  The 
increment  becomes  then  at  the  discretion  of the  operator.  It could  be  a  func- 
tion  of either  his  utility  curve  or  his  estimation  of future  volatility.

The  advantages  of using  the  discrete  delta  is that  it incorporates a little 
of the  second  and  third  derivatives  that  should  complete  the  mathematical 
delta  in any  form  of analysis. 

Example.  A  Misleading  Delta:  Assume  there  is  a  flat  yield  curve  and 
that  the  forward  is equivalent  to  spot. 

All  options  are  European  and  have  a  one-month  maturity. 

The  option  trader  has  the  following  position: 

¢  He  is long $1 million  of the  96  calls  (delta  .824,  total  continuous  delta 

$824,000  long). 

e  He  is  short  $1  million  of  the  104  calls  (delta  .198,  total  continuous 

delta  $198,000  short). 

¢  His  total  continuous  delta  is long $626,000. 
¢  He  could  hedge  it by selling  $626,000  of forward. 

Table  7.1  shows  his  performance.  Table  7.1  shows  the  delta  of  the  position 
positive  everywhere  except  around  100. 

It is apparent  that  the  P/L  on  display  in Figure  7.2  is similar  to  that  of a 
simple  long position,  except  around  the  origin—and  the  origin  is something

nobody  cares  about.  At  an  option  seminar,  when  the  author  asked  the 
crowd  whether  they considered  the  graph  to  reflect  a  long,  square,  or  short 
position,  all  the  traders  answered  “long.”  Characteristically,  the  persons 
without  trading  experience  answered  “square.” 

The  following  paradox  is taking  shape:  The  trader  in  the  example  buys 
$550,000  cash  instead  of $626,000.  The  answers  of the  seminar  participants 
who  were  shown  Figure  7.3  were  distributed  between  “square,”  “short,” 
and  a  few  “long”: 

¢  Those looking  at  the  extremes  (asset  price  93  or  107)  saw  a  positive 
P/L  in a rally  and  a  negative  one  in  a  selloff.  The  position  in  their 
eyes  “felt  long.” 

¢  Those  looking  at  a  narrow  range  (asset  price  ranging  between  99  and 

101)  “felt  short.” 

¢  Those  looking  at  a  middle  range  (asset  price  95  or  103)  “felt  squarish.” 

It can  be  seen  that  the  hedge  shown  in  Figure  7.3  and  Table  7.2  is more 
effective  than  the  first  one  for  wider  variations:  Maximum  loss  drops  to 
—65  from  —122.  Maximum  profit  drops  to  107  from  171.  Using  a  broad  set 
of assumptions,  Position  2 is more  delta  neutral  than  Position  1 although  it 
seems  delta  short.  For  a  A  of 2.5  points,  the  maximum  is  entirely  neutral. 
Taking  this  position  thus  widened  the  neutrality  increment  to  what  ap- 
peared  to  be a  decent  margin.

Had  the  author  asked  the  seminar  participants:  “How  would  you  feel  if 
there  was a threat  of a  nuclear  attack?”  they would  no  doubt  have  answered 
“long.”  And  to  the  question  “If your  time  frame  were  six  minutes?”  the  an- 
swer  would  have  been  “short.”  This  leads  to  the  following  rule: 

Risk  Management  Rule:  A  delta  depends  on  the  operator’s  per- 
ception  of  future  volatility  and  his  utility,  as  well  as  his  possible 
frequency  of adjustments. 

These  elements  matter  less  and  less  when  the  market  gains  in 

liquidity. 

Operators  are  forced  to  define  the  delta  as  a  function  of  increments  that 
matter  to  them.  The  preceding  position  would  appear  square  if the  P/L  cor- 
responded  to  pennies,  but  it  would  require  attention  if it  corresponded  to 
millions.  Somehow,  operators  are  obligated  to  let  the  utility  curve  creep  up 
into  their  trading.’ 

DELTA  AS  A  MEASURE  FOR  RISK 

Delta  fails  adequately  to  measure  risks  even  taking  a  simple  position.  It pro- 
vides  the  same  measure  to  an  extremely  risky  position  and  an  extremely 
safe  one.

The  trades  displayed  in  Figures  7.4  and  7.5  both  have  the  same  delta: 
$200,000  approximately.  It is easy  to  see  why  the  delta  is a  poor  approxima- 
tion  of risk. 

CONFUSION:  DELTA  BY  THE  CASH  OR  BY  THE  FORWARD 

The  delta  as  expressed  by the  Black-Scholes-Merton  formula  concerns  the 
amount  of cash  the  operator  needs  to  execute  to  offset  an  option  position. 
For  all  European  options,  however,  the  real  exposure  lies  in  the  forward. 

Nevertheless,  operators  prefer  to  see  the  cash  delta  as  they  generally 
hedge  themselves  with  it. It is easier  to monitor  on  a  screen  and  quote  in the 
market.  When  they  deal  with  options  on  futures  or  use  the  futures  as  a 
hedge,  they need  to  use  a  different  delta  fit to  the  exact  period  in the  future. 
The  difference  between  the  two  is  sometimes  far  from  trivial.  Operators 
often  must  deal  with  questions  like  this  one:|An  option  that  is  close  to  the 
money  in  the  forward  trades  at  50%  delta.  What  is the  cash  delta? 

The  answer  is to  transform  the  potential  future  exposure  into  a  cash  ex- 
posure  through  the  delta  of a  forward.|This  can  be  done  by discounting  the 
forward  exposure  using  the  cash-future  growth  rate  as  a  discounting  factor. 
Therefore,  the  delta  of the  cash  will  be the  discounted  value  of that  number. 
The  discounting  method  will  depend  on  the  underlying  security  of the  op- 
tion,  as  will  be  described. 

DELTA  FOR  LINEAR  INSTRUMENTS 

It is necessary  to  examine  the  deltas  for  linear  instruments  both  as  a  hedge 
between  futures/forward,  or  even  futures  and  futures,  or  as  a  hedge  for 
any  of the  two  with  options  or  vice  versa. 

For  a  view  of  the  cash  and  carry  arbitrage  relationships,  traders  can 

read  DeRosa  (1992;  1996). 

Delta  for  a  Forward 

A  Non-Interest-Bearing  Asset. 
of a  forward  is: 

The  general  formula  for  the  computation

for  a  non-interest-paying  asset. 

F is the  forward,  S the  spot,  t the  time  to  expiration  (a shortcut  for  t —  f,), 

r the  domestic  rate,  rf the  foreign  rate,  d the  dividend  rate. 

124  Measuring  Option  Risks 

The  covered  interest  parity  arbitrage for- 
Foreign  Currency  Forwards. 
mula  is  (typically  the  first  and  often  only formula a trader learns—and 
needs): 

AF  =  or -  rf  s 

Aioveee  the  forward  does  not  immediately  deliver  the  profits  and 
losses.  The  operator  has  to  wait  until  the  settlement  day  to  earn  or  pay  the 
realized  sum.  It is easy  to  see  that  a  profit  on  a  one-year  forward  will  turn 
to  cash  one  year  from  now;  therefore,  the  value  of the  nominal  asset  should 
be  discounted  like  a  zero-coupon  bond. 

Thus,  the  P/L  generated  by the  forward  needs  to  be  discounted  back  to 

the  cash  using  the  usual  e”. 
. Therefore,  using  AS  as  move-in  spot: 

P/L  of Forward  =  e~  e* —*!  AS  =  eT!  AS 

Delta  of a  Forward  =  eT! 

Ironically,  only  the  foreign  rate  matters.  Even  more  ironically,  the  delta 
being  the discounted  foreign  rate,  there  is  some  relativism  as  far  as  the 
hedging.(Two  people  looking  at  the  same  forward  would  use  two  different 
hedge  ratios  based  on  their  home  currency) Module  C  on  the  numeraire 
problem,  provides  a  discussion  of the  issue: 

Foreign  Cross-Currency  Pairs. 
A  foreign  cross-currency  pair  is  a  contract 
to exchange  one  currency  for another  at a  determined  point  in the  future.  An 
example  would  be  sterling/DM  for  an  American  citizen,  or  sterling 
/ Dollar 
for  a  German  citizen.  Not  much  volume  is  generally  transacted  between 
these  pairs, but  by virtue  of the  multiplication  of the  combinations,  there  are 
too  many  of  them.  Some  traders  quote  Drachma/Australian  dollar  or 
Lira/New  Zealand  dollar  though  not  routinely  so. 

Example:  Assume  there  is Currency  1 and  Currency  2 with  the  spot  ex- 
pressed  in units  of Currency  2 per  Currency  1. The  forward  therefore  is: 

E=  el  =  1B)  S 

with  rl  the  rates  in Currency  1 and  r2 the  rates  in Currency  2. 

Now  the  trader  is confronted  with  the  currency  in which  the  profits 
and  losses  are  computed,  as  they will  determine  how  he would  discount 
the  hedge.  The  trader  has  the  choice  of using  Currency  1 or  Currency  2 
as  a  discounting  one.  This  difficulty  arises  because  unrealized  profits 
and  losses  from a sterling  /DM  trade  can  be  either  in sterling  or  in DM. 
The  trader  cannot  translate  unrealized  profits  and  losses  into  his  home

currency  without  incurring  a  foreign  exchange  exposure  in  one  of  the 
currencies. 

Discounting  the  hedge  would  give us: 

Delta  of aiHorward  =e  “~~! 

r  is  either  rl  or  r2,  whichever  the  trader  chooses  as  his  “anchor”  cur- 
rency  (the currency  in which  the  profits  and  losses  are  computed). 

For  a  stock  or  stock  index  that  continuously  pays

dividends  (something  that  naturally  does  not  exist  but  that  is  an  assump- 
tion),  the  delta  of a  forward  is the  same  as  with  the  foreign  currency  except 
that  the  trader  uses  the  dividend  rate  instead.  The  result  is: 

Delta  of Forward  =e  “e"  %'  =e  -# 

with  d the  dividend  rate. 

When  the  dividend  rate  is  not  continuous,  one  needs  to  use  the  exact 

payout  to  the  end  date. 

Delta  for  a  Forward-Forward 

The  forward-forward  can  be  easily  defined  as  an  arithmetic  sum  of  one 
long,  one  short  position  in  the  same  instrument  at  two  different  dates.  The 
complexity  sometimes  arises  from  the  lack  of equivalency  between  amounts 
(2 years  vs.  3 years  will  need  to  be  “tailed”  properly  to  account  for  the  pre- 
sent  value). 

Example: 
The  delta  is  the  difference  between  both  individual  deltas. 
Take  F1  and  F2  as  two  forwards  with  delivery  f1  and  #2.  The  forward- 
forward  will  therefore  be  called  F(f1,t2). 

The  delta  of F(t1,t2)  will  be  equal  to  Delta  F (#2)  —  Delta  F (#1). 
The  profits  to  t1  need  to  be  discounted  at  a  different  rate  than  the 
profits  to  t2.  In addition,  this  gives  rise  to  interpolation  issues  that  will 
cause  some  difficulties  in  determining  the  exact  rl  given  f1  and  r2 
given  2. 

A more  complex  approach  would  be  to  weigh  the  deltas  of each  for- 

ward  since  it is not  exactly  the  same  position. 

Delta  for  a  Future 

The  general  formula  for  the  computation  of a  future  is: 

Future  =  e” Spot 

for  a  non-interest,  non-dividend-paying  asset.

is:

¢  For  a  foreign  cross-currency,  the  same  holds.  Assume  there  is  Cur- 
rency  1 and  Currency  2 with  the  spot expressed  in units  of Currency 
2 per  Currency  1. The  forward  therefore  is: 

Delta  of a  Future  =  e  ~  2! 

¢  For  a  stock  or  stock  index  dividends,  continuously  paying  the  delta 
of a  forward  is similar  to  that  of the  foreign  currency  except  that  the 
dividend  rate  is used  instead.  The  result  is: 

Delta  of Future  =e  “, with d the  dividend  rate. 

When  the  dividend  rate  is not  continuous,  the  exact  payout  to  the  end  date 
is used. 

Stability  of  a  Delta  for  a  Linear  Derivative. 
The  deltas  of futures,  for- 
wards,  swaps,  and  the  like  are  stable  (since  they are  called  linear  deriva- 
tives). ‘Their second  derivatives  are  almost  equal  to zero  (i.e.,  no  gamma, 
except for  a  small  convexity)  and  they have  only  one  meaningful  first  deriv- 
ative,  the  delta.  No  modification  is  therefore  necessary  to  compensate  for 
the  shortcomings  of such  approximation,  except  in cases  of extreme  convex- 
ity in  very  volatile  markets. 

DELTA  AND  THE  BARRIER  OPTIONS 

( Often  dealers  have  their  palms  sweating  when  confronted  with  the  deltas 
close  to  10,000%  when  they come  close  to  the barrier  nearing  expiration  day) 
In  some  cases,  numbers  swell  beyond  the  screen’s  ability  to  display  the 
numbers.  This  issue  is  examined  more  closely  in  Chapters  19  and  20,  but 
often  this  jump  is only  applicable  for  a  small  increment. 

d It is  indeed  erroneous  to  try  to  hedge  according  to  that  schedule.  Get- 

ting rid  of that  notion  makes  barrier  options  easier  to  trade. ) 

Adapting  Black-Scholes-Merton:  The  Delta 

127 

Barrier  options  present  an  extreme  case  of discontinuity  that  is very  in- 
structive  for  convincing  anyone  about  the  flaws  of using  a  continuous  time 
framework  for  option  analysis. 

DELTA  AND  THE  BUCKETING 

M@  A  bucket  is  the  bundling  of  exposures  by  groups  of  neighboring 

maturities. 

Another  limitation  to  the  delta  measure  is that  it does  not  display  the  risks 
in  the  “basis”  or  the  risk  between  buckets.  The  delta  in  the  cash  is  some- 
times  insignificant  when  one  is  confronted  with  a volatile  basis  or  a  long 
time  separating  the  cash  from  the  future.  The  risk  manager  therefore  needs 
to  see  the  “bucketing.”  This  is due  to  the  volatility  of both  the  volatility  (it 
can  impact  back-month  deltas)  and  the  interest  and  carry  rates. 

DELTA  IN  THE  VALUE  AT  RISK 

The  reader  needs  to  review  a  more  thorough  explanation  of the  value  at risk 
(VAR)  concepts  in Module  E. A (poor)  method  of incorporating  of the  deriv- 
atives  risk  in  the  value  at  risk  method  is the  following”: 

Equivalent  position  =  face  value  x  (delta  x  expected  move 

+  5 gamma  (expected  move)’) 

In  the  case  of the  risk  reversal  in  the  Figure  7.1,  the  total  exposure  for 
such  a  position,  according  to  the  VAR,  would  then  be  zero.  Including  a 
gamma  did  not  help  much  since  the  gamma  is nil. 

Some  risk  managers  go  the  extra  mile  and  add  the  vega  to  the  analysis. 
Would  it improve  the  risk  measure  in  this  example?  Of  course  not:  Despite 
all  its  hidden  risks,  the  trade  is vega  neutral.  In  addition,  the  measurement 
needs  to  include  the  shadow  gamma  to  be  complete,  in  order  to  incorporate 
the  vega  of the  position.  At  the  time  of this  writing,  current  methods  for  as- 
sessing  the  risks  of  option  portfolios  resort  to  the  repricing  of  an  option 
portfolio  at  simulated  large  movements. 

DELTA,  VOLATILITY,  AND  EXTREME  VOLATILITY 

All  operators  in options  learn  that  a  rise  in volatility  would  cause  the  delta  of 
an  out-of-the-money  call  to  rise  and  that  of  an  in-the-money  call  to  drop, 

128 

Measuring  Option  Risks 

Option  Wizard:  Delta  and  the  Probability  of Being  in  the  Money 

(This  issue  is examined  in  greater  detail  in  Chapter  17.) 

The  delta  is the  “risk-neutral”  (see  Module  B)  replication  of the  option.  The 
value  corresponds  to  the  integral  of  the  payoffs  between  the  strike  price  and 
infinity  for  a  call  (or  zero  for  a  put)  assuming  the  underlying  process  is  risk- 
neutral.  In  discrete  terms,  it would  be  the  sum  of the  payoff  of every  eventuality 
multiplied  by its  risk-neutral  probability.  The  delta  is the  sensitivity  of that  value 
to  the  changes  in the  underlying  asset. 

More  practically,  it  corresponds  to  the  ratio  of  the  asset  the  trader  must 

carry  to  avoid  having  any  instantaneous  P/L  from  the  micromoves. 

The  probability  of ending  in the  money  is simply  the  discounted  probability 
divorced  from  the  associated  payoff.(In  the  study  of  binary options,  it will  be 
shown  that  the  delta  and  the  probability  of  being  in  the  money  would  be  the 
same  at  very  low  volatility  and  in  the  absence  of  a  skew,  and  would  start  di- 
verging  in  the  presence  of either  a  skew  or  a  high  volatility  (as  it could  cause  a 
right-side  skew,  owing  to  lognormality,  see  Figure  7.7). 

Barrier  option  traders  who  experience  deltas  in  500%  magnitudes  are  fully 
aware,  albeit  intuitively,  that  delta  means  replicating  quantity  not  probability. 
They  know  that  the  scary  delta  corresponds  to  the  amounts  to  buy  or  sell  to 
protect  their  book  from  losses  and  maintain  their  comfortable  lifestyle. 

We  can  also  extend  some  notions  from  the  two-country  paradox:  The 
probability  of  being  in  the  money  using  one  part  of  a  pair  as  a  numeraire  is 
the  delta  for  the  party  using  the  other  side  as  a  numeraire.  So  in  a  vanilla 
DEM-USD  option,  a  delta  for  a  USD-based  person  is the  probability  of being 
in  the  money  for  a  DEM-based  person.  This  striking  paradox  is  discussed  in 
Chapter  19  and  Module  C. 

therefore  bringing  deltas  closer  to 50%  (or the  present  value  of 50%,  to be pre- 
cise). 

In  the  formula,  as  shown  here,  asset  S follows  the  geometric  Brownian 

motion: 

)=  5, exp|(w=  807)  tA  VEZ) 

S, is  the  price  of  the  stock  at  time  0 (the  present), 
the  (risk-neutral)  drift 
(interest  rate  differential  or  numeraire  rates  less  carry),  o  the  volatility  and 
t time  until  expiration. 

Z  follows  a  reduced  centered  normal  distribution  such  as  p(z  =  x)  =

The  rise  in  volatility  has  the  tendency  to  increase  the  expected  final 
price  of the  stock  through  compounding,  while  the  drift  would  make  it de- 
crease  by .5 07 t. 

Table  7.3  shows  exactly  what  takes  place  when  we  calculate  the  asset 
price  on  a  spreadsheet.  He  assumes  that  t =  12%  of  one  year  and  plugs  in 
.12.  We  also  assume  that 
=  0 and  that  S, =  100.  The  volatility  (the first  col- 
umn)  is  expressed  in  annualized  terms  (to match  t, which  is  expressed  in 
annualized  terms  as  well). 

The  Z values  share  the  same  probability.  So if the  center  column  were  at 
100,  in  all  cases  the  expected  values  of  the  final  asset  S would  be  higher 
than  S,. There  is  a  correcting  term—.5  o°  f to  satisfy  the  martingale  prop- 
erty:  Every  cell  multiplied  by its  probability  needs  to  sum  up  to  S,. Note 
how  —.5  o* t pulls  down  the  market  in the  center  column  (Z =  0). 

The  compounding  is  caused  by what  is  called  the  geometric  return: 
Since  returns  compound,  a higher  volatility  would  raise  such  compounding 
and  would  increase  the  divergence  between  an  arithmetic  process  (where 
the  returns  are  constant)  and  a geometric  one  (where  the  returns  depend  on 
the  level  of  the  asset).  The  net  effect  between  these  two  counterbalancing 
factors  is the  thickness  of the  right  tails.  This  effect  will  be examined  again 
in Chapters  17  and  ee 7.6  shows  the  graph  of the  terminal  values  of 
S against  their  probability. 

At  a  higher  volatility,  as  shown  in  Figure  7.7, the  distribution  develops 
an  increasing  skew  to  the  right.  The  mean,  however,  remains  the  same:  The 
surfaces  on  each  side  of  100  are  equal.  It  means  that  the  median  needs  to 
slide  left  in  an  amount  commensurate  to  the  volatility  level.  This  shift  will 
have  an  effect  on  the  delta. 

Example: 
The  forward  trades  at  100,  spot  at  100.  Table  7.4  lists  the 
deltas  of  the  110  calls,  the  90  calls,  and  90  puts,  all  with  180  days  until 
expiration.  Assume  interest  is at  zero  for  simplification. 

Volatility  does  not  often  rise  to  180%.  An  nonequity  option  trader  would 
see  an  actively  liquid  instrument  do  so  only  once  every  few  years.  However, 
these  instances  provide  the  option  trader  with  an  accelerated  tutorial.

Brownian  motion  for  both,  which  is incoherent:  Both  yields  and  prices  can- 
not  be  lognormal  and  have a fat  right  tail  at  times  of high  volatility.  Aug- 
menting  this  contradiction  is  that  traders  often  mix  the  same  instruments 
in the  same  book.  Bond  futures,  for  example  (baring  the  embedded  outper- 
formance  option),  priced  on  a  log-Brownian  price,  are  mixed  with  bonds 
priced  on  a  log-Brownian  yield  and  put  together  as  hedges  in  the  same 
book.  This  incorrect  mixing  can  carry  serious  consequences  for  a  large book 
at  a  high volatility,  as  the  delta  difference  becomes  acute. 

The  delta  and  partial-delta  concepts  for  multivariate  options  will  be 

dealt  with  in Chapter  22.

Gamma  and  Shadow  Gamma 

One  day in  mid-1994,  the  dealing  rooms  in  the  United  States  were  rocked  with  the 
news  of the  bankruptcy  of a  hedge fund,  costing  a  minimum  of $600  million  to 
their  investors.  What  worried  the  community  was  that  the  blown-up  fund  was 
meant  to  be  “market  neutral.”  Market  neutrality,  it  had  appeared,  would  be  a 
great  panacea  in  the  volatile  world  of tightening  policy  and  distorted  relationship: 
In  theory  the fund  would  warehouse  cheap  securities,  hedge  them,  and  achieve 
above-average  returns  for the  Florida  residents. 

One  trader  was  asked  by his  manager  to  explain  the  results.  He  shouted: 

“That  guy  did  not  get the  second  derivative  right.” 

SIMPLE  GAMMA 

™  The  gamma  is  the  second  (mathematical)  derivative  of  the  derivative 
with  respect  to  the  asset  price.  It is  easily  calculated  analytically  with 
the  following: 

0°F 
ome 

Whe unevenness  of the  gamma  in space  (i.e.,  with  time  moving  and  the  asset 

NA price  remaining  constant)  has  these  effects: 

e  For  an  at-the-money  option,  the  gamma  is  maximum  when  the  op- 

tion  nears  expiration. 

e  For  an  out-of-the-money  option,  the  gamma  is  maximum  when  the 

option  is far  away  from  expiration. 

mA 

(This time dependence  of the oe has some  consequences  for  calendar 
spreading, 
as shown in Figure  8 If a trader  buys  option  A and  sells  option 
B,  the  gamma  will  be  positive  at  the  money  (Figure  8.1  shows  the  A  line 
higher  than  the  B line),  but  the  lines  cross  at some  level.  The  best  comparison 
is  between  a  short-distance  runner  and  a  marathon  runner.  The  marathon 
runner  would  win  the  long-distance  race.  The  short-distance  runner  would 
win  a  100-meter  dash.  In  between,  there  is a  race  of a  certain  length  where 
they would  be of equal  speed.

Figure  8.1  suggests  there  are  important  pitfalls  for  option  replication 
and  portfolio  stabilization:  Often  operators  hedge  their  gamma  with  an  op- 
tion  trade  that  takes  care  of their  immediate  need  (defined  in  a  narrow  re- 
gion  around  the  origin)  but  does  not  provide  long-term  stability  to  the 
position.  They  look  at  their  gamma  reports  and  buy  the  exact,  necessary 
protection;  such  protection  might  be  short-lived  in a bursting  market. 

Risk  Management  Rule:  A  range  needs  to  be  associated  with 
every  gamma  measurement. 

GAMMA  IMPERFECTIONS  FOR  A  BOOK 

More  even  so  than  the  delta,  the  gamma  measure  is often  too  narrow  to  dis- 
play  the  results  of  the  actual  move  in  a  logical  increment.  For  a  book,  this 
measure  loses  in  accuracy  because  the  multiplication  of options  causes  the 
gamma  to  increase  in  “locality”  —to  depend  more  and  more  on a particular 
spot  range.|A  gamma  could  be  long  at  100,  short  at  101.65,  long  again  higher. 
and  so  forth,  according  to  which  structure  dominates  at  a  given  spot  point. 
A practically  sound  way  to  measure  the  gamma  is to  vary  the  underly- 
ing price  and  calculate  the  actual  change  in hedge  ratio  over  the  increment. 
The  operation  needs  to  be performed  twice: 

1.  To  display  the  “up-gamma”  by moving  the  price  north  and  comput- 

ing the  change  in delta. 

2.  To  display  the  “down-gamma”  by moving  the  price  south  and  com- 

puting  the  change  in delta.

Option  Wizard:  More  Pitfalls  for  Risk  Managers 

Risk  managers  without  market  experience  commonly  blame  traders  for  incor- 
porating  the  third  derivative  in  the  analysis.  However,  traders  need  to  use  as 
powerful  a  measure  at  all  stages  of  the  game  even  if  their  designation  of 
“gamma”  could  embrace  more  than  its  theoretical  scope.  Traders  call  delta 
something  that  has a little  gamma  in  it and  gamma  something  that  has a little 
Ddelta-Dvol  in  it.

Averaging  both  and  coming  up  with a total  aggregate  is deceiving.  Ina 
risk  reversal  (see following  definition)  situation,  the  gamma  will  be positive 
one  way  and  negative  the  other.  Netting  the  two  would  show  the  gamma 
to  be  deceivingly  square.  Using  the  up-gamma  and  down-gamma  would 
display  the  third-order  risk. 

MW Risk reversal  is  any  position  that  has  an  up-gamma  over  some  incre- 

ment  of a  different  sign  than  the  down-gamma. 

Example.  A Regular  Option: 
The  trade  is  long  $2,000M  of  the  110  calls 
with  1 month  to  go.  The  initial  delta  is  $36M  and  the  trader  goes  delta 
neutral  (a small  1.8%).  Volatility  is 15.7%.  Table  8.1  shows  the  up-gamma 
and  down-gamma  changes.  Anyone  looking  at  Figure  8.2  can  see  the  in- 
stability  of  the  rate  of  change  of  the  delta.  This  is  manifested  for  every 
point  by a  difference  between  an  up-gamma  and  a  down-gamma. 

The  classical  example  shown  in Figure 
Example.  Case  (Risk  Reversal): 
8.3  shows  that  the  gamma  needs  to be measured  with  respect  to  the  ori- 
gin (Table  8.2).

CORRECTION  FOR  THE  GAMMA  OF  THE 
Back  MONTH 

Often  the  calendar  spreading  gives  rise  to  two  different  levels  of gamma:  a 
long  gamma  in  one  maturity  against  a  short  gamma  in  another  one.  This 
may  be  stable  except  that  the  two  maturities  might  not  have  the  same  vari- 
ance,  since  the  “basis,”  or  the  difference  between  cash  and  futures  might 
be  positively  correlated  to  the  cash,  which  would  lead  to  unequal  moves 
between  forwards.  In  that  case,  the  static  analysis  of the  gamma  would  be 
misleading.

A  correction  is  necessary  because  the  Black-Scholes-Merton  does  not 
allow  for  the  rates  moving.  The  following  simplified  example  shows  such 
adjustment. 

Example: 
This  is  a  simple  calendar  spread  between  two  different  ma- 
turities  in  the  SP500  contracts  on  the  Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange

First  Adjustment 

The  back  month  could  have  a  lower or  higher  volatility  exposure  than  the 
front  owing  to  the  present  valuing.(When  the future  curve  trades at a dis- 
count (i.e., the  back  month is  lower  than  the  front), one  unit  of the commod- 
ity in  6-month  maturity  would  be  less  than  one  unit  of  the  commodity  in 

138  Measuring  Option  Risks 

3-month  maturity;  one  contract  in  6 months’  worth  of  exposure  becomes 
smaller  than  the  3-month  one.)  When  the  future  trades  at  a  premium,  the 
opposite  effect  is  expected.  However,  such  effect  is  weak  and  swamped  by 
other  factors  affecting  the  volatility  of the  back-month  contract. 

Second  Adjustment 

The  back  month  can  also  have  a  higher  or  lower  gamma  owing  to  the  stabil- 
ity of the  basis  (the  cash-future  relationship). 

- 

There  are  multiple  methods  to  check  the  volatility  of  the  back  month 

relative  to  the  front: 

e  Single-factor  method:  It  consists  in  using  the  relative  volatilities  of 
every  month.  The  6-month  can  be  more  or  less  volatile  than  the  1- 
month  and  the  trader  would  discount  the  gamma  accordingly. 

¢  Another  method,  more  complicated,  can  be  derived  by construction. 
It  involves  the  use  of  a  covariance  matrix  of  the  forward  curve.  Its 
basic  methodology  is covered  in Chapter  12. 

Ori the  preceding  example,  the  operator  discovered  empirically  that 
March  had  12%  more  volatility  than  September.  It  means  that  whenever 
September  moved  by  1 point,  March  moved  by 1.12  points.  The  operator 
needed  to  be  hedged  for  such  discrepancy.  He  therefore  computed  the 
gamma  by multiplying  it by 1.12  to  get 65  gammas  instead  of 58. 

Risk  Management  Rule:  Gammas  of  different  maturities  cannot 
be compared  without  proper  adjustment. 

This  point  will  be discussed  further  in Chapter  12. 

SHADOW  GAmMMa! 

Often  the  gamma  itself  means  nothing  as  the  position  is sensitive  to volatil- 
ity changes  (or  skew  prices)  and  requires  richer  analysis  techniques.  This 
necessitates  the  embedding  of  the  expected  effect  on  other  factors  deter- 
mined  by the  move  (such  as  volatility  or  sometimes  interest  rates). 

Most  practitioners  commit  the  basic  mistake  of running  their  positions 
without  taking  into  account  that  moves  in  the  underlying  asset  are  linked 
to  changes  in other  elements  in the  market.  Jumps  in the  market  invariably 
lead to jumps in volatility. 
A gamma  number that does-not 
factor this ele- 
ment  would  be meaningless.  SS  oe)  fees. 

Gamma  and  Shadow  Gamma 

139 

Risk  Management  Rule:  Whatever  can  be  predicted  with  confi- 
dence  needs  to  be  incorporated  in  the  risk  analysis.  Ignoring  them 
would  make  the  Greek  measures  an  entirely  theoretical  workout. 

This  does  not  conflict  with  the  desire  to  keep  Black-Scholes-Merton. 
Predicting,  not  modeling,  is  recommended  since  predicting  allows  the 
trader  to  change  his  mind  while  modeling  freezes  the  opinion  into  an  inex- 
tricable  apparatus  of estimators. 

wa Shadow  gamma  is the  computation  of the  forecast  changes  in  delta  tak- 
ing into  account  the  changes  in volatility  and  its  impact  on  the  position 
(Figure  8.4,  Table  8.3).  The  position  is  then  reevaluated  using  new 
volatility  parameters. 

Example:  A trader is  long  the  wings  (1.e.,  long out  of money  options). 
He  estimates  that  volatility  should  rise  if the  market  moves  away  drasti- 
cally,  in  any  direction.  (For  simplification,  assume  that  the  asset  is par- 
allel  and  that  up-moves  in  the  underlying  would  cause  the  same 
changes  in  parameters  as  down-moves.)  He  would  like  to  capitalize  on 
that  effect  when  the  option  markets  are  closed  by trading  the  gamma 
overnight. 

Make  the  initial  assumption  that  at  98  or  102  the  volatility  will  be 

one  point  higher. 

At  98.00  overnight  in  the  future,  the  trader  can  buy 731  units  of un- 
derlying  instead  of  645.  At  102  overnight,  he  can  sell  698  units  of  the 
underlying  instead  of 612.

So  the  trader  can  sell  more  futures  in the  rally,  buy more  in the  sell- 
off.  The  real  gamma  is  stronger  than  in  a  one-factor  matrix.  While  the 
conventional  matrix  shows  an  up-gamma  of 292,  the  shadow  gamma  is 
337.  While  the  conventional  down-gamma  is  300,  the  shadow  down- 
gamma  is 346. 

The  shadow  gamma  works  both  ways:  By sticking  to  a  tighter  future  re- 
balancing,  the  short  gamma  hedger  can  thus  more  accurately  hedge  the 
changes  in the  P/L. 

For  a change  x%  in the  underlying?  if it is assumed  that  volatility  picks

nomial).

A  more  advanced  shadow  gamma  (see  Table  8.3)  consists  in  using  an 
exact  association  between  the  forwards  and  the  cash  and  project  more  ac- 
centuated  cash  moves.

The 
Example  (advanced).  Grid  of Expected  Volatility/Spot  Dependence: 
seasoned  option  trader  can  look  into  his  memory  and  assess  the  impact 
on  volatility  of  a  market  move.  The  result  is  the  volatility  map  (Table 
8.4).  Although  this  is nothing  but  a  forecast,  it is  generally  better  than 
the common  methods  of looking  at  moves  with  constant  volatility. 

it is undeniable that large moves,  especially  when they take place  after  a 
~iulet period, result in. higher volatility. It is also  undeniable  that volatility _ 
behavior  could  be  predicted  for  a  “biased”  asset  (asymmetrical  assets  that 
cause  anxiety  during  price  drops)  as  the  violent  moves  down  cause  an  in- 
considerable  measure  of panic.  The  trader,  therefore,  should  recompute  his 
P/L  at those  prices  and  try to  cover  with  the  delta  and  the  gamma  positions 
that  satisfy  his  risk  appetite. 

Note.  The  preceding  map  linking  expected  volatility  to  various  asset 
prices  could  be derived  from  option  prices  in the  market  with  the  skew  and 
smile  analysis  techniques.  The  market  cannot  be  fooled  for  too  long,  and  it 
discovered  that  large  moves  are  generally  accompanied  with  jumps  in 
volatility.  It also  believes  that  some  moves  (typically  rallies  in stock  indices) 
generally  take  place  with  excruciating  slowness  and  will  indicate  that  be- 
havior  through  option  prices.*

Threshold  Shadow  Gamma  is a  variation  of the  shadow  gamma  method.  It 
corresponds  to  the  belief  that  the  expected  change  in  volatility  is not  a  lin- 
ear  function  of  the  move  and  requires  the  use  of  schedules  of  moves.  (In- 
stead  of  using  mathematical  methods,  it  is  always  recommended  to  ask 
traders  to  draw  scenario  analyses.) 

Oana  GAMMA  AND  THE  SKEW 

With  biased  assets  (see Chapter  15) the  gamma  needs  to  take  into  account  the 
behavior  of volatility  and  the  movement  along  the  “skew  curve.’(If  there  is 
an  asymmetry  in  option  volatilities  between  the  upside  and 
downside 
strikes,  the  gamma  needs  to  take  into  account  that  the  volatility  of an  at-the- 
money  option  may  increase  or  decrease)  An  indication  of future  volatility 
can  be drawn  from  where  the  out-of-the-money  calls  and  puts  are  presently 
trading. 

Skew  gamma  is also  called  “asymmetrical  shadow  gamma.” 
A 

ee 

GARCH  GAMMA 

ARCH  is  a  volatility  modeling  method  that  traders  avoid  talking  about.  It 
corresponds  to  the  realization  by econometricians  that  volatility  moves  in 
clusters.  A  large  move  would  cause  another  large  move,  and  a  quiet  day  is 
likely  to  be  followed  by a  quiet  day.  To  traders,  there  was  nothing  remark- 
able  about  such  insights.  However,  ARCH  provided  the  framework  for  het- 
eroskedastic  thinking  in academia. 
_/GARCH  gamma  by Engle  and  Rosenberg  (1995)  is the  first  academic  dis- 
covery of shadow  gamma.  As  the  markets  move,  so  will  the  future  volatility, 
and  this  information  needs  to be incorporated  into  the  future  delta.  The  dif- 
ference  between  present  and  future  delta  is called  GARCH  gamma. 

Superficially,  GARCH  gamma  sounds  like  shadow  gamma.  However, 
shadow  gamma  does  not  make  any  statement  as  to  the  behavior  of  the 
future  market’s  actual  volatility,  whereas  GARCH  gamma  predicts  both  fu- 
ture  historical  and  implied  volatility.  Shadow  gamma  is  a  simple  heuristi- 
cally  obtained  forecast  of the  price  of options  as  a  deterministic  function  of 
the  path  taken  by the  underlying  securities. 

ADVANCED  SHADOW  GAMMA 

wa 

a Advanced  shadow  gamma  takes  into  account  the  trader’s  expected 
volatility  and  interest  (or carry)  rate  moves  that  accompany  the  changes 

Gamma  and  Shadow  Gamma

in the  asset  price.  In addition,  both  volatility  and  interest  rate  curves  are 
expected  to  shift  in a  nonparallel  way. 

Gore shadow  gamma  could  be  easily  used  in  a  commodity  that  has 
Oth its price  change  and  its  volatility  correlated  to  the  interest  rates.)Cur- 
rency  pairs  in which  there  is a  “weak”  side  often  present  such  difficulties. 
The  Mexican  peso  hardly  sells  off against  the  OECD*  currencies  without  a 
corresponding  defensive  rise  in  interest  rates  and  the  corresponding  in- 
crease  in  volatility.)  The  same  applies  to  the  currencies  in  a  “band”  (e.g., 
the  former  ERM)’ 
where  the  weak  parties  need  to  be  defended  with  pro- 
hibitively  high interest  rates  to  deter  the  speculators  and  other  scourges  of 
central  banks.  This  leads  to  the  necessity  of  running  the  forward  using 
more  complex  factors.  The  analysis  would  take  place  as  follows. 

If the  cash  currency  drops  by 10%  in  a  “biased”  asset,  in  addition  to 
the  rise  in the  volatility  the  operator  needs  to  forecast  some  increase  in the 
interest  rate  differential.  That  widening  in  the  differential  would  cause 
the  back  month  to  move  further  than  the  front  month.  Such  imbalance  cre- 
ates  additional  gamma  that  could  be  interpreted  as  higher  or  lower. 

Should  the  currency  experience  the  (unlikely)  rally  in  the  asset  price, 

the  interest  rate  differential  would  narrow  but  not  in  the  same  amount. 

Example:  Assume  the  existence  of the  imaginary  currency  of Syldavia. 
SYL-USD  is the  symbol  for  the  currency  pair. 

US  Dollar  Rd  (one  year)  =  6%. 

Syldavian  currency  Rf  =  20%. 

Spot price  =  100. 

The  one-year  forward  price,  satisfying  the  covered  interest  rate  par- 
ity formula  (100  x  Exp(.06  —  .20)),  would  trade  at  86.93. 

In a  crisis,  the  currency  drops  to  90.  Such  a  drop would  cause  the  in- 
terest  rates  in  the  Syldavian  capital  to  rise  by 2000  basis  points  (in the 
one-year)  (Figure  8.5).  As  a  result,  the  forward  is now  at 90  x  Exp (.06  — 
40)  =  62.79.  So  while  the  spot  fell  by 10  points  (10%),  the  one-year  for- 
ward  took a hit by 24.14  points  (27.75%). 

The  assumption  in  Table  8.5  is  that  the  trader  had  only  one  position  in 

his  portfolio,  one-year  options. 

More  precision  could  be  brought  into  the  model  by repeating  the  exer- 
cise  for  every  expiration  (e.g.,  the  6-month  and  the  2-years),  making  the 
same  forecast  then  assessing  the  total  impact  on  the  portfolio.

Syldavia  is a  country  that  faces  decisive  elections  as  it will  be  choosing  be- 
tween  an  anarchist  regime  or  a  Western  style  capitalist  one.  Six  months  be- 
fore  the  elections  were  announced,  when  Syldavia  was  a  quiet  country, 
volatility  was  at  a  boring  14%  for  all  maturities.  It is expected  to  return  to 
that  level  should  the  anarchists  lose.  For  some  reason,  financial  markets 
tend  to  prefer  Western  capitalism  and  dislike  the  anarchists. 

The  volatility  is presently  at 20%  in the  one-month  options,  declining  all 

the  way  to  16%  in the  one-year. 

To  simplify  the  case  study,  the  position  assumed  will  be  exclusively  in 
one-month  options.  The  trader  has  in  his  book  a  mixture  of  strikes,  as 
shown  in  Table  8.6.  The  results  of  the  ballots  are  due  in  one  hour  and  the 
trader,  trusting  no  polls,  imparts  no  true  probability  to  each  event.  The  Syl- 
davian  currency  presently  trades  at  100  to  the  dollar  with  interest  rates  at 
14%  against  6%  for  the  USD. 

The  trader  met  with  his  peers  and  came  up with  a  road  map  concerning 
the  outcome  of  the  elections  (Figure  8.6).  Using  this  road  map,  the  trader 
will  have  to  ignore  the  conventional  Greeks  and  limit  himself  to  the  analysis

of his  P/L  should  either  of  the  two  states  occur.  The  markets  will  go  from 
the  preelection  state  to  either  of  the  two  outcomes  without  any  trading  in 
between  so  the  idea  of delta  rebalancing  will  have  to  be  forgotten  for  now. 

Table  8.6  allows  the  trader  to  look  at  the  conventional  delta/gamma 

matrix  and  compare  it with  the  “true”  distribution. 

According  to  the  conventional  theoretical  Black-Scholes-Merton  delta 
notion,  the  trader  starts  with  neutrality  at 20%.  The  delta  shows  accordingly 
0 at the  delta  column  that  corresponds  to  the  combination  of 100  in the  asset 
price  and  20%  in the  volatility. 

There  is no  possible  trading  in between  the  states  so  the  trader  will  have 
to  derive  the  shadow  deltas  and  gammas  from  the  exercise.  Scenario  A cor- 
responds  to  the  expected  P/L  should  the  Anarchists  win  and  Scenario  B to 
that  if the  Anarchists  lose.  Scenario  A presents  a  high volatility  lower  secu- 
rity price  while  scenario  B presents  lower  volatility  higher  security  price. 

The  first  discovery  traders  can  make  about  the  position  is that  although 
it presents  a  Black-Scholes-Merton  gamma  that  is flat  (mildly  positive  in the 
rally and  negative  in the  selloff),  it is short  shadow  gamma.  A rally causes  a 
loss  of 15  and a selloff  a  loss  of 181.

ered  in Chapter  16.

Vega  and  the  Volatility  Surface 

A loud  Italian  option  trader  was  known  to start  singing  “volare,  volare,”  an  Ital- 
ian  popular  song,  every  time  the  market  experienced  a  panic,  to  the  great  annoy- 
ance  of his  peers.  When  asked  for  the  reason  (by  the  angry  author)  he  explained 
that  volatility  came  from  the  Latin  volare,  which  means  “to fly.” 

For  reasons  of  convenience,  this  chapter  will  cover  all  issues  relating  to 
the  evolution  in  the  volatility  curves  and  forward  volatility  as  well  as  the 
forward-start  and  other  non-time-homogeneous  options. (The  best  way  to 
study  a  forward-start  option  is  by understanding  the  sensitivity  to  for- 
ward  or  local volatility  of any  structure. ) 

VEGA  AND  MODIFIED  VEGA 

M@  The  vega  (also  called  zeta,  kappa  by nontraders)  is the  sensitivity  of an 
option  to  the  changes  in the  implied  volatility  for  a maturity  equal  to  its 
stopping  time.  A  nonvanilla  option  will  be  more  precisely  sensitive  to 
the  forward  volatility  in  the  market  between  its  inception  and  its  stop- 
ping  time.  Any  convex  structure  will  have  a  vega. 
eee 

eer  eis 

This  section  of the  chapter  will  focus  on  the  simple  vega  of  a European  op- 
tion  of known  maturity. 
It is expressed  as: 

Ae  Ss 

Coane 

( o  is the  implied  volatility  for  the  maturity  matching  that  of the  option,  F  is 
the  derivative  security,)The  best  way  to  ascertain  it numerically is  by repric- 
ing the  instrument  at different  levels  of volatilities. 

Usually  the  vega  is expressed  as  a  discrete  measure  (i.e.,  for  a  discrete 
move  in the  volatility).  In addition,  many  multiply  it by the  level  of volatility 
to  make  it correspond  to  a  set  percentage  move  in volatility  level(For  exam- 
ple, if volatility  is  18%  and  the  vega  is  .5,  the  option  (or the  structure)  will 
pick  up  50  cents  when  the  volatility  rises  by one  percentage  point  to  19% 
(and  so  on...).

Measuring  Option  Risks 

Some  people  would  derive  the  vega  for  1.8  moves  in  implied  volatility 
(10%)  so  they  can  compare  their  position  risks  across  instruments  by as- 
suming  that  other  markets  had  a  10%  vega  move  as  well.  Their  vega  will 
then:be'  1.8:  times  5  =..90; 

\  Most  vegas  decrease  with  time  except  that  of  a  lookback  and  reverse 

v  knock-out  whose  vegas  increase  with  time  under  some  conditions. 

~ As  with  the  gamma  and  the  theta,  it is easy  to  see  that  the  vega  follows 
a  bell  shape,  with  the  maximum  reached  when  the  option  is  at  the  money 
(by the  forward)  (see  Figure  9.1). 

Figure  9.2  shows  how the rise  in  volatility  would  lengthen  the  tails.  It 
Sf also  gives  a  hint  on  the  convexity:  The  vega  of  at-the-money  options  stays 
the  same  when  volatility  rises  but  the  vega  of  the  options  away  from  the 
money  rises. 

Risk  Management  Rule: 
The  vega  of at-the  money  options  is stable 
to  volatility.  Options  that  are  away  from  the  money  (in-the-money 
or  out-of-the-money)  are  convex  with  respect  to  volatility  for  the 
owner  and  concave  for  the  seller. 

The  rule  is easy  to  verify:  The  second  derivative  9f an  option  price  with  re- 
spect  to  volatility  equals  0 when  the  strike  price  equals  the  forward  and  be- 
comes  increasingly  positive  when  the  strike  price  is away  from  it. 

Warning: 
The  raw  vega  may  be  relevant  for  an  individual  option  but 
means  little  for  the  risks  of an  option  book.  That  effect  will  be explored 
in great  depth  with  the  study  of the  term  structure  of volatility.

Vega  and  volatility. 

The  reader  should  by now  be  familiar  with  this  book’s  leitmotiv:  what_ 

works  for one  single  option  will  not  work  for a book.  The  conventional 
training  of  people,  which  consists  of  toying  with  the  conventional  deriva- 
tives  of  the  Black-Scholes  formula,  has  a  negative  effect  on  their  operating 
style.  Trading  an  option  bears  little  relevance  to  trading  a  book. 

In mathematical 

terms, the book,  neutral  in its lower  moments  (see Chap- 
tera  hy, can easily lose its stability  in the  higher  moments. An option 
,  we 
will  see,  is not  as  “compact”  as  mathematicians  believe.  It will  generally  be 
neutral  in the  lower  moments  and  exposed  to  various  risks  in the  en mo- 
ments{ A simple  option,  though,  loses  exposure  in higher  moments.

Vega  and  the  Gamma 

Vega  is related  to the  gamma  in  a  strange  way  since  they  seem  to  evolve  in 
different  ways{The  vega  is the  integral  of the  gamma  profits  (i.e.,  expected 
gamma  rebalancing  P/L)  over  the  duration  of  the  option  at  one  volatility 
minus  the  same  integral  at  a  different  volatility.  Intuitively,  the  vega  P/L 
that  results  from  the  volatility  going  higher  for  a  long  option  holder  should 
be  equal  to  the  expected  sum  of the  gamma  profits  over  the  period  should

that  should  correspond 

Peeinpie:  A  straddle  owner  sees  his  3-month  straddle  increase  by 
$100,000  owing  to  the  volatility  in  the  market  moving  from  15%  to 
16%.  This  means,  precisely,  that  if the  new,  higher  volatility  prevailed, 
his  gamma  profits  should  yield  over  the  next  period  the  same  exact 
$100,000—barring  slippage.

Mathematically,  it is:

with S the  asset  price,  ft the  time  left  to  expiration,  and o the  volatility. 

The  Modified  Vega 

Risk  Management  Rule:  One  should  not  compare,  net,  or  add  the 
vegas  of  two  options  of  two  different  maturities  without  any 
weighting  in the  measure. 

This  concept  will  be  explained  later  in  the  chapter. 

The  modified  vega  is  a  simplified  one-factor  model  using  the  variance 
of  the  volatilities  broken  up  by maturities  as  an  indicator  of  hedging 
precision. 

/

~l 

The  modified  vega,  while  a  more  potent  indicator  of  risk  than  the  un- 
weighted  vega,  is not  recommended  as  strongly  the more  advanced  modified 
forward  vega,  which  will  also  be  described.  The  reader  will  be able  to  choose 
between  the  two  methods. 
“  Since  all maturities  do not  react  the  same  way  to  changes  in the  percep- 
tion  of future  volatility,  there  is  a need  to  correct  the  vega  both  for  hedging 
and  risk  management  purposes. 

; 

To  intuitively  understand  why the  vega  exposure  for  a book  needs  to be 
weighted,  consider  a  position  long  one-month  options  for  an  equivalent 
$100,000  vegas  and  short  two-year  options  for  the  same  vega  amount  (which 
means  that  the  book  has  a  smaller  number  of  two-year  options).  Assume 
that  a  shock  hits  the  market.  Would  it be  unreasonable  to  assume  that  the 
volatility  of the  one-month  option  would  increase  more  than  the  back  (un- 
less  information  on  structural  changes  indicates  that  the  volatility  spurt 
would  be  sustained)? 

In  other  words (if the  stock  market  were  to  crash  tomorrow,  one-month 
options  would  be  expected  to  rise  considerably  but  such  volatility  would 
not  be  expected  to  be  sustained  for  an  entire  year,  and  one-year  options 
would  rise  in volatility,  but  less  than  shorter  term  options)yThe  market  is ex- 
pected  to  settle  down  after  a  while  and  a  longer  term  option  would  only be 
affected  in  its  early  phase.  On  the  other  hand,  should  the  market  stay  dor- 
mant  for  a  brief  period,  it would  be  foolish  to  believe  that  the  structure  of 
volatility  changed  so  that  the  market  lost  all  of its vigor. 

Vega  and  the  Volatility  Surface

The  modified  vega’ '  corresponds  to  the  sensitivity  of the  options  portfolio 
to  nonparallel  changes in  the general  level  of volatility.  Shorter  maturities  are 
usually  more  sensitive  to  volatility  barring  temporal  information.  But  opera- 
tors  need  to  be  open-minded:  Should  they  discover  that  for  some  reason  the 
vegas  act  in reverse,  they should  calibrate  their  weightings  accordingly.

(with V, the  vega  for  the  maturity  bucket,  F, the  volatility  weight.The compli- 

Cations  in computing  a  bucket  vega  are  discussed  later  in  the  chapter. 

The  convention  is to  use  a  volatility  factor  pillared  around  the  3-month, 
a  medium-term  horizon  that  is liquid  enough  to  satisfy  a  risk  manager.  All 
options  would  be  compared  with  that  maturity  in  their  sensitivity. 

How  to  Compute  the  Simple  Weightings 

The  most  important  step  in  volatility  risk  management  is  the  awareness  of 
the  existence  of  some  weights.  Most  methods  used  by  operators,  despite 
different  levels  of complexity,  yield  similar  results. 

“Theoretical”  Weighting,  (Volatility  We  lem  ines by  the  square  root  of  the 
respective  nominal  duration of every  maturity) y)are  often  called  “theoreti- 
means  that  long-term  volatility  is  constant  and  that  op- 
cal”  by traders.(If 
that  known  long-term  level  at  the  speed  of the inverse  of 
“tions  revert  backto 
the  square  root  of time  (1 in Such  thinking  is grounded  on  the  awareness 
of a  constant  long-term  volatility  as  reflected  by the  price  of the  longest  op- 
tion  on  the  board.  Operators  are  often  proved  wrong  in  markets  because  the 
volatility  of the  SP100  and  the  SP500  indices  has  been  undergoing  constant 
dampening. 

A  teulation  Method. 

The  operator  selects  a  pillar,  say  the  3-month  options 
(generally  the  most  liquid  maturity)  and  weighs  the  exposures  in  the  other 
months  using  a  factor  of duration  V (90/days  to  expiration): 

Example: 
An  exposure  in  1-month  option  will  have V (90/30)  = =  1723 
times  the  importance  of  a  vega  in  the  3-month  option.  An  exposure  in 
the  1-year  will  have  V (90/365)  =  .50  times  the  vega  in  the  3-month.  It 
means  that  $100,000  in  vega  exposure  in  the  1-month  is  equivalent  to 
$173,000  exposure  in  the  3-month  and  $346,000  in  the  1-year. 

. /Empirical  Weightings.  Volatility  weightings  that  are  derived  from  the  ob- 

served  behavior  of prices  in  the  market  are  called  empirical.

tions  and  weighs  the  exposures  in  the  other  months  using  the  relative 
volatility  of each  period.  Typical  relative  volatility  can  be  obtained  by tak- 
ing the  following  ratio: 

Sum  of the  absolute  changes  in  one  period 
Sum  of the  absolute  changes  in the  other  period 

Measurements  by the  two  methods  tend  to  be  similar,  with  a  hitch:  the 
weightings  can  exhibit  considerable  instability.  There  is  some  nonlinearity 
to  take  into  account{At  times  of shock,  the  front  options  tend  to  overreact 
if there  are  structural 
and  lead:  The  back-month  options  usually  wait  to  see 
changes  or  if the  change  in volatility  was  a  simple  bli Smaller  shocks  can 
cause  the  opposite  effect. 

Table  9.1  lists  some  results  of  a  study  performed  by  the  author’  that 
processed  one-day  changes  in  volatility  (1988-1994,  1400  observations), 
using  over-the-counter  closing  data.  The  study  computed  the  ratio  of  the 
move  in the  period’s  implied  volatility  to  that  of the  3-month. 

vA Using  10-day  nonoverlapping  changes  (1988-1994,  1390  observations), 
the  results  shown  in Table  9.2  were  obtained  (in the  shape  of the  ratio  of the 
\Y 
move  in the  period’s  implied  volatility  to  that  of the  3-month)  (Figure  9.3). 
So the  unbelievable  appeared  to be true:  There  is such  a  strong  mean  re- 
version  that  the  long-term  mean  seems  to  drop after  a  large  move  upward 
and  vice  versa,  as  betrayed  by the  relative  stability  of the  one-year  options. 
Using  currencies  in  the  studies  presented  some  significant  advantages 
over  other  financial  instruments.  There  is  in  the  major  currencies  a  devel- 
oped  liquid  over-the-counter  currency  option  market  where  instruments 
are  quoted  in rolling  periods  of one  month,  two  months,  and  so  on.  In addi- 
tion  currency  options  are  quoted  in  implied  volatility  parameters  for  an  at- 
the-money  European  option,  which  reduces  the  risk  of  a  “bad  print.”  (A 
“bad print”  is  a wrong  settlement  price  for  an  option  that  distorts  the  im- 
plied  volatility  ee Listed  markets  tend  to  have  fixed  expirations 
that  complicate  the  study  because  it is arduous  to  follow  a  constant  date.  So 
on  some  days,  the  “front”-listed  option  would  have  15 days until  expiration, 
whereas  on  others  it would  be 33  days,  a  matter  that  can  hinder  the  study.

Warning: 
While  this  weighting  scheme  is applicable  to  swaptions  and 
bond  options,  operators  should  take  proper  care  in  the  measurement  of 
vegas  for  forward-forward  options  such  as  Euros  (EuroMarks,  Eurodol- 
lars,  Eurolira,  etc.).  The  buckets  correspond  to  different  underlying  in- 
struments  with  their  own  volatility  and  their  own  volatility  regimes. 

A  shortcoming  is  that  the  weightings  may  not  be  stable  enough  for 
the  trader  to  consider  them  “square.”  This  leads  to  a  numerical  expo- 
sure  that  would  take  into  account  the  tracking  fluctuations  between 
maturities. 

Advanced  Method:  The  Covariance  Bucket  Vega 

A more  modern  method  to  assess  the  vega  risks  consists  in studying  the  co- 
variance  matrix  of  the  nonoverlapping  forward  buckets.  Prior  to  starting 
the  analysis,  it is necessary  to  define  the  forward  volatility.

FORWARD  IMPLIED  VOLATILITIES 

A  forward  (also  called  forward-forward)  implied  volatility  between 
two  dates  (t1 and  t2) represents  the  expected  volatility  between  the  two 
periods  inferred  from  option  prices. 

We  will  discuss  further  down  the  generalization  of forward  implied  to  the 
Dupire  “local”  volatility. 

Risk  Management  Rule: 
It  is  imperative  for  traders  involved  in 
path-dependent  or  deferred-start  options  to  examine  their  vega 
risks  in forward  buckets. 

Computing  Forward  Implied  Volatility 

We  start  by decomposing  time  in non-overlapping  slices  that  correspond  to 
traded  dates  in the  market  (Figure  9.4). 

ee” 

We  define  the  earliest  possible  starting  date  as  t,, which,  when  it is  the 
present  moment,  becomes  0{  We  define  o,, ,.  as  the  volatility  between  two 
points t, and 1)So the  volatility between  f, and t,,would  be that convention- 
ally  guard in  the  market  as  the  aletility  for  the period.  Accordingly,  the 
volatility  of a  90-day  option  would  then  be  expressed  as  0, 
would 
then  be  the  variance.

(Sometimes  the  existence  of arbitrage  is revealed  by a significantly  lower 
or  higher  forward  volatility  for  a  given  bucket:)Because  options  are  traded 
in  spot  volatilit 
rms  rather  than  forward  volatility,  it is more  difficult  to 
spot  arbitrages  and  easier  for  markets  to  get out  of line.

YE bucket  vega  is  a  more  potent  risk  management  tool  for  vanilla  op- 
tions.  However,  wifi  patl-dependent  options,  it is the  only possible  way  of analyz- 
ing exposures)  As  will  be  discussed,  vanilla  options  present  a  linear  bucket 
sensitivity  to  variance  whereas  path-dependent  options  present  uneven  ex- 
posures  in  the  time  buckets.  Some  of them,  like  knock-out  options,  could  be 
long  vega  one  bucket  and  short  in  another. 

ee exantge How  to  Translate  Regular  Vegas  into  Forward  Buckets: 

Note: 

This  technique  is only  applicable  to  vanilla  products.

“straight”  bucket.

The  preceding  numbers  resemble  those  that  come  out  of  commer- 
cially  available  risk  management  systems.  Should  the  trader  buy  a  3- 
month  option,  the  entire  position  vega  would  show  in  the  bucket  that 
ends  with  the  3-month,  in  the  case  above  the  0-90. 

The  operator  needs,  however,  to  correct  them  in some  rapid  manner. 
Assume  that  path-independent  options  have  exposures  that  are  linearly 
distributed  through  time  (e.g.,  a 3-month  option  would  have  a  third  of 

158 

Measuring  Option  Risks 

its  exposure  to  vega  in  the  first  0-30  bucket,  one  third  in  the  second 
30-60  bucket,  and  one  third  in  the  60-90  bucket). 

This  can  easily  be  theoretically  proven.  It suffices  to  say  that  the 
gamma  is strongest  at the  end  but  that  the  odds  of being  at the  strongest 
point  are  slim,  while  the  gamma  is more  even,  but  weaker,  at  the  begin- 
ning.  It can  also  be viewed  that  the  expectation  of gamma  profit  and  loss 
does  not  vary  with  the  period,  that  the  difference  in integrals  at two  dif- 
ferent  levels  of volatility  would  correspond  to  the  vega. 

The  operator  must  take  into  account  the  unevenness  of the  buckets. 
Since  he  has  decided  to  present  narrower  slices  at  the  beginning  and 
wider  ones  at  the  end,  a  one-year  option  will  have: 

¢  50%  of its  exposure  in  the  180-360  bucket. 

¢  25%  of its  exposure  in the  90-180  bucket. 

*  8.33%  of its  exposure  in each  of the  0-30,  30-60  and  60-90  buckets. 

Table  9.4  decomposes  the  exposure. 

Multifactor  Vega 

his  advanced  vega  method  includes  the establishment  of a forward volatil- 
ity correlation  matrix.  It could  be  done  on a spot  volatility  exposure  pro- 
vided  the  position  does  not  include  path-dependent  or  deferred-start 
components. 

Without  elaborating  on  the  method  (it is described  at  length  in Chap- 
ter  12),  it is possible  to  establish  the  notion  of expected  risk  based  on  nor- 
mal  behavior  of the  buckets. 

Step 1.  (The operator  builds  a  correlation  matrix  of the percentage  moves  be- 
tween  forward-forward  buckets,  say  by slicing  time  into  0-30,  30-60,  60-90,

Statistical  issues  will  appear,  as  with  any  correlation  matrix  of the  sort. 
The  principal  one  relates  to  how  far  back  the  operator  must  go  to  get  a  ma- 
trix  that  carries  any  significance.  A  lengthy  sampling  period  probably 
would  include  periods  so  far  back  that  the  behavior  of volatility  might  have 
been  entirely  different  from  the  present.  A  shorter  one  incurs  the  risk  of 
missing  statistical  significance.  Another  difficulty  relates  to  the  choice  of 
linear  methods  of  statistical  association  (i.e.,  correlation)  in  markets  that 
may  not  be  tractable  with  the  least-square  models. 

Step  2.  (The final exposure  is  computed  with  the  aid  of  some  simple  ma- 
trix?  algebra,  yielding  one  single  number.  Such  an  analysis  would  disclose, 
in addition  to  the  vega  weightings,  the  stability  of the  exposures)  Neighbor- 
ing  buckets  would  present  a  stronger  compatibility  so  the  exposures  be- 
tween  them  would  cancel  out  more  thoroughly  than  exposures  in  remotely 
spaced  buckets.

down  the  formulas  prior  to  using  an  example  that  fits  the  previous  matrix. 

The  volatilities  of the  forward  buckets  are:

V2  =  Vol(30-60)

V4  =  Vol(90-180) 

V5  =  Vol(180-360) 
V6  =  Vol(360-730) 

The  trader  then  builds  the  exposure  vector,  using  for  input  the  vegas  for 
10  percent  change  in  volatility  (i.e.,  P/L  resulting  from  volatility  moving 
from  15%  to  16.5%) and multiplying  every  one  by 10  times  the  correspond- 
ing  V (daily  volatility).  Owing  to  the  nonlinearity  of the  effect  of volatility 
on  a  book,  the  exposure  can  be  better  approximated  by using  a  local  band, 
here  10%,  rather  than  move  volatility  to  zero  and  obtain  a  “face  value  vega” 
that  would  be grossly  distorted.

Example: 

Take  the  previous  exposure,  as  shown  in Table  9.7. 

The  exposure,  using  the  one-factor  “weighted”  volatility  framework, 
would  show  the  position  to  be  flat.  (See  Table  9.8.)  The  trader  can  analyze 
the  position  using  the  conventional  method  by reconstituting  the  “raw” 
buckets.  Thus  vega(0,90)  can  be  reconstituted  with  the  intermediate 
buckets: 

SA Vega(0,90)  =  Vega(0,30)  +  Vega(30,60)  +  Vega(60,90) 

The  same  position  presents  a  value  at  risk  of $21,000.  So, using  accurate 
historical  data,  such  a  position  is supposed  to  move  by an  average  of $21,000 
per  day in spite  of being  square. 

An  even  more  interesting  approach  is  to  incorporate,  in  addition  to  the 

time  buckets,  possible  skew  shifts.

Volatility  Surface 

SF volatility  surface  (also  called  a  Dupire-Derman-Kani  Surface  by 
traders)  is  the  representation  of  the  values  of  implied  volatility  in  the 
market  represented in  function  of the  time to  expiration  (horizontally) 
and  the  strike  price  (vertically).  It is  used  to  derive: 

e  A spot  curve  displaying  the  volatility  from 0 to  time  f. 
°  A “local”  volatility  curve  showing  the  instantaneous  volatility  at dif- 
ferent  possible  asset  price  levels  at different  points  in  the  future.” 

It is easily  seen  that  the  local  volatility  is to  forward  volatility  what  a  di- 
agonal  spread  is  to  a  calendar  The  local  volatility  is  the  generalization  by 
Dupire,  Derman,  and  Kani  of the  forward  volatility  between  two  Sone 

The  Table  9.9  shows  the  implied  volatility  as  a  function  of the  number  of 
days  to  expiration  and  the  strike  price  of the  listed  SP500  options  as  shown 
on  the Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange.  To prevent  the  chronic  inaccuracies  as- 
sociated  with  the  settlement  price  system,  these  were  provided  by a  market 
maker  who  drew  an  accurate  snapshot  of where  options  were  quoted in  the 
pit at the  most  liquid  times. 

Needless  to  say  that  put/call  parity  is respected  since  puts  and  calls 
typically  trade  at  the  same  volatility.  The  American  feature  is  “weak”  (see 
Chapter  1) and  market 
makers typically  use  the  out-of-the-money  leg of any 
strike  as  a  benchmark.  (If the  put  is  out  of  the  money,  its  volatility  will  be 

__used,  not  that  of the  corresponding  call.)

Figure  9.7  shows  the  volatility  surface.  It is called  the  spot  surface,  not 

the  forward  volatility  surface,  as  described  earlier  in  the  chapter. 

Figure  9.8  corresponds  to  a  function  estimating  the  volatility  as  a  func-

Oh HE  METHOD  OF  SQUARES  FOR  RISK  MANAGEMENT 

/ the same  method  used  to  compute  the  multifactor  vegas  with  the  aid  of a 
volatility  matrix  by isolating  the  exposures  in buckets  and  testing  the  sta- 
bility  of  the  hedges  can  be  applied  by  cutting  the  position  in  squares  of 
strikes  and  time  to  expiration.  The  advantage  of such  a  method  is that  it dis- 
closes  the  sensitivity  of  the  position  to  various  deformations,  such  as  the 
skew  stability  (Figure  9.9). 

oe  The  method  of squares  consists  of cutting  the  position  into  units  com- 
posed  of small  squares  and  estimating  the  vega  per  square.  Such  a  method

is  required  in  “skewed”  markets  such  as  the  equity  indices  or  the  beastly 
Euro-Yen  where  the  risks  of  the  shape  of  the  skew  are  often  superior  to 
those  of volatility. 

The  trader  would  next  run  the  correlation  matrix  between  the  implied 
volatilities  of the  different  squares  to  obtain  a  clear  picture  of the  risks.  This 
method  is  not  necessary  in  well-behaved  markets  but  imperative  in  skew 
products.  In  the  DEM-USD  pair,  for  example,  the  square  s17  is  very  corre- 
lated  with  the  square  s57  or  any  other  in the  t7 bucket.  This  is not  the  case  of 
the  SP  where  skew  shifts  can  cause  some  rotation  of the  volatility  surface. 

The  final  vega  exposure  can  be  obtained  by drawing  a  giant  matrix 
and  repeating  the  exercise  of the  multifactor  vega  described  earlier  in  this 
chapter.

Theta  and  Minor  Greeks 

Almost  one  century  ago,  a  young  French  mathematician  named  Gaston  Bachelier 
had  the  insight  (among  other  surprising  intuitions)  to  write,  in  his  doctoral 
thesis,  see  Bachelier  (1900),  that  the  expected  price  tomorrow  of a  call  value 
was  today’s.  He gave  the  right answer  to what  most  option  beginners  fail to  un- 
derstand:  that  time  decay  is not  the  expected  P/L from  an  option.  If the  option  is 
priced  at  the  right  volatility  (assuming  interest  rates  are  0),  time  decay  will  be 
expected  to be 0. 

THETA  AND  THE  MODIFIED  THETA 

The  theta  is a  loss  in  time  value  of an  option  portfolio  that  results  from 
the  passage  of time. 

Theta  is  called  rent  by traders.  Some  traders  never  go  home  paying  theta: 
Many former  option  traders  incur  time  decay  phobia. 

The  pricing  is  straightforward:  The  trader  can  use  the  difference  be- 
tween  the  price  of  an  option  today  and  the  same  on  the  next  day,  keeping 
everything  else  constant. 

One  way  to  look  at  the  representation  of  theta  is  that  it  goes  hand  in 
hand  with  gamma.  The  alpha  (gamma  per theta ratio)  will be  the  same  re- 
gardless  of the  number of days to expiration,  and  so  on.  Selling  very  short- 
term  options,  a  sport  that  is periodically  practiced  by newcomers,  would  be 
an  attractive  breadwinner  except  that  the  risks  are  exactly  the  same  as  sell- 
ing longer  options,  unless  the  trader  sells  an  expensive  strike. 

Figures  10.1  and  10.2  show  the  time  decay  for  an  at-the-money  and  an 

out-of-the-money  option. 

Modifying  the  Theta 

Theta  corresponds  to  the  repricing  of a  portfolio  with  one  day  less  to  expi- 
ration  and  checking  the  difference  between  the  two  prices.  However,  what  if 
the  volatility  and  other  parameters  for  period  t+1  were  different  than 
those  of period  t?

Changes  in  at-the-money  option  price  with  time. 

_/ example:  Thirty-day  options  trade  at  16%;  29-day  options  trade  at 
15.8%.  Should  the  trader  assume  that  a  position  in  a  30-day  option 
would  “converge”  to  15.8%  volatility  tomorrow  when  the  position  will 
have  29  days  of shelf  life?  Or  should  he  assume  that  the  29-day  implied 
volatility  tomorrow  will  be at  16%? 

: 

There  is  always  the  question  of  whether,  like  interest  rates,  forward 
volatility  is  a  predictor  of  future  volatility  or  whether  a  volatility  curve 
exists  for  structural  reasons.  Should  the  reader  believe  that  the  term  struc- 
ture  of volatility  reflects  future  volatility,  that  there  is  valuable  informa- 
tion  embedded  in  the  curve,  there  is  no  reason  to  modify  the  theta.  In 

many  cases,  however,  it  makes  sense  to  do  so.  Sometimes,  information 
about  a  meeting  causes  the  curve  to  price  at  a  higher  volatility  in  the  days

immediately  following  the  event  and  the  predictive  powers  of the  volatil- 
ity curve  become  incontrovertible.  Most  times,  there  is no  reason  for  such 
a  curve  other  than  the  belief  in  the  mean  reversion  of  volatility.  In  those 
cases,  modification  of  the  theta  should  be  entirely  subjective  and  left  to 
the  discretion  of the  trader. 

Modified  theta  is  the  price  of  an  option  today  using  current  volatility 
less  the  price  of  the  same  option  tomorrow  using  the  volatility  of  one 
day shorter  option. 

It is usually  interpolated  using  a  square  root  of time  method,  to  take  into  ac- 
count  the  possible  drop  on  the  volatility  curve. 

Theta  for  a  Bet 

As  markets  come  close  to  the  barrier,  theta  can  be overwhelming  (see Chap- 
ters  17  and  18). 

Theta,  Interest  Carry,  and  Self-Financing  Strategies 

Traders  eliminate  the  interest  costs  of  holding  the  premium  to  compute  the 
theta  because  the  carry  ofan  option  should  be  neutral  to  a  trader  who  funds 
himself.  In  other  words(if 
the  trader  incurs  carry  costs,  the  price  of the  theta 
will  be  increased  by the  interest  paid  on  the  premium,  making  it totally  neu- 
tral.  Thus,  if interest  rates  are  20%,  theta  will  be lower  by 20%  of the  total  pre- 
mium  (the  option  will  have  a  lower  price  because  of the  present-value  effect) 
but  the  carry  costs  of  holding  the  option  will  offset  these  savings.  It  is  as- 
sumed  that  the  trader  has  borrowed  the  money  to  buy  the  option  and  that  he 
would  pay  the  difference  in higher  interest. 

Many  traders  erroneously  factor  the  premium  costs  in  the  theta 

computation. 

As  a  convention,  in  this  book,  theta  includes  no  premium  costs. 
In  the  derivation  of  an  option  value  through a self-financing  strategy, 
the  seller  of the  option  is  supposed  to  buy  an  interest-yielding  instrument. 
This  is  equivalent  to  the  option  trader  funding  himself  from  his  firm  by 
paying  for  negative  balances  and  earning  interest  on  positive  ones. 

More  controversial  is  the  notion  of the  forward.  When  the  trader  moves 
the  portfolio  up  one  day  for  reevaluation,  should  he  move  up  the  spot  to  the 
forward,  considering  that  the  expected  spot  is  the  forward  price?  Many 
traders  do  not  do  so,  as  it  matters  little.  However,  in  markets  where  the 
cash-future  line  is steep,  this  makes  a  considerable  difference.  It seems  best 
to  deal  with  this  issue  using  the  trader’s  expectation.  If the  trader  feels  that 
the  expectations  built  into  the  forward  are  erroneous,  he  needs  to  analyze 
the  delta  with  such  belief  in mind.

This  issue  will  be  dealt  with  at  length  in Chapter  12. 

Shadow  Theta 

Losses  from  theta  are  generally  worse  than  predicted,  as  premium  buyers 
become  the  victims  of  additional  marks-to-market  losses.  This  is  often  be- 
losses  from  theta,  caused  by quiet  markets,  are  compounded  by losses 
causé 
from  the  drop  in  implied  volatility  that  accompanies  quiet  markets  (as mar- 
kets  stop  moving,  the  expectation  of future  movement  declines).  This is not 
always  applicable  to  structures and  needs  to be measured  using  appropriate 
Care and subjective judgment. (quiet market  ahead  of a  political  announce- 
ment  or  a  refunding  session  can  lead  to  situations  of “reverse  decay.” 
Iso, 
option  prices  are  sometimes  so  undervalued  that  the  forecast  of the  quiet 
period  is built  in) 

‘ _Axample:  Thirty-day  options  trade  at  a  volatility ‘of 16%.  It is conceiv- 
able  that,  7 days from  now,  if nothing  happens,  the  23-day  option  would 
~ 
be  priced  at  14%.  The  shadow  theta  is  the  tegular  theta  plus  the  price 
impact  of the  expected  decline in  volatility. 

Thee  is  anumber  that,  taken  on  its  own,  has  little  meaning.  It theoreti- 
cally@ssum 
that  nothing  else  but  time  moves  (volatility  and  asset  price 
constant).)Uraders,  however,  may  have  information  about  the  behavior  of 
volatilify  if the  spot does  not  move,  and  the  changes  in volatility  should  spot 
moves. 

Theta  becomes  much  lower  when  the  markets  move.  This  is  the  same 
reasoning  asthe  one  used in the shadow gamma analysis. Again,  it relies  on 
an  entirely  subjective  perception  of the  behavior  of implied  volatility  under 
a  certain  set  of conditions. 

If  the  trader  believes  that  volatility  may

drop  should  the  market  remain  frozen  such  information  needs  to 
be  included  in  the  time  decay. 

Figure  10.3  shows  the  phenomenon,  with  the  two  curves,  both  produc- 
ing the  profits  and  losses  at  some  point  in  the  future.  The  first  curve  (“un- 
changed  volatility”)  shows  the  regular  theta.  The  second  curve  (“variable

~ In the past, the author  has  tried  to measure  this  effect  with  some  success. 
It helps  in  determining  the  optimal  gamma  hedges  when  the  market  whip- 
saws  between  levels  and  thus  allows  for  better  capturing  of  the  gamma. 
Tighter rebalancing  ¢ always  helps  mitigate the accelerated  time  decay. 

Weakness  of  the  Theta  Measure 

The  major  weakness  of  theta  is  that  it is  a path-independent measure.  No 
ee true  measure  of time  decay  between  period  t and  period  t +  1 (ie., t , t  plus 1 
day)  can  forecast  the  effect  of  the “whipsaw,”  the  path  where  the  market 
snaps  away  from  its  origin  then  returns  to  it during  the  time  interval.  Such 
an  event  is theoretically  improbable  but  rather  frequent  in  reality.

M  The  rho  is  the  sensitivity  of  an  option  position  to  the  interest  rates  in

relationship. 

rhe most  misunderstood  option  risk  is  the  rho.  Most  of  the  confusion  oc- 
curs  because  it assumes  a  parallel  shift  in the  curve,  and  parallel  shifts  gen- 
erally  take  place  exclusively  in  the  imagination  of rookie  risk  managers. 

The  rho  needs  to  be  broken  up  into  its components{  the rhop,  the  rhol, 

and  the  rho2. 2. |

Option  Wizard:  The  Joys  of Interpolation 

\ 

/Kield curves  are  not  given  in  the  market  as  one  simple  continuous  line.  The  se- 
curities  from  which  the  curve  is derived  correspond  to  fixed  and  known  matu- 
rities.  Maturities  that  fall  in  between,  for  mark-to-market  purposes  in  dealer’s 
inventories  need  to  be  interpolated  in  some  way  or  another. 

The  way  “broken  dates”  are  interpolated  is a  matter  of significance,  partic- 
ularly  for  nonyield-curve  option  instruments  that  depend  on  some  interest  rate 
for  input.(A  currency  option  requires  the  risk-neutral  yield  curves  for  both 
sides  of  the  currency  pair.  An  equity  option  requires,  in  addition  to  the  nu- 
meraire  currency  yield  curve,  the curve for the dividend  payou) (something  so 
difficult  that  equity  option  traders  prefer  not  to  talk  about  it). 

This  book  will  not  discuss  the  techniques  of  interpolation  as  they  have 
been  the  subject  of  Byzantine  hairsplitting  polemics  between  quants  with  free 
time  on  their  hands  and  some  patience  for  details. 

The  first  principle  used  for  interpolation  is eliminate  jaggedness.  Visualize 

an  extreme  case  of a  seesaw  yield  curve  as  in  the  chart  on  the  left: 

Yield

Maturity 

Interpolating  straight-line  on  the  yield  curve  in  this  chart  causes  some 
sharp  local  peaks.  True,  the  yield  curve  might  be  irrational  but  there  are  signif- 
icant  reasons  to  smooth  out  the  peak:  The  market  cannot  be  expected  to  expe- 
rience  such  drops  between  two  dates  (except,  of  course,  if  there  is  some 
information  in  between). 

One  method,  among  many  others,  used  to  smooth  out  the  curve  is called 
cubic  spline.yIt  is used  by road-building  engineers  to  make  sure  that  their  roads 
do  not  experience  very  sharp  turns  anywhere  and  cause  accidents.*(Applying 
such  technique  would  result  in the  curve  on  the  right,  more  pleasant  to  the  eye. 
The  second  curve  appears  smoother  but  may  present  some  unsatisfactory 
peaks  that  the  trader  can  then  correct  again.  There  are  mixtures  of techniques 
that  the  research  assistant  would  gladly  explain  at  length. 

This  leads  us  to  the  second  principle:  Adapt  to  the  market.  If the  market 
happens  to  use  some  irrational  technique  for  interpolation  the  trader  needs  to 
conform  to  it for  pricing,  though  not  for  the  decision-making  process. 

/ The  method  simply  consists  of fitting  cubic  polynomials  between  nodal  points  by making  sure 
that  the  derivative  of each  polynomial  is equal,  at  each  node,  to  that  of the  derivatives  of  both 
the  preceding  and  the  following  polynomial.

ww The  rhop  corresponds  to  the  risks  associated  with  the  financing  of the 

premium  of the  option. 

oe The  rho  corresponds  to  the sensitivity 

of a portfolio  of options  to  the 
base currency  interest  rates  in which  the  P/L  is computed.  For  a  dollar- 
denominated  equity  option,  it is  the  USD  rate.  For  a yen-demoninated 
equity  option,  it is the  yen  rate.  In  a  currency  option  pair,  it is  the  base 
currency  or,  if the  pair  is in  two  different  currencies,  say  DEM-JPY,  the 
rhol  is  calculated  for  the  currency  in  which  the  unrealized  P/L  is ini- 
tially  accounted. 

Rhop  is included  in rhol. 

al 

The  rho2  corresponds  to the  sensitivity  of the  portfolio  to the  risk-neutral 
rate  of  return  of  the  underlying  asset.'  For  an  equity,  it is  the  dividend  ~  , 
payout.  For  a  currency,  it is the  foreign  interest  rate,  or  “counter  rate.” 

\V 

The  yield  curve  moves  in parallel  only by accident.  It could  undergo  moves 
that  change  its  shape  in  addition  to  the  moves  in  the  market  prices.  Typi- 
cally,  yield  curve  models  are  built  to  ascertain  the  speed  of variation  of the 
relative  maturities.  Simple  models  take  into  account  the  slope  of the  curve 
as  a  indicator  of  future  relative  speed  of  movement,  while  more  complex 
ones  take  into  account  the  deformations  of the  curve  (in higher  and  higher 
degrees  of deformation).  Because  this  text  is not  about  primary  yield  curve 
risks  (it is principally  concerned  with  volatility,  not  the  underlying  process) 
but  has  a  focus  on  secondary  yield  curve  risks  (the  risks  are  incidental  to 
the  position),  simpler  methods  of calculating  the  true  rho  can  be used  with- 
out  much  loss  of  precision.  The  section  on  stacking  in  Chapter  12  shows 
more  sophisticated  risk  measurement  techniques. 

The  modified  rho  is the  application  of any  simple  one-factor  yield  curve 
model,  (the  relative  variance  of each  maturity)  to  calculate  the  true  sen- 
sitivity  of an  option  book  to  the  interest  rates  in the  market. 

A brief  examination  of interest  rates  would  show  that  the shorter  rates 
more volatile  than  the longer  ones.  While a  purblind  person  could 
are  often 
see that moves  are  generally  higher  in  the  front  than  in  the  back,  a  more 
thorough  analysis  is  required  to  find  the  factors  determining  the  relative 
exposure  of one  contract  compared  with  another.  Yield  curve  models  gener- 
ally  use  some  assumptions  about  the  “reversion,”  itself  a  function  of  the 
shape  of the  curve. 

The  modification  of  the  Rho  should  take  into  account  the  relative 

volatility  of the  underlying  instruments  and  their  correlations. 

174  Measuring  Option  Risks 

As  with  volatility  weightings,  there  are  several  methods  for  computing 
such  behavior,  ranking  from  the  very  simple  to  those  inspired  by the  richer 
Heath  Jarrow  Morton  (1987)  general  framework  of  models.  Like  the  vega 
modification,  a  simple  method  of  relative  weightings  outperforms  the  un- 
weighted  rho  by a  large  measure. 

Simple  weightings  are  calculated  by measuring  the  average  move  of one 

maturity  compared  with  another.

_ Reminder:  A benchmark  is required.  The  benchmark  is a  liquid  matu- 
rity to which  the  rest  of the  curve  exposures  are  equated.  Traders  gener- 
ally use  the  3-month  as  the  benchmark.  The  rho  and  modified  rho  of the 
benchmark  are  equal.

Omega  (Option  Duration) * 

4 

Ne 

The  option  duration,  also  called  omega,  is  the  expected  life  of  a  soft 
path-dependent  option.  For  a  barrier  option  and  American  binary 
structure,  the  option  duration  is  generally  called  first  exit,  or  stop- 
ping,  time. 

The  option  duration  is conceptually  different  for an  American  option  than 
for  a  barrier,  because  the  barrier  is  an  exit  price  known  in  advance, 
whereas  an  American  option  does  not  provide  for  a  predetermined  exer- 
cise  price  or  time. 

Theta  and  Minor  Greeks

“American  options  have  an  expected  life  that  is equal  to  or  shorter  than 
that  of an  equivalent  European  option  of the  same  maturity.  So  do  barrier 
options  as  these  instruments  can  be  terminated  earlier  than  the  end  date. 

This  aspect  of  American  options  is  particularly  meaningful  when  one 
has  recourse  to a steeply  rising  or  a  steeply  declining  volatility  term  struc- 
ture.  The  exercise  of an  American  option  depends  on  the  two  following  de- 
cision  rules  (see  Chapter  1): 

¢  The  Soft  Rule: 

A comparison  of the  premium  over  intrinsic  value 
(determined  by the  time  value  of the  option)  and  the  earnings  from 
the  reinvested  premium  in  a  money  market  instrument.  If the  op- 
tion  premium  costs  $2  in  financing  until  the  final  expiration  date 
and  the  extra  premium  of the  option  is only  $1, it becomes  optimal 
to  exercise  the  option. 

e¢  The  Hard  Rule: 

A  comparison  of the  premium  over  intrinsic  value 
and  the  costs  of  maintaining  the  underlying  delta  until  expiration. 
The  position  in  the  underlying  asset  can  have  a  “negative  carry”  (i.e., 
the  currency  pair  one  is  short  has  one  currency,  the  short,  yielding  a 
higher  interest  rate  than  the  long leg, or  a  stock  paying  an  extremely 
high  dividend,  much  higher  than  the  financing  rates  in  the  market). 
For  example,  being  long  USD-MXP  (long  dollars  against  short  the 
Mexican  peso)  with  the  annual  interest  rates  in  Mexico  for  the  term 
at 50%  and  those  in the  United  States  at 6%,  will  cost  44%  per  annum 
in  carry.  A deep  in-the-money  call  on  Mexico  would  force  the  opera- 
tor  into  the  following  choice: 

Sell  Mexico  against  the  deep  in-the-money  call  and  incur  the  costs 
of borrowing  the  currency  at  50%  and  lending  dollars  at  6%. 

Abandon  the  option  as  the  game  isn’t  worth  the  costs.  It is more  ad- 
vantageous  to  forgo  the  returns  from  the  possible  future  volatility. 

As  shown  earlier, the  rules  of premature  exercise  depend  on  two  para- 
meters  that can vary: volatility  and  carry.  While testing  the  premium  ver- 

and  the  optimal  decision  reversed  should  one  of the  two  undergo  changes. 
This  makes  a  more  complex  method  of  decision  making  necessary  when 
either  interest  rates  are  volatile  or  the  yield  curve  presents  a  steep  slope.  A 
nested  binomial  (or  trinomial)  tree  is  one  such  best  technique,  although 
some  operators  resort  to  the  heavier  Monte  Carlo  methods. 

The  strength  of a  binomial  tree  is that  it can  include  within  itself  some  in- 
formation  on  future  volatility  and  interest  rates,  through  both  the  forward 
price  and  its  process.  The  volatility  does  not  need  to  be  constant  between

here are  two  levels  of  methods  involving  “local”  volatility:  the  basic  and  the 

stochastic  parameter  binomial/trinomial. 

pneu 

The  basic binomial  tree  prices  options  using  information  available  from 
the  market  and  applies  it to  the  growth  between  nodes.  Such  information 
could  be  the  forward  volatility,  the  interest  rates  forwards,  the  skew,  and  so  on. 
The  following  chart  shows  that  the  parameters  used  correspond  to  both 
forward  volatility  and  forward  interest  rates  rather  than  spot  rates.  Each  state 
between  S(O)  and  S(3)  depends  on  a  forward  volatility  for  the  magnitude  of the 
u  or  d moves  (the  size  of the  steps)  and  the  carry  rd-d  (interest  rate  differential 
or  dividend  net  of financial  carry).  Forward  volatility  affects  the  absolute  size  of 
both  u  and  d while  the  carry  determines  the  ratio  u/d.

For  reasons  beyond  the  scope  of  this  book,  a  trinomial  tree  is  more  adapt- 
able  to  the  processes  of forward-forward  parameters.  The  trinomial  presents  the 
advantages  of allowing  for  changes  in  volatility  through  the  middle  node  (bino- 
mial  trees  often  do  not  recombine  when  operators  try to  include  a  “smile”). 

The  stochastic  parameter  tree  is an  adaptation  of the  preceding  tree  with 

another  branching  for  volatility  and/or  interest  rates  at  every  node. 

The  following  figure  shows  a  simplified  state  of  the  volatility  curve  at

but  can  easily  be  applied  to  the  volatility  curve. 

*The  reader  unfamiliar  with  binomial  trees  would  gain  from  reading  an  introductory  text  on  bi- 
nomial  option  pricing,  such  as  Cox  and  Rubinstein  (1985)  or  Hull  (1993). 

‘Most  traders  who  discussed  the  point  with  the  author  throughout  the  years  showed  a  marked 
preference  for  simulating  and  modeling  a  “skewed”  process:  higher  probability  of  declining 
olatility  and  lower  probability  of  rising  volatility, both  states  having  equal  expected  payoffs 
(higher  up-moves). 

nodes.  The  operator  can  thus  defer  the  early exercise  if the  tree  disclosed  that 
he would  have  to  regret  it should  the  following  day bring  a  higher  volatility. 
Another  way  to  view  it  is  that  the  American  option  needs  all  kind 
of  possible  information  between  time  zero  and  the  expiration.  A  closed 
form  formula  would  not  carry  such  information:  The  Black-Scholes- 
Merton  method  only  requires  operators  to  plug  into  their  computer  the 
market  parameters  on  the  expiration  date  without  more  information  in 
between.

A shortcut  method  used  by the  author  is the  “Rho fudge.” Its purpose  is 
to  find  the  right  duration  (i.e.,  expected  time  to  termination)  for  an  Ameri- 
can  option.  Knowing  the  right  maturity  allows  for: 

e  The  use  of  the  right  parameter  for  the  pricing  of  the  option  (i.e., 

volatility  and  term  interest  and  carry  rates). 

e  A better  test  for  early  exercise. 

It involves  deriving  the  sensitivity  to  interest  rates  of  the  path-depen- 
dent  option  by assuming  that  the  expected  life  of  the  option  would  match 
that  of the  synthetic  interest  rate  instrument  thus  derived.

Rho2  of an  American  option 
Rho2  of a  European  option 

The  reason  Rho2  (it corresponds  to  the  foreign  rate  or  the  dividend  pay- 
out)  is used  instead  of Rhol  is because  it excludes  the  financing  cost  of the 
premium.  The  trader  also  can  compute  the  Rho2  from  the  delta  by assuming 
that  the  delta  is  a zero-coupon  bond  of the  nominal  maturity  provided. 

Example:  Assume  that  the  1-year  American  option  is  equivalent  to  a 
European  one  (zero  probability  of  early  exercise):  The  omega  should 
then  be  one  year. 

Rho2  of a  1-year  option  =  delta  X 1 (i.e.,  a  rise  in  100  basis  points  in 
the  foreign  rate  or  the  dividend  payout  would  correspond  to  a  100  basis 
points  rise  in the  option  price).

This  method,  while  far  from  thorough,  provides  a  rapid  tool  to  com-

Alpha 

Gas The  alpha  (also  called  gamma  rent)  is the  theta  per  gamma  ratio  for  an 

option  position. 

St reflects  the  gamma  quality  in  terms  of the  “rent”  and  thus  is the  best  in- 
dicator  of the  quality  of  the  earnings  from  gamma  for  one  dollar  risked 
overnight.  A  high  alpha  means  that  the  premium  owner  is  not  adequately 

Theta  and  Minor  Greeks 

179 

compensated  for  the  costs  of  the  time  decay.  A  low  alpha  means  that  the 
trader  is risking  little  theta  for  the  gamma. 

The  premium  seller  who  does  not  collect  enough  premium  for  the  risks 
taken  will  not  survive  for  long.  Typically,  spreading  options  (see  Chapter 
16)  helps  achieve  a  better  alpha  (that  is  a  lower  one  for  the  longs  and  a 
higher  one  for  the  shorts),  through  the  purchase  of a  cheap  option  and  the 
sale  of an  expensive  one. 

It is computed  as  follows: 

“Alpha =  Decay/Gamma 

A  more  advanced  computation  of  the  alpha  would  use  the  modified 

theta,  instead  of the  analytical  theta,  as  a  rate  of decay. 

The modified 

theta takes  into account  the slide  on the curve.  It can  be 

computed  as: 

aiona  =  Modified  decay/Gamma 

Gamma  is  also  more  accurate  when  discretely  computed.  It  is  always 
preferable  to  calculate  the  shadow gamma  when  deriving  the alpha, to  get the 
full  picture  of both the risks and the returns. 

The fair value alpha according  to to a schedule  of volatility  levels is  pre- 
sented  in  Table  10.1. Assuming  interest  rates  are  zero  (or  that  the  pre- 
mium  account  would be  eventually  charged  back  to  the  trader in  his  cash 
account)? 

Theta  =  4 Gamma  X (Volatility)*  (Asset  price)? 

Hence 

Alpha  =  Cierra 

ens  eae 
ging S 

which  is  insensitive  to  time  to  expiration  (at  constant  volatility,  or  flat 
volatility  term  structure).  Most  beginning  option  traders  (and  some  un- 
skilled  veterans)  think  that  by selling  short-term  options  they  may  be  cap- 
turing  more  time  decay  for  the  risks  involved.  The  gamma of a  longer 
option 

is lower  than  that  of the  front but  so  is time - decay. 

he  alpha  could  be  dependent  on  time  to  expiration  if  the  volatility 
“evel  depended  on  the  number  of days to  go.  If the  volatility  of the  3-month 
traded  lower  than  the  6-month,  then  the  alpha  of  the  6-month  would  be 
different  from  the  alpha  of the  3-month.  Otherwise,  it would  be  the  same. 
Eliminating  the  interest  carry  from  the  equation,  as  explained  earlier  in 
this  chapter,  allows  the  trader  to  get  a  pure  theta  number  untainted  with 
interest  rates.

Risk  Management  Rule:  An  alpha  that  is lower  than  the  fair  value 
alpha  for  a  short  gamma  position  or  higher  than  a  fair  value  alpha 
for  a  long  gamma  position  will  result  in  long-term  losses  (by  the 
law  of large  numbers).? 

A 

. Arable  10.1  shows  that  at  10%  volatility,  a gamma  should  cost  $1,405  re- 
gardless  of the  expiration. 

xample: 

The  alpha  for  a portfolio  could  yield  unexpected  results.  Ina 
calendar  spread  where  the  1-month  trades  at  11%  annualized  volatility 
and  the  3-month  trades  at  12%,  the  trader  buys  $100  million  1-month 

Theta  and  Minor  Greeks 

181 

at-the-money  calls  at  11  vols:  total  13.5  positive  gammas,  at  a  cost  of 
$22,950  per  day. 

He  sells  $100  million  3-month  at-the-money  calls:  total  7.5  negative 

gammas  for  a  total  cost  of $15,172  per  day. 

The  net  position  will  be  long 6 gammas  at a  cost  of $7,780  per  day. 
The  alpha  is therefore  $1,297  per  gamma.  According  to  the  scale  in 
Table  10.1,  the  trader’s  costs  are  such  that  he  will  break  even  at  close  to 
9.5  volatility,  which  represents  an  average  of .6%  moves  per  day.

The  calculations  shown  in  Tables  10.2  and  10.3  are  usually  memorized  by 
market  makers.  They  can  thus  rapidly  compare  options  without  using  cal- 
culators. 

For  simplification,  no  interest  rates  are  assumed.  The  reader  should  pre- 

sent  value  the  vega  using  e ", t being  the  period  in fraction  of years.

Vega:  Classical  unmodified  at-the-money  vega.  The  reader  can  multiply 
the  period  length  by his  own  factor  to  get the  modified  vega.

option  (by  the  forward).  The  vega  of  a  3-month  at-the-money  option  is 
known  from  the  vega  column  in  Table  10.2.  The  reader  can  thus  derive 
the  vega  of an  out-of-the-money  option  provided  he  knows  the  delta. 

For  a  deep  in-the-money  option,  the  vega  ratio  is 100  minus  the  delta  of

to be  the  same  for  puts  and  calls  of the  same  strike. 

Because  interest  rates  of  zero  are  assumed,  it  becomes  necessary  to  be 
careful  with  the  relationship(when  interest rates rise: The  difference  between

Stealth  corresponds  to the  percentage  difference  between  the  strike  and 
the  trigger.  Health  is  the  percentage  difference  between  the  current 
spot  (not  the  forward,  as  will  be explained)  and  the  trigger. 

Stealth  is  used  as  an  indicator  of  how  much  the  option  resembles  a 
vanilla.  The  higher  the  stealth,  the  closer  the  option  to  a  regular  option  in 
both  price  and  risk  profile: 

e  The  market  trades  at  100.  The  100  call  with  a  knock-out  at  .00001  will 
in all  respects  be  similar  to  a  100  call  plain  vanilla.  The  100  call  with 
a  knock-out  at  300  (the  nasty  reverse  knock-out)  also  will  be  priced 
like  a  regular  call:  Its  difference  will  not  appear  until  close  to  300. 
¢  The  100  call  knock-in  at  .01  will  be  priced  like  no  option.  Likewise,  a 

100  call  knock-in  at  300  will  not  behave  like  much. 

Health  is  an  indicator  of  the  execution  risk.  Because  options  traders 
need  to  unwind  their  hedges  at  the  barrier  (and  need  to  come  as  close  to 
that  point  as  possible),  it  is  a  necessary  risk  management  tool  that  makes 
them  aware  of  the  proximity  of  the  execution.  Typically,  a  warning  flag 
comes  up  when  that  number  drops  below  1 standard  deviation.  Some  people 
mistake  the  health  for  the  difference  between  the  trigger  and  the  forward: 
The  options  do  not  knock  out  at  the  forward.  This  would  only be  applicable 
to  the  rare  forward  knock-out/ins. 

A much  more  potent  measure  than  both  is to  use  the  expected  stopping 
time  (also  called  expected  time  of arrival  or  first  exit  time,  as  described  in 
Chapter  18). 

Convexity,  Modified  Convexity* 

Convexity,  also  called  curvature,  is examined  here  in  a  conventional  frame- 
work  in an  effort  to  incorporate  the  idea  of a  general  yield  curve  behavior  in 
the  measurement.  Traders  will  learn  here  that: 

Convexity  needs  to  be  associated  with  the  volatility  of the  parameter 
concerned. 

e  Convexity  exists  everywhere,  alas  for  the  dynamic  hedger. 

@  Convexity  for  an  instrument  describes  the  nonlinearity  of the  payoff  of 
the  instrument  with  respect  to  a  parallel  move  in one  parameter.  The  in- 
strument  is then  called  convex  with  respect  to  that  parameter. 

Although  convexity  originally  referred  to  bonds,  it  was  discovered 
that  the  concept  needed  to  be  applied  to  all  financial  instruments  and  to 
their  sensitivity  with  respect  to  more  than  one  parameter.  The  convexity

of a  30-year  maturity  and  no  coupon.

Option  Wizard:  Middlebrow  Convexity  versus  Modified  Convexity 

Middlebrow  convexity  is  a measure  of the  sensitivity  of a  structure  to  a  parame- 
ter.  The  technique  is erroneous  for  comparative  purposes  as(the convexity  of  a 
2-year  bond  (with  respect  to  yield)  could  hardly  be  compared  with  that  of 
a  10-year  bond  since  the  two  rates  exhibit  different  volatilities. 

Modified  convexity  is an  attempt  to  rectify  that  by rescaling  to  the  relative 

volatilities.)

money.  Chapter  15 provides  a  discussion  for the  impact  of vega  convexity  on 
‘option  pricing. 

Note.  When  volatility  rises  excessively,  all  options  become  concave  with 
respect  to  volatility  because  every  option  is  capped  at  the  price  of  the  un- 
derlying  asset.  If the  underlying  asset  is worth  100,  an  option  price  cannot 
exceed  100  or  rational  traders  (there  are  a  few)  would  resort  to  buying  the  | 
. 
asset  instead  of the  call. 

Viewed  differently,  at  a  very  high  volatility,  an  asset  becomes  a call  on 
itself  since  it can  rise  infinitely  but  only  go  down  in  a  limited  way.  There- 
fore,  there  will  be  a  convergence  between  the  price  of the  asset  and  that  of 
the  call  option.

Measuring  Option  Risks 

While  most  instruments  that  offer  con- 
Modified  Interest  Rate  Convexity. 
vexity  will  command  a  premium  for  the  extra  kicker,  traders  should  care- 
fully measure  the  behavior  of the  underlying  parameters.\Many  bond  traders 
find  that  instruments  with  the  highest  convexity,  the  long-term  low-coupon  | 
bonds,  become  positioned  on  the  yield  curve  at  the  least  volatile  point,  thus 
making  the  benefits  of their  convexity  smaller  than  expected)  It becomes  er- 
roneous  to  compare  the  convexity  of  a  5-year  with  that  of a  30-year  bond 
without  the  use  of factors  similar  to  the  volatility  weightings. 

The  same  applies  to options.  Often  the  highest  convexity  is found  in back 

month  out-of-the-money  options  with  the  most  stable  implied  volatility. 

Information  about  convexity  multiplied  in the  middlebrow  literature  of 
the  1980s  and  early  1990s.  Assuming  parallel  moves  the  number  is generally 
useless.  Using  a  trader’s  intuition  is  more  helpful  than  computing  indica- 
tors  that  are  misleading  to  the  public.  What  is  remarkable  is  that  these 
methods  ignored  the  academic  developments  pioneered  by Vasicek  (1977), 
Cox-Ingersoll-Ross  (1985a)  and  others  who  developed  methods  of gauging 
the  changes  in the  shapes  of the  yield  curve. 

Much  of the  convexity-based  hedging  implemented  by the  middlebrow 

fund  managers  was  therefore  based  on  faulty  assumptions. 

The  easiest way to modify  convexity is to take ifto account  relative

Sensitivity  is  the  relative  sensitivity  of  the  yield  curve  (expressed  in 
yield)  to  that  of a  10-year  Treasury  bond.  A one-factor  model,  in essence,  se- 
lects  one  instrument  as  a  “pillar”  and  assumes  a  100  percent  correlation 
with  others. 

Using  a  polynomial  interpolation,  it is  possible  to  construct  the  quick- 

and-dirty  approximated  function?  (Table  10.6). 

The  convexity  used  in  this  example  is defined  as  a  dollar  difference  be- 
tween  the  absolute  change  from  a  100  basis  points  move  up  and  a  100  basis 
points  move  down,  for  an  instrument  trading  at  par  with  interest  rates  at 
6%,  which  is close  to  the  general  yield  curve  in June  1995.  This  quick-and- 
dirty  method  could  be  refined  further  by measuring  exact  duration. 

Example.  Eurodollars  Are  Convex: 
This  example  illustrates  the  differ- 
ence  between  forwards  and  futures  where  there  is a correlation  between 
the  price  of  the  instrument  and  its  rate  of  financing.  Its  simplicity 

Theta  and  Minor  Greeks

allows  for  easier  understanding  of  the  notion.  It  illustrates  the  risk 
management  rule  on  convexity  and  concavity  of  futures  that  was  dis- 
cussed  in Chapter  1. 

The  “boost”  (not  to  be  confused  with  the  name  of  a  double-barrier 
linked  product)  is an  implicit  convexity  to being  short  Eurodollar  futures 
because  one  can  reinvest  profits  at a  higher  rate  and  can  finance  losses  at 
a  lower  rate. 

Oe Eurodollar  futures  are  of the  marked-to-market  category;  operators 
receive  the  variation  margin  at  the  closing  of a  profitable  day and  need 
to  pay  it  after  a  losing  one.  There  is  a  connection  between  financing 
costs  and  profitability:  When  the  market  goes  down,  the  short  Eurodol- 
lar  futures  position  earns  money.  The  money  is  wired  to  the  investor 
and  can  thus  be invested  at high rate  (since  the  Eurodollars  went  down). 
Conversely,  the  trader  incurs  losses  when  the  market  goes  up,  but  these 
losses  can  be  financed  at  a  lower  rate. 

Assume  that  the  position  shown  in Table  10.7  is short  400  Eurodollar 
contracts  on  the  Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange  for a  contract  that  expires 
in  one  year.  In  addition,  assume  for  pedagogical  reasons  that  the  yield

curve  is  flat  and  moves  in  parallel  (a 100%  correlation  between  the  fi- 
nancing  of the  position  and  its  profitability). 

When  the  Eurodollars  go  to  9300,  the  trader  is  able  to  reinvest  his 
positive  variation  margin  at 7%,  thus  earning  $70,000  over  the  year  until 
expiration.  When  Eurodollars  go  to  9500,  however,  the  trader  incurring 
a  loss  will  only  finance  it for  $50,000.  This  difference  of $20,000  repre- 
sents  a  minute  convexity  differential,  but  needs  to be taken  into  account 
by traders. 

__4  A  boost  becomes  significant  when  dealing  with  back  months,  since 
if profits  in 5-year  Eurodollars  will  be  reinvested  over  the  next  5 years.  So 

the  boost  increases  when  maturities  lengthen. 

_/  The  boost  accelerates  when  rates  are  high,  as  the  reinvestment  rate 

is higher.' 

The  “Double  Bubble” 

An  interesting  aspect  of the  boost  is that  being  short  a  Eurodollar  strip  pre- 
sents  a  positive  convexity.  This  would  not  be  remarkable  except  that  being 
short  Eurodollar  strips  presents  a  remarkable  hedge  to  being  long  zero 
coupons.  Since  zero  coupons  are  convex  as  well,  the  trade  would  offer  dou- 
ble  convexity,  or  what  one  famous  arbitrageur  dubs  “the  double  bubble.”

Using  a  dynamic  framework,  this  chapter  presents  an  analysis  of  the 
changes  of the  Greeks  in  time  and  space  (the  relation  between  the  asset  and 
the  strike).  Only  these  two  dimensions  are  necessary  because  time  and 
volatility  exert  the  same  effect  on  the  first  and  second  derivatives,  though. 
Eee eae  oan  nly and time  are one and  the  same

exactly  a  proportion  of time.  Where  the  time  exerts  its own  independent  et-

Option  Wizard:  The  Difficult  Boss  (Another  War  Story) 

One  option  trader  recounts  that  he  was  given a limit  by the  management  in  the 
form  of  a  certain  amount  of  maximum  allowable  delta,  vega,  and  theta  expo- 
sures  for  his  position.  So  he  knew  he  needed  to  leave  a  wide  margin  between 
his  exposures  and  the  position  limit. 

One  day,  he  was  long  out-of-the-money  options  and  the  market  exploded 
higher,  taking  him  late  in  the  day  into  an  area  where  his  long  vega  increased 
owing  to  the  position  of his  out-of-the-money  options.  He  was  then  called  into 
his  boss’s  office  to  be  informed  that  the  fine-tuning  clerk  whose  job consisted 
in  measuring  the  trader’s  compliance  with  the  sacrosanct  limits  had  detected  a 
trespassing  of some  gravity.  So  the  following  dialogue  took  place: 

Boss: 

You  are  outside  the  limit. 

Trader:

at  a  higher  volatility.  You  have  to  look  at  both  third  derivatives  with  re-

(silence...) 

Ummph.  This  time,  | will  sign  off  on  the  sheet.  Next  time,  don’t 

Boss: 
cheat  again. 

Every  option  trader  has  such  war  stories.  The  most  ludicrous  ones  involve  a 
limit  in  the  shape  of a  delta  restriction. 

Time  pushes  all  the  out-of-the-money  options  further  out-of-the-money, 
therefore  reducing  their  deltas.  Time  also  pushes  all  the  in-the-money  op- 
tions  further  in-the-money,  therefore  increasing  their  deltas.|  Although 
this 
seems  trivial,  traders  should  not  overlook  the  following  con  leas 
amma 
is  said  to  increase  with  time,  but  for  an  out-of-the-money  option  being 
pushed  further,  out-of-the-money  would  cause  some  gamma  loss.  The  re- 
sults  are  therefore  mixed. } 

Book  runners  are  always  miffed  at  the  alterations  brought  about  by 
time.  Because  portfolios  of  book  runners  always  include  a  mixture  of 

strikes,  with  strong  concentration  away  from  the  money,  a meaningful  daily 
bleed  is guaranteed. 

The  Greeks  and  Their  Behavior 

193 

Risk  Management  Rule:  An  option  position  that  is long  up-gamma 
(see  definition,  Chapter  8) and  short  down-gamma  will  bleed  into 
shorter  delta  over  time,  and  vice  versa. 

\~  The  rule  is  simple  to  understand:  (1) Such  a  position  is  long  out-of-the- 
money  calls  short  out-of-the-money  puts.  The  calls  will  decrease  in  deltas 
(shorter  delta)  since  the  delta  of  out-of-the-money  options  decreases  with 
time  and  the  puts  will  decrease  in deltas  for  the  same  reason  (longer  deltas); 
(2) the  same  position  can  be constructed  (put/call  parity)  with  deep-in-the- 
money  calls  and  puts.  The  same  result  can  be  proven  by the  put-call  parity 
rules  (see  the  discussion  on  option  equivalence  in Chapter  1). 

oe Example: 

For  simplification,  assume  that  the  book  has  two  trades: 

Short  $1,000,000  in  face  value  of a  100  call  expiring  in  60  days  (OPTI  in 
Table  11.1). 
Long  $5,040,000  in  face  value  of a  106  call  expiring  in  30  days  (OPT2  in 
Table  11.1). 

Option  Wizard:  Thank  God  It’s  Friday 

The  bleed  is  always  accentuated  for  traders  ahead  of  a  weekend  when,  after 
Friday  lunch,  they  start  examining  their  Monday  exposures,  not  always  without 
a  shock.  The  endless  dialogues  between  traders  as  to  when  to  set  the  clock 
usually  take  place  then:  whether  to  use  Monday  “sheets,”  Friday  sheets,  or 
somewhere in  between  (sheets  are  printed  reports showing  the  price  of the  op- 
tion at different levels-of asset pr price and. "volatilityy..) 

Traders  commonly  use  risk  management  systems  with  discrete  time.  Options 
4re  not  usually  priced  on  a  continuous  clock.  Time  to  expiration  is  not  updated 
every  second,  but  in  24  hour  increments.  Most  operate  on  a  7-day-week  basis, 
365  days  a  year.  While  this  jump  function  is  of  small  consequence  during  the 
week,  it  becomes  an  endless  source  of  confusion  when,  on  Friday,  the  traders 
issue  portfolio  simulations  with  a Monday  date. 

When  pit traders  perform  “covered”  trades  on  a  Friday  afternoon,  where 
they  trade  the  option  covered  with  the  delta,  disagreements  occur  as  to  the 
amount  of  deltas  to  swap.  It  is then  easy  to  see  that  one  part  of  the  pit  uses 
Friday  deltas,  another  one  Saturday,  another  one  Sunday,  and  so  on.

Implied  volatility  as  usual  is at  15.7%  annualized  (for both  options)  and 
the  market  is initially  at  100. 
The  trade  starts  delta  neutral  as  both  legs match  each  other. 

Table  11.1  shows  that  the  deltas  (delta  1 column)  of the  at-the-money  100 
calls  (OPT1)  remains  constant  (almost,  except  for  a  total  loss  rounded  to  2 
deltas)  while  the  106  calls  (OPT2)  lose  their  deltas  (delta  2 column)  rapidly 
(from  to  512  to  175).  They  “bleed”  fast. 

The  table  shows  the  acceleration  of  gammas  for  the  100  calls  offset 
(“positive  gamma  bleed”)  by a  deceleration  for  the  106  calls,  with  an  impor-

an engineering  education, 
believe  that  fourth  derivatives  are  of small  impor- 
tance  in  practical  life.  They  are  trained  to  cut  everything  beyond  the  second 
derivative,  which,  for  options,  would  be a  gamma.  This  attitude  is incompati- 
ble  with  the  trading  of a  portfolio  of options  where  the  risks  change  abruptly 
between  levels.  Many  option  traders  report  disagreethents  with  Taylor- 
expansion-minded  semimathematicians  who  deride  their  attempt  at  looking 
at  the  heart  of the  position  with  fourth  (and  higher)  derivatives.

Bleed  with  Changes  in  Volatility 

Changes  in  implied  volatility  do  not  overly  complicate  the  bleed.  Volatility 
shifts  can  operate  like  a  time  acceleration,  with  an  effect  that  is  linked  to 
the  length  of  the  option  (more  exactly  the square  of the volatility  shift  is 
proportional to the length of the  option).  Every option  beginner  knows  that 
the shorter  the  option,  the  greater  the  effect  of  time  on  the  structure.  A 
longer dated  option,  say a  one-year  call  with  20  deltas,  would  lose,  at  16% 

196 

Measuring  Option  Risks 

volatility,  .04  deltas  (the  delta  would  go  from  20%  to  19.96%).  A  change  in 
volatility  from  16%  to  15%  would  move  the  delta  from  20%  to  18.2%. 

Warning:  (The barrier  options  trader  needs  to  be  aware  of the  two-way 
Option  Wizard,  Forward  and  Backward  Bleed).  A rise  in  volatil- 
bleed  (see 
ity can  initially  lengthen  the  delta,  while  a  further  rise  could  decrease 
it.  Barrier  options  are  thus  considered  extremely  topical:  What  works 
on  one  point  of  the  possible  map  does  not  necessarily  work  on  ghee? 
The  third,  fourth,  fifth,  and  sixth  moments  (see  definition  later  in  this 
chapter)  are  always  there  to  confuse  operators. 

Going  into  the  Expiration  of a  Vanilla  Option 

Bleed  moving  into  an  expiration. is  so  rapid  that  handling  it properly  re- 
‘quires a  great  deal  of experience.  That is  where  the  difference  between  the 
experience  of listed  traders  with  discrete  expirations  and  that  of over-the- 
counter  operators  with  almost  continuous  ones  becomes  most  apparent. 
Bleed  then becomes  so  fast  that  volatility  changes  cannot  carry  too  large  an 
effect  on  it. 

Many  operators  start  trading  an  expiration  as  a  binary  one,  with  all  the 
bleed  taken  on  the  report  generated  the  previous  day.  At  5 o’clock  the  previ- 
ous  day, they generate  a  run  with  the  deltas  of the  option  in binary  form:  zero 
if the  option  is out  of  the  money  and  100%  if it is  in  the  money.  However,  it 
does  not  mean  that  they will  adjust  their  position  in  a  binary  way.  Most  still 
trade  it in  a smooth  manner,  with  progressive  adjustments.  Others  use  more 
sophisticated  devices  and  trade  “on  the  clock,”  with  their  risk  management 
system  adjusting  the  delta  by repricing  the  portfolio  continuously. 

( Example.  An  Expiration  Day Report:  Assume  that  the  market  trades  at 
0 and  that  the  operator  is short  the  101  calls  expiring  in the  over-the- 

counter  market  at  10:00  a.m.  the  same  day. 

Figures 

11.2 and 11.3 show  the  option  delta  and  price  the  day before  expi- 

ration.  Figures 11.4 and 11.5 show  the  same  elements  on  the  following  day. 

So the  operator  needs  to  flip between  Report  I (Figures  11.2  and  11.3)  and 
Report  II  (Figures  11.4  and  11.5)  by making  sure  that  the  convergence  takes 
place  in  a  smooth  manner.  Ideally,  the  following  would  occur:  The  operator 
would  subscribe  to  the  smoothness  rule  by ascertaining  that  the  transition 
between  two  points  does  not  take  place abruptly.  So Report  I would  hold  at all 
times  but  with  a  continuous  rescaling  in accordance  to  the  passage  of time. 

One  day before  expiration,  the  trader  would  look  at  Report  I. Then  he 
would  need  to  try to  maintain  the  same  smooth  profile  between  two  points 
by narrowing  down  the  scale,  as  by a  microscope  in which  the  magnifying 
power  is gradually  increased.  _

If the  trader  has  no  transaction  costs,  expirations  would  be  completely 
smooth,  as  by the  Black-Scholes-Merton  formula.  However,  traders  need  to 
restrict  their  trading  to  a number  of discrete  interventions.  It does  not  mean 
that  they  need  to  adjust  their  delta  on  expiration  in  a  bin ar 
form.  They

Measuring  Option  Risks 

Option  Wizard  (Advanced):  A Modicum  of Ito  Calculus  - 

When  the  author  was  being  interviewed  for  his  first  job,  a  senior  foreign  ex- 
change  trader  showed  him  the  following  scheme  on  a  tomato-sauce-stained 
restaurant  napkin: 

One  should  sell  a  call  option  on  USD-DEM  for  the  hefty  premium  it then 
commanded.  Then  he  would  leave  a  stop-loss  to  buy  the  full  amount  at  the 
strike  price.  If the  spot  recrossed,  then  he  would  do  the  reverse.  Given  this 
brilliant  strategy,  the  premium  in  the  market  appeared  unjustified. 

The  author  tried  to  register  some  doubt  about  this  plan  but  could  not 
quite  explain  stochastic  integration  to  a  head  option  trader  (besides  this  was 
1983  and  option  traders  concealed  any  degree  other  than  an  MBA  to  avoid 
the  “nerd-discrimination”  that  prevailed  at  the  time). 

Most  option  traders  report  that  they  have  had  to  explain  to  a  boss  why 

they  do  not  follow  such  a  strategy.  The  reason  is as  follows: 

Local  time*  never  becomes  zero,  owing  to  the  non-differentiability  of the 
Brownian  motion.  We  know  from  the  spreadsheet  exercise  that  the  Brown- 
ian  motion  never  becomes  smooth.  Making  the  time  intervals  smaller  does 
not  make  it  more  differentiable;  otherwise,  there  we@uld  be  a  rebalancing 
strategy  that  would  outperform  others.  If traders  rebalanced  at  the  interval 
where  the  function  became  smooth,  they  would  keep  the  entire  premium 
and  there  would  be  no  need  for  this  book. 

( The frequency  of  rebalancing  does  not  affect  the  fair  value  of the  option. 
Assume  that  traders  operate  in  the  Black-Scholes-Merton  world  of  no  transac- 
tion  costs.  The  rebalancing  P/L  does  not  depend  on  the  rebalancing  frequency. 
It does  not  matter  whether  they  rebalance  over  the  time  interval  At  at  the  in- 
crement  At  or  at  increments  At/2  or  At/4  or  At/n,  with  corresponding  spot 
moves  AS,  AS/2,  and  so  on.  The  expected  P/L  would  be  more  precise  the 
smaller  the  adjustment  period,  but  it certainly  would  not  vary. 

The  key to  understanding  Ito’s  calculus  is  knowing  that  there  is  a  lag be- 
tween  the  decision  to  rebalance  and  the  final  execution  price  and  such  lag  is 
never  eradicated. 

In  fact,  the  costs  of  hedging  are  V2/m  V(AS)?  times  the  amount  of time 
spent  swinging  between S and  S$ +  AS,  the  resulting  volatility,  since  the  trader 
hedges  himself  after  the  move  AS  and  thus  loses  the  absolute  value  of AS times 
the  face  value. 

This  figure  illustrates  the  rebalancing  strategy  issue.  In  practical  terms,  the 
amount  of times,  he would  have  to  pay  the  transaction  costs  of one  tick  between 
1.5000  and  1.5001  in  USD-DEM  is equal  to  the  amount  of time  he  would  pay 
the  transaction  costs  of  100  ticks  between  1.5000  and  1.5100.  For  the  market 
will  snap  more  often  between  1.5000  and  1.5001  in  a  compensating  way.

Intuitively,  the  trader  can  truly  derive  an  option  price  as  the  expected 
rebalancing  at  the  strike.  An  out-of-the-money  option  is  less  likely  to  whip 
around  the  strike  because  the  strike  is away  from  the  center  of the  distribution. 

First  Conclusion:  The  costs  of replicating  an  option  (assuming  no  transac- 
tion  costs)  by buying  the  entire  face  value  at  the  strike  or  by continuously 
rebalancing  the  delta  are  expected  to  be the  same.  They  will  correspond  to 
the  Black-Scholes-Merton  value. 

Second  Conclusion  (food  for  thought):  In  some  cases,  the  wrinkles  of the 
market  favor  the  strategy  of hedging  with  discrete  increments  and  execut- 
ing  the  full  face  value.  Markets  supported  by  central  banks  will  cross 
the  intervention  level  and  not  return.  Likewise,  in  serially  correlated  mar- 
kets,  some  chartists  and  voodoo  traders  enjoy  being  short  delta  below 
some  level  and  long  above  it.

DDELTADVOL  (STABILITY  Ratio) 

pice ierctes re  seteseeres 

ogiieey 

Ddeltadvol  corresponds  to  the  changes  in deltas  resulting  from  changes 
in volatility  levels. 

The  reader  can  decide  whether  weighted  or  unweighted  volatility  needs  to 
be used.  The  concept  is similar  to  that  of the  bleed  except  that  it can  move  in 
two  directions. (Volatility moving  up  exerts  the  effect  of  the  reversing  of 
time  on  an  option  portfolio.  Likewise  volatility  moving  down  causes  the 
time  to  shorten  and  carries  exactly  the  same  effect  as  the  bleed.  The  effect  of 
the  moves  _in  volatility  over  the  portfolio  is  called  the  forward  and  back- 
ward  bleed,)At  a  more  advanced  level;  a  portfolio,  made  up  of spreads  can- 
not  be  projected  through  time  without  the  testing  of the  effect  of both  the 
bleed  and  the  Ddeltadvol.  The  trader  can  thus  only run  a  scenario  of a  series 
of paths  with  changes  in implied  volatility  and  reprice  the  portfolio  as  if he 
remained  risk  neutral  in  hewing  to  a  delta-neutral  strategy.  Because  the 
delta  neutrality  will  depend  on  the  volatility  at  the  rebalancing  point,  the 
exercise  is called  a  path-dependent  portfolio  testing. 

Test  1 of  Stability 

e 

/  The trader  should  raise  the  volatility  and  examine  the  first  derivatives,  par- 
ticularly  the  delta. An  increase  in  the  deltas  means  that  the  position  be- 
comes  increasingly  longer  vegas  in  a  rally  and  shorter  in a sell-off.  It  is 
called  a  positive  Ddeltadvol.  It  means  that  the  book  is  net  short options, 
below  the  money  and  net  long  option  above the money.  A  negative  Ddelta- 
ee ee 
dvol  means  the  reverse. 

Example:  A  simple  vertical  spread  is  the  most  likely  candidate  for  in- 
stability,  curiously.  If the  operator  is long a  100  call  and  short  a  110  call, 
the  deltas.will  shorten  with  Test  1(  Higher  volatility  would  raise  the

The  forward  bleed  is  the  effect  of  time  with  the  expiration  becoming 
shorter.  It consists  in  moving  the  portfolio  one  day  hence. 
The  backward  bleed  i is  the  effect  of  time  in  reverse,  as  if the  book  went 
back  in  time.  It is similar  to  the  notion  of reverse  time  decay.  The increase 
in volatility  exerts  such  an  effect  on  the  non-interest  component  of an  op- 
tion  price.

This  test  needs  to  be  run  routinely  on  books  in  emerging  market 
currencies,  the  biased  assets  and  other  products  where  it not  advisable  to 
be  short  volatility  when  the  market  decreases.  It presents  the  benefit  of 
being  simpler  to  perform  than  those  tests  that  require  matrices.  The 
reader  should  note  that  this  test  tells  little  about  the  gamma;  it can  only 
explain  the  sensitivity  of the  vega  to  the  skew. 

Test  2 of  Stability:  The  Asymptotic  Vega  Test 

Repeating  the  preceding  test  at  different  levels  of  the  underlying  asset 
could  show  the  different  exposures  at  various  levels  of  the  topography. 
Sometimes  the  vega  “flips”  when  the  market  rallies  above  or  drops  below  a 
cutting  point.  Such  reversal  is usually  caused  by the  clustering  of options  in 
one  location  dominating  a  particular  area.  That  cluster,  in  turn  would  be 
dominated  by another  one  further  away  from  the  money.  Figure  11.6  shows 
such  behavior. 

enn  One  is  long  the  110  calls  in  $100  million,  short  the  130  calls 
in 300  million.  When  the  volatility  is sufficiently  low  and  the  market  re- 
mains  between  100  and  115,  the  book  would  exhibit  long  vegas.  This 
would  appear  in  a  positive  Ddeltadvol  Test.  At  higher  volatility  levels, 
however,  the  test  would  reverse  and  show a negative  Ddeltadvol. 

In  the  preceding  example,  the  vegas  appear  jagged.  An  abrupt  rise  in 
volatility,  however,  would  turn  the  vegas  to  monotonously  short  across  the 
entire  spectrum.  This  is called  the  asymptotic  vega  test,  which  is only per- 
formed  for  stress  testing  as  it gives  way  out-of-the-money  options  undue 
importance.

MOMENTS  OF  AN  OPTION  POSITION 

Moments  for  a  distribution  are  ways  mathematicians  characterize  some  of 
its higher  order  behavior.  What  the  author  calls  moments  for  a  position  cor- 
responds  to  the  sensitivity  of an  option  book  to  the  higher  moments  of the 
distribution(The  modern  financial  approach  of relying  on  a  normal  distri- 
bution  allows 
theoreticians  to  ignore  its  higher  moments.  The  reason  is that 
the  normal  distribution  is entirely  characterized  by its  first  two  moments— 
the  mean  and  volatility.  A  compact  distribution  is  defined  (see  Ingersoll, 
1986)  as  a  distribution  the  higher  moments  of  which  become  increasingly 
small  in  relation  to  the  second  moment.  “Compact  support”  can  be  seen  in 
the  tails  of the  bell  curve  that  come  rapidly  close  to  0. 
refore,  in  theory, 
(via the delta) 
an  option  trader  will  only be exposed to the market  direction 
and  the  market  volatility  (through  the  gamma).  Higher derivatives  should 
not  truly  matter. 

Tere,

Too  bad.  Given  that  the  true  world  distributions  do  not  entirely  look  nor- 
mal  (except  by accident)  we  need  to  worry  about  fat  tails,  positive  and  nega- 
tive  skew,  jumps,  and  other  annoying  matters.  We  will  therefore  stretch  the 
mathematical  language  by using  the  designation  moment  for  a  position  in- 
stead  of a  distribution.

The  moments  of  an  option  position’  represent  the  sensitivity  to  some 
order  of  change  in the underlying  security.  The  more  information  about  the 
higher  moments,  the  more  able  the  trader  would  be  to  track  the  position 
and  predict  the  changes  over  a  wider  range  of prices. 

The  way  operators  look  at  the  moments  in  their framework  of analysis 
concerns  the  orders  of  move  in  the  asset price  with  time  kept constant{  So 
the  method  of moments reveals little about  the vega and its changes  and  the 
sensitivity  to  time.)

third  moment  will  be  positive.  It will  be  otherwise  negative.) (It be-

gamma  increases  when  the  market  moves  away  from  the  center  and

Probabilists  usually  ignore  higher  moments  since  those  vanish  very 
rapidly.  However,  option  traders,  surprisingly,  do  not.  It is their  business  to 
deal  with  the  fine  tuning  of the  option  position  at  higher  moments.  So  one 
probabilist  choked  at  a  mathematical  finance  conference  while  listening  to 
two  option  traders  argue  during  lunch  about  the  seventh  moment  of a  dis- 
tribution  (indeed a true  story). 

An  option  book  being  spread  out  between  items  at  all  the  possible 
time  and  space  points  of the  distribution  will  become  very  sensitive  to  the 
moments  of moments,  and  endlessly  so,  even  without  adding  the  beastly 
compound  option  structures.  This  is  because  traders  tend  to  maintain  a 
delta-neutral,  gamma-neutral  book  with  thousand  of  strikes  netting  out. 
Canceling  the  lower  moments  (locally)  is  rather  easy  (one  phone  call  to 
take  care  of  the  first  two  moments).  Canceling  the  next  5,000  moments, 
however,  would  necessitate  closing  down  the  book.  Going  down  the  risk 
management  positions  shows  why  option  traders  make  good  probability 
experts: 

XW  The  Fifth  Moment. 

It  becomes  the  asymmetry  sensitivity 

of  the 

fourth  moment. A portfolio  solely  DR  remaay  aaa nene  em 
rier option hedged with  a  short  vanilla  option  will  therefore  be  ex- 
tremely  sensitive  to  the  fifth  moment.  It will  increase  in concavity  as 
the  market  comes  closer  to  the  barrier  and  will  act  more  linear  as  the 
market  moves  away  from  it. 

¢  The  Sixth  Moment. 

Except  for  compound  options,  even  moments  do 

not  seem  to be  very  beastly. 

el The  Seventh  Moment.  ahs the  sign  of the  convexity  changes  as  the 
underlying  asset  moves

constructed  with  higher  order  out-of-the-money  options  one  side  of 
the  market  (only  out-of-the-money  calls  on  calls)  against  at-the- 
money  options  of an  inferior  order  (e.g.,  a  vanilla  at-the-money)  will 
have  a  seventh  moment  that  is very  pronounced.  In  the  call  on  calls 
case  versus  at-the-money,  the  convexity  will  slide  down  and  hit  zero. 
Where  someone  buys  out-of-the-money  calls  on  calls  and  sells  out-of- 
the-money  puts  on  calls  (delta  neutral,  of  course),  the  seventh  mo- 
ment  will  be very  scary. 

With  compound  options,  traders  can  thus  reach  seriously  higher  orders  of 
moments.  An  installment  option  (a fifth-order  compound  option),  we  will 
see,  requires  an  analysis  that  takes  into  account  at  least  nine  moments  for 
hedging  stability.

will  present  trading  difficulties. 

_  fot example,  a  delta-neutral  risk  reversal  will  appear  to  be  harmless  for 
anyone  stopping  at  the  delta  and  gamma.  However,  the  skew  can  have  a 
drastic  effect  on  the  P/L.  The  skew  can  be more  volatile  than  the  second  mo- 
ment,  and  this  is also  true  for  fourth  moment  positions. 

IGNORING  HIGHER  GREEKS:  THE  LOCK  DELTA 

Stress-testing  a  portfolio  is  a must  in risk  management.  Although  it is a  ca- 
sual,  uncomplicated  method,  it  proves  effective  for  micromanagement  of 
the  risks  when  one  looks  into  only  a  single  asset  in  an  independent  portfo- 
lio  of options. 

ma The  lock  delta,  or  asymptotic  delta method  is  a  naeasurement  of  the 
riskSin  a derivatives  portfolio  at  extreme  boundaries,  generally,  zero  or 
the  infinite.  The  principal  use  of  the  asymptotic  delta  is  to  display  the 
structure  of the  position  that  is hidden  by scenario  analysis. 

Option  Wizard:  Parametric  and  Nonparametric  Tests 

The  market  parameters  being  considerably  unstable,  it  is  always  necessary  to 
perform  tests  that  are  independent  of  the  distribution.  The  Lebanese  lira,  for 
example,  is-pegged  to  the  dollar  most  of the  time  and  often  jumps  after  some 
political  mishap.  Even  the  notions  of  fat  tails  and  skew  are  hardly  applicable 
owing  to  the  extreme  non-normality  of  the  market.  Using  Greeks  such  as 
gamma  represent  dangers.  The  tests  performed  on  a  portfolio  containing  such 
assets  need  to  be  entirely  street-smart,  with  simple  scenarios  (e.g.,  If the  cur- 
rency  moves  down  to  such a level,  what  is my  P/L?). 
/ 

A nonparametric  test  is  defined  as  one  where  no  assumptions  are  made 
“about  the  distribution  (and  its  parameters).  There is  an  entire  branch  of statis- 
tics  called “robust”  that  deals  with  such  issues.  Stress  tests  fall  into  the  non- 
parametric  category. 

It  is  necessary  in  poorly  behaved  instruments  like  emerging  market  debt 
where  the  distribution  and  its  parameters  (especially  volatility)  are  so  unstable 
as  to  make  the  conventional  risk  management  tools  inadequate. 

The  Greeks  and  Their  Behavior 

205 

Other  partial  derivatives  than  the  delta  are  by  definition  zero  at  these 
oundaries:  The  portfolio  then  ceases  to  behave  like  a  derivatives  portfolio. 
As  such,  its  sensitivity  to  volatility  will  be  nil:  Its  gamma  and  vega  will  be 
zero,  In  that  respect,  calling  the  measure  a  delta  can  be  an  exaggeration. 
Thé  measure  is the  netting of the underlying  if all  options  were  exercised.  It 
can literally 
be done on a napkin  for  positions  that do not include  exotic  op- 
tions  and  correlation  products.  One  can  count  the  net  number  of calls,  add 
them  to  the  cash  and  futures,  present  value  them,  and  translate  the  number 
into  asymptotic  maximum  up-deltas.  Conversely,  one  can  do  the  same  with 
puts  and  come  up  with  the  maximum  down-deltas. 

The  firms  that  survive  large shocks  in the 
Risk  Management  Rule: 
market  (and  the  breakdown  of convential  associations  between  in- 
struments)  are  the  ones  lucky  enough  not  to  have  “scientific”  risk 
managers  among  their  staff. 

Experienced  risk  managers  do  not  take  the  heavy  models  too  seriously. 
The  key for  survival  resides  in  distinguishing  between  risk  managers  who 
believe  in models,  and  those  confident  enough  not  to.

as  shown  in  Figure  11.9. 

Before  option  market  makers  discovered  the  simulation  matrices,  the  sys- 
tem  was  principally  asymptotic  delta-related:  The  clearing  firm  measured 
the  net  difference  between  upside  and  downside  risk  and  charged  the  cus- 
tomer  a  margin  in accordance  with  the  net  residual  exposure,  which  is that  of 
the  asymptotic  delta.  A covered  writer  was  absolved  of margin,  but  the  sale  of 
an  additional  call  (a one-by-two  covered  write)  caused  the  margin  to  become 
that  of a  naked  call.  The  clearing  firms  then  were  not  interested  in  the  math- 
ematics  of option  pricing  and  did  not  concern  themselves,  to  their  protection, 
with  Greek  derivatives.

The  mentality  of nonmathematical  equity  option  traders  was  then  en- 
tirely  pragmatic:  Stocks  used  to  experience  sudden  harrowing  jumps  on 
takeover  rumors  and  experienced  unstable  volatility,  with  brief  discontinu- 
ous  movements  following  company  news  and  announcements.  Survival  in- 
stinct  prevented  the  early participants  from  putting  much  trust  in formulas

watchdog  protection  of  a  narrow-minded  exchange  to  protect  them  from 
the  nonstatistical  risks. 

The  asymptotic  delta  risk  loses  its  significance  in  the  case  of  dynamic 
hedging,  as  it  does  not  take  into  account  the  hedging  of  the  position  be- 
tween  points.  Conversely,  the  asymptotic  delta  risk  measurement  does  not 
reveal  the  risk  of whipsaw  that  could  range  far  in  excess  of the  amounts  dis- 
closed.  In  brief,  it only  discloses  the  risk  from  events  where  the  trader  does 
not  have  time  to  hedge.

An  option  proverb 

FUNGIBILITY 

_  J 

Fungibility refers  to  the  degree  of specificity  required  for  the  satisfac- 
tion  of the  deliverability  obligation.  A highly  fungible  commodity is  an 
abstract  one  and  could  be  created  electronically  (like  a  swap).  A  non- 
fungible  one  is specific  and  cannot  be  created  at  wfll,  such  as  livestock 
that  requires  the  delivery  of a  cow  at  a  specific  place  at  a  specific  time. 

From  the  vantage  point  of financial  theory,  fungibility  reflects  the  feasibil- 
ity of risk-neutral  replication  of a  derivative  security. 

Fungibility  of  a commodity  represents  the  degree  of dependence  on  time 
and  space  for  the  delivery  process.  This  issue  prevents  theoreticians  from 
reaching  a  generalized  derivatives-pricing  model,  as  it  shows  how  deep 
differences  between  products  could  be.  Some  commodities  are  totally 
theoretical  and  intangible  (an  inflation  index),  others  are  palpable  and 
specific. 

the market 
Whenever  there  are  two  instruments  in  the  same  category,

because  the  operators 
do  not  have  the  specificity  of a  particular  bond  to  borrow  (despite  the  con- 
version  optionality).  Likewise,  swaps  are  better  arbitraged  than  bonds. 

more  interesting  than  cash  bonds 

Example:  A  contract  specifying  for  the  deliverability  of  calves  of 
some  detailed  species  becomes  subjected  to  the  dynamics  of  supply 
and  demand  for  that  particular  specification.  Sometimes  open  interest 
exceeds  the  number  of  animals  alive  of  that  specification,  causing  an 
imbalance  between  longs  and  shorts.  The  owners  of  the  underlying 
asset,  typically  seasoned  traders  with  a  vast  experience  of the  squeez- 
ing  process,  will  accumulate  the  physical  and  force  delivery  of  the 

208 

Fungibility,  Convergence,  and  Stacking 

209 

underlying.  Within  the  narrow  time  window  available,  it becomes  im- 
possible  to  create  animals  from  scratch,  regardless  of the  money  avail- 
able.  The  owners  of the  physical  typically  know  it and  would  not  fail  to 
benefit  from  it.  The  squeeze  will  last  until  open  interest  numbers  drop 
to  the  physical  ceiling. 

Ranking  of Fungibility 

Commodities  can  be  classified  between  two  extremes:  totally  fungible  and 
delivery  specific. 

e  Anextremely  fungible  commodity  is a  currency  that  a bank  can  create 
electronically  and  wire  anywhere  in  the  world.  The  only  restriction 
becomes  exchange  control,  the  establishment  of hindrances  to  convert- 
ibility,  something  no  longer  common  with  the  currencies  of the  indus- 
trialized  world.  Being  able  to  wire  currency  instantaneously  without 
any  restriction  removes  it from  the  time  or  place  restrictions.  This  has 
a  momentous  effect  on  the  term  structure  of prices. 

e  At  the  other  extreme  lies  a  physical  commodity  that  needs  to be deliv- 
ered  at  one  specific  location.  The  location  specificity  subjects  arbi- 
trage  to  shipping  considerations.  It  is  therefore  possible  to  see  the 
same  commodity  with  the  same  grade  trading  at  two  different  prices 
at two  different  locations  at the  same  moment  because  of the  shipment 
costs  and  time.  Spot  oil  can  trade  for  18.23  for  3-day  delivery  in  the 
New  York  harbor  and  18.75  for  the  same  delivery  date  of the  grade  in 
Rotterdam.  Since  moving  inventory  at  an  acceptable  price  within  the 
deadline  of the  delivery  is impossible,  a  certain  margin  between  secu- 
rities  will  be  allowed.  For  the  right  price,  however,  someone  would 
charter  a  Concorde  and  fly any  shipment  anywhere. 

Nonfungibility  makes  elements  of one  grade  trade  at  a  different 
price  than  those  of another  grade.  Time  and  place  restrictions  oper- 
ate  in  more  than  one  way.  Storage  can  involve  such  costs  that  those 
holding  a  product  in  the  ground  would  dictate  the  marginal  carry  of 
the  commodity. 

Oil  in  the  ground  does  not  really  cause  the  owner  to  incur 
Example: 
any  direct  physical  carrying  cost.  If the  owner  is  a  government  that  is 
not  chartered  to  sell  a  chunk  of the  homeland,  no  financial  carry  is usu- 
ally  taken  into  consideration.  On  the  other  hand  an  individual  who 
owns  the  land  could  always  make  a  comparison  between  its  future  mar- 
ket  value  and  the  investment  of  the  proceeds  in  some  treasury  bill. 
Someone  with  no  marks-to-market  has  no  real  financing  cost  to  take 
into  consideration. 

210 

Measuring  Option  Risks 

So  there  is no  true  force  to  prop  up  the  price  of the  forward,  except, 
of  course,  the  behavior  of  the  real  users  who  can  buy  long  dated  for- 
wards  to  lock  in  the  price  of future  needs,  which,  for  trading  purposes, 
can  be  deemed  at best  negligible.  The  forward  price  can  therefore  trade 
at  a  much  lower  price  than  cash,  and  the  difference  between  the  cash 
and  the  future  can  fluctuate  wildly  without  any  trader  having  the  guts 
to  confront  the  market. 

Often  the  commodity  can  escape  all  rules  when  it comes  to  a 
Example: 
perishable  or  live  animal.  No  financial  power  can  electronically  create  a 
live  animal  (not  yet given  the  state  of genetic  engineering)  or  extend  its 
life beyond  term  to  make  a  long-term  forward  delivery.

The  Cash-and-Carry  Line 

Risk  Management  Rule:  A calendar  spread  in  options  on  cash  as- 
sets  in  less  fungible  commodities  needs  to  be  decofhposed  into  its 
different  components  and  analyzed  separately. 

‘ 

The  prices  follow  the  following  curve:  If  a commodity  one  year  hence  be- 
comes  too  expensive  relative  to  the  spot,  an  arbitrageur  can  buy  the  cash, 
compute  proper  carrying  costs  (both  financial  and  physical  storage),  then 
sell  the  future  to lock  in a profit.  This  puts  an  upper  boundary  on  the  future 
costs,  provided  the  commodities  do  not  go  through  deterioration  through 
time.  This  upper  boundary  is called  the  maximum  contango  (see Figure  12.1).

Example:  A  commodity  is  trading  at  $20.00  per  unit,  incurring  storage 
(and  insurance)  costs  of  8%  annualized  and  fixed.  The  maximum  con- 
tango  line  will  espouse  the  shape  of the  yield  curve  for  interest  rates  plus 
the  storage  costs.  It is not  possible  for  a commodity  to  exceed  the  line,  but 
the  yield  curve  can  take  any  shape  underneath  it (see  Figure  12.1). 

So  commodities  are  split into: 

¢  Those  that  can  only be arbitraged  one-way  on  the  time  line,  like  most 

physical  commodities. 

e  Those  that  can  be  arbitraged  two-way,  like  currencies  and  liquid  eq- 

uities  and  fixed  income  instruments. 

¢  Those  that  are  not  arbitrageable  on  the  time  line,  like  all  perishable 

products.

Fungibility  and  Option  Arbitrage 

Option  arbitrage  consists  principally  in synthetically  moving  the  liquidity  of 
one  instrument  against  another,  that  is  trading  between  the  liquidity  of  the 
products.  A  fungible  product  will  subscribe  to  the  line  F(t)  =  F(0)  +  Carry, 
with  most  Greeks  of  the  forward  fungible  with  those  of  the  cash,  plus  or 
minus  a variance.  The  initial  Greeks  such  as  delta  and  gamma  can  be used  for 
the  cash  or  the  future  interchangeably. 

Another  way  is  to  consider  the  structure  of  correlation  between  the 
products.  A  high  correlation  matrix  will  lead  to  a  spreadable  volatility 
curve.  A  low  correlation  matrix  requires  the  bucketing  of  expirations  as 
semiindependent  products. 

e stability  of second  derivatives  will  be  higher  than  first  ones,  and  so 
,  as  one  goes  into  higher  order  differentials.  This  means  that  if the  deltas 
of  the  9-month  does  not  properly  hedge  that  of  the  3-month,  the  gamma 
hedges  will  be more  stable.  The  DgammaDspot  will  be even  more  stable  and 
so  forth.  A  trader  should  initially  square  up  his  delta  in  each  expiration, 
then  concentrate  on  the  gammas,  and  so  on. 

A  trader  who  is long  a  1-year  call  and  short  a  2-year  call  in  oil  should 
first  do  a  1-year/2-year  swap  or  its  equivalent.  He  willend  up  with  resid- 
ual  delta  in  the  rallies  as  he  will  get  longer  the  1-year  forward  and  short 
the  2-year.  He  then  will  have  to  square  up  the  in¢gremental  deltas  back  and 
forth. 

This  leads  to  the  following  rule: 

Risk  Management  Rule: 
Option  arbitrage  cannot  be  performed  in 
markets  that  do  not  have  a  risk-neutral  forward  market.  The  for- 
ward  needs  to  be  perfectly  arbitrageable  for  the  option  operator  to 
feel  confident  about  his  activities  there. 

Changes  in  the  Rules  of the  Game 

Currencies  appear  to  be  arbitrageable  on  both  sides  of the  forward  line.  At 
times  of crisis,  however,  a  currency  under  siege  can  command  high interest 
rates  or  might  turn  out  to  be  unobtainable.  An  operator  will  still  be  able  to 
deliver  it and  incur a liability  but  covering  that  liability  by borrowing  the 
currency  overnight  could  prove  onerous.  The  Irish  punt  commanded  4000% 
overnight  interest  rates  during  the  1992  financial  crisis.  The  central  bank’s 
stated  objective  was  to make  it as  difficult  as  possible  to borrow,  “to  give the 
speculators  a  lesson.”  The  Spanish  peseta  after  a  weakening  against  the 
other  European  currencies  will  become  tight  as  many  short  sellers  need  to

domestic  and  the  offshore  (or Euro)  markets. 

Figure  12.2  represents  the  curve  of cattle  prices. 
Example.  Live  Cattle: 
As  expected,  the  curve  does  not  exhibit  any  smoothness:  It is difficult  to 
transfer  a  live  animal  into  December  1996,  when  the  animal  could  be- 
come  sick. 

The  volatility  is  difficult  to  gauge  owing  to  the  illiquidity  of  the 
back  month.  Whereas  it is  the  rule  for  a  fungible  product  that  the  price 
of a  back  month  at-the-money  (forward)  straddle  to be at  least  that  of the 
price  of a  straddle  of a  shorter  expiration  (minus  financing),  such  a  re- 
striction  does  not  apply  to  such  instruments.  The  straddle  in  the  back 
month  could  trade  at  a  lower  price  than  that  in  the  front  without  any 
possible  arbitrage. 

CONVERGENCE 

M  Convergence  trading’  is  any  form  of speculative  position  taking  based 
on  the  belief  that  the  (risk-adjusted)  term  structure  of a  security  or  its 
derivatives  (interest  rate  yields,  volatility,  gamma  costs,  etc.)  does  not 
represent  a  completely  unbiased  predictor  of the  future. 

Securities  are  supposed  to  include  some  bias  in  proportion  to  their  risk  (in 
the  form  of covariance  with  the  market  or  liquidity  constraints).  Typically, 
financial  market  equilibrium  would,  according  to  theory,  represent  a  bal- 
ance  between  the  drift  of  a  security  and  its  risk  premium.  However,  Wall 
Street  does  not  hold  a  coherent  and  stable  belief  in  risk  premiums  and 
would  therefore  consider  a  carry  to  be  whatever  disagrees  with  their  vision 
of the  future  price. 

214 

Measuring  Option  Risks 

Example:  An  imaginary  commodity  future  with  an  extremely  high 
drift: 

Spot price:  100. 

1-month  price:  110 
2-month  price:  125 

3-month  price:  145 

The  structure  of the  financial  markets  indicates  that  (assuming  no  risk 
premium  for  the  commodity)  the  price  of the  instrument  should  pick up  10 
cents  in the  next  month.  This  is called  the  “ride  up” on  the  curve.  It implies 
that  the  expected  price  1 month  from  now  is  110,  2 months  from  now  125, 
and  so  on. 

¢  First-Order  Convergence. 

An  operator  who  shorts  the  one-month  fu- 
ture  can  expect  that  if the  security  does  not  drop  by $10.00  a  month, 
.33  a  day,  he  will  benefit  from  the  positive  convergence  of  his  trade. 
This  operation  is called  first-order  convergence,  as  it seems  risky. 

¢  Second-Order  Convergence. 

The  operator  who  prefers  not  to  incur 
the  risks  of  a  naked  short  position  would  engage  in  a  spread.  He 
would  buy  the  1-month  forward  at  110  and  sell  the  2-month  at  125. 
That  way  he  can  consider  that  he  reduced  his  directional  risk  (as- 
suming  the  two  instruments  are  highly  correlated). 

¢  Butterfly  Convergence. 

A  shrewder  operator,  provided  he  can  ac- 
cess  markets  without  incurring  high transaction  costs,  would  look  at 
the  previous  trade  and  consider  the  trader  rather  naive.  The  trade 
leaves  the  person  exposed  to  the  shifts  in  the  curve  generally  result- 
ing  from  imperfect  correlation  between  instruments.  So  he  adds  a 
twist:  a  butterfly. 

He  buys  the  second  month  twice  and  sells  the  first  and  third 
month  against  them,  thus  achieving  some  relative  safety  from  moves 
in  the  marketplace.  This  is called  two-factor  immunization:  The  first 
the  slope  of the  curve.  The  op- 
one  is the  direction,  the  second  one  is 
erator  leaves  himself  only  exposed 
to  the  convexity  in  the  shape  of 
the  curve. 

There  is  a Wall  Street  continuous  dilemma  between  those  who  believe  that 
the  future  converges  to  spot  and  those  who  believe  that  the  spot  “decon- 
verges”  to  the  future.  In other  words,  the  question  is whether  the  curve  cor- 
responds  to  some  utility  function,  some  structural  condition,  or  to  market 
expectations.  Many  operators  make  different  judgments  at  different  times 
depending  on  the  information  available  in  the  market.  They  may  believe  in 
convergence  at  some  times,  say  in  the  absence  of a  central  bank  policy  and 
subscribe  to  the  expectation  belief  at  other  times.

Option  Wizard:  Carry  versus  Convergence 

One  should  not  confuse  carry  and  convergence.  Convergence  includes  carry. 
Carry  corresponds  to  the  cash  flow  differential  between  instruments  or  the  dif- 
ference  between  an  instrument  and  the  cost  of  holding  it  (or  the  “risk-free” 
rate  according  to  financial  theory).  Convergence  is calculated  by repricing  the 
instrument  with  a  decrease  on  the  term  structure  in  addition  to  the  carry. 

Most  sophisticated  convergence  calculations  take  into  account  seasonal 

factors,  such  as  year-end  liquidity. 

Mapping  Convergence 

For  a  Fixed-Income  Instrument. 

Dollar  convergence  is equivalent  to: 

Carry  +  Drop  on  the  curve  in basis  points 

The  drop  on  the  curve  should  be  computed  in  by breaking  down  the  cash 
flows  of  every  instrument  and  repricing  them  on  the  zero-curve  with  one 
day shorter  to  go. 

For  a  Eurodollar  Future. 
more  easily  computed  in  two  ways: 

There  is  no  carry.  The  drop  on  the  curve  can  be 

1.  The  easy  way  is by interpolating  the  straight  line  difference  between 
contracts  and  repricing  the  instrument  as  if it were  one  day shorter. 
2.  The  more  accurate  method  is to  use  the  polynomial  approximation  for 
the  time  function  or  the  spline  in  order  to  avoid  abrupt  changes  in 
convergence.  The  price  of the  securities  would  be  replaced  by the  sea- 
sonal  adjusted  one.  The  December  future,  for  example,  would  be 
purged  of  the  liquidity  premium.  (Year-end  interest  rates  are  often 
higher  because  of balance  sheet  requirements.  Operators  need  to  take 
such  effect  into  account.) 

For  a  Currency  Cash  Position. 
For  a  currency  cash  position,  carry  is 
the  convergence.  It  is  estimated  by  checking  the  overnight  interest  rate 
differential. 

For  a  Currency  Forward. 
A currency  forward  is only  a  currency  spot  po- 
sition  plus  two  fixed  income  zero-coupon  positions,  one  long  and  the 
other  short. 

216  Measuring  Option  Risks 

The  convergence  would  be priced  as  the  spot carry  plus the  difference  in 

the  effects  in the  drop  on  the  curve  in each  of the  two  instruments. 

\ 

Se 

Convergence  and  Convexity 

Often  time  decay  can  be  mistaken  for  convergence.  Instruments  that  _pre- 
sent  a  high  convexity 

will  often  have  a  theta  built  into  them. 

The  bond  future  includes  an  option  to  choose  between a variety  of de- 
liverables.  Estimating  its  convergence  would  require  some  adjustment  to 
take  into  account  the  “time  decay”  of the  embedded  option. 

Securities  of the  Government  National  Mortgage  Association  (GNMAs) 
need  to  be  priced  on  an  option-adjusted  basis.  The  owner  of  the  structure 
has  a  high  level  of negative  convexity  in his  books. 

Levels  of Convergence  Trading 

¢  First-Order  Convergence  Trading. 

The  positive  carry  trade.  Owning 

a  bond  because  of its  carry. 

¢  Second-Order  Convergence  Trading. 

The  forward-forward.  Playing 

the  carry  differential  between  two  maturities. 

¢  Third-Order  Convergence  Trading. 

Butterflies,  barbells. 

¢  Fourth-Order  Convergence  Trading. 

Double  butterflying,  running  a 

minimum  variance  stacking  program.  (See  next  section.) 

Volatility  and  Convergence 

Many  speculators  (called  “carry  hogs”)  are  attracted  by “positive  carry”  in- 
struments.  Typically,  these  instruments  will  exhibit  a  skew  behavior  with  a 
strong  volatility  in  the  event  of  a  sell-off.  Often  the  holder’s  premium  is 
only  a  compensation  for  the  holding  risks. 

Convergence  and  Biased  Assets 

There  was  a  corny  theory  on  Wall  Street  that  assets,  particularly  those  of 
foreign  countries  that  carried  a  high  return  were  attractive  on  a risk- 
adjusted  basis.  True,  these  assets  were  deemed  risky,  but  they  presented  a 
better  than  average  risk/return.  Returns  were  deemed  to  be  convergence. 
Risks  were  interpreted  as  their  historical  volatility.  Traders  who  traded  in 
that  manner  were  in  their  own  eyes  sellers  of  expensive  insurance.  The 
method  extended  to  diversification  techniques  where  uncorrelated  high- 
yielding  products  were  bundled  in  a  package  that  would  present  what  ap- 
peared  to be  abnormal  returns. 

Needless  to  say,  those  traders  disappeared.  The  use  of  the  sacrosanct 
correlation  methods  caused  the  buildup  of  positions  in  currency  pairs  that 

Fungibility,  Convergence,  and  Stacking 

217 

appeared  to  be  highly  correlated  but  presented  a  very  high  carry/conver- 
gence.  Speculators  flocked  to  funds  that  did  the  following  trades: 

e  They  bought  the  Italian  lira,  which  commanded a high  interest  rate, 
and  borrowed  Dmarks,  which  carried  a  low  interest  rate,  and  were 
lulled  by the  protection  of the  European  Monetary  System. 

¢  They  bought  the  Scandinavian  currencies  against  the  DM  for  the 

same  reasons.  Historical  volatility  appeared  to be  low. 

e  They  invested  in  Mexican  fixed  income  assets  comforted  by some 
“pacto”  where  the  Mexican  government  committed  to  stabilize  the 
currency  within  a  band. 

These  assets  proved  to be heteroskedastic  (i.e., had  a  changing  volatility 
structure:  3-month  historical  moved  from  2%  to  50%)  and  presented  a 
skewed  behavior  in  the  bargain.  Massive  losses  ensued,  both  in  September 
1992  and  in  the  Mexican  debacle  of  1995.  Except  for  brief  periods,  however, 
the  fund  managers  and  traders  presented  outstanding  “Sharpe  ratios,”  a 

The  traders  collected  fees  and  bonuses  during  their  previous  years 

thanks  to  the  optionality  of their  payoff. 

STACKING  TECHNIQUES 

Stacking  is a  short-term  hedging  technique  that  aims  at  minimizing  the  ex- 
ecution  of  a  multiple  leg  hedge  by concentrating  on  a  few  liquid  instru- 
ments  that  track  the  position  best. 

Stacking  is best  used  as  a  transitory  hedge.  It is used  by cap/floor  and 
swap  traders  who  can  thus  hedge  the  residual  deltas  stemming  from  a 
market  move  (the  secondary,  gamma-related  hedges).  It  is  also  prized  by 
market  makers  unwilling  to  commit  time  to  the  fine  tuning  of a  position 
they may  not  carry  on  the  books  for  long.  It is also  practiced  in basket  trad- 
ing.  The  risks  of  stacking  increase  with  time:  Relationships  and  hedge 
ratios  change.  The  technique  of  stacking  is  not  meant  to  be  a  permanent 
hedge,  only  a  temporary  maneuver  around  the  liquidity  of  a  market. 
Stacking  a  position  permanently  can  cause  serious  troubles.  It is to  be  re- 
membered  that  Metalgessellshaft,  the  large  German  concern  that  experi- 
enced  a  ten-digit  loss  from  an  oil  hedge  gone  awry,  was  market  neutral  but 
had  stacked  all  its  exposure  in  the  front  future.’ 

Example.  The  Quick-and-Dirty  Hedge:  A trader  needs  to  rapidly  hedge 
a  two  year  strip  in the  Eurodollar  markets,  by selling  the  equivalent  of 95 
of each  of the  first  expiration  (for the  purpose  of simplification,  assume 
that  the  hedge  ratio  is  equal  in  each  maturity).  Given  the  volatility  of 
the  Eurodollar  markets,  he  may  need  to  do  it quickly.

¢  A Market-Neutral  Stack. 

An  easy  method  would  be  to  compute  the 
amount  of total  exposure,  that  is 760  contracts,  and  then  sell  them  all 
in one  expiration  to  ensure  market  neutrality.  The  trader  would  pick 
the  fourth  or  the  fifth  expiration  and  sell  760  contracts. 

e  A Butterflying  Stack. 

A  stack  that  would  offer,some  protection  for 

the  shifts  in  the  shape  in the  yield  curves. 

In Table  12.2,  the  net  exposure  corresponds  to the  risks  the  trader  has  on 

the  books  after  stacking. 

Traders  need  to  hedge  as  an  emergency.  Working  eight  orders  at  the 
same  time  can  cause  confusion,  partial  fills,  and  headaches  as  no  broker  can 
concentrate  on  all  the  expirations  at once.  Even  when  there  is a  market  for  a 
strip  as  a  spread,  bid /offer  are  wider  than  every  individual  leg. 

The  trader  needs  to  hedge  the  primary  risk  as  rapidly  as  possible,  then 

fine-tune  the  resulting  mismatch  by working  spreads  (Table  12.3). 

The  trader  could  further  lower  the  risks  by putting  spread  orders  in  the 
market  and  waiting  for  fills  to  come  at more  attractive  prices  than  if he  exe- 
cuted  it as  a  strip  (or less  unattractive  price,  as  is usually  the  case).  It could 
be  done  the  following  way:  Trader  can  buy  95  Eurol  against  Euro3,  buy  95 
Eurod  against  Euro7,  and  so  on,  thus  reducing  every  leg until  the  position 
becomes  entirely  flat. 

Example.  Minimum  Variance  Stacking: 
As  some  securities  do  not 
closely  track  each  other,  there  are  methods  of optimizing  a  hedge.  The 
correlation  matrix  can  be  used  to  search  for  the  best  combinations  or 
the  most  appropriate  stack. 

In the  preceding  example,  the  front  Eurodollar  future  does  not  track  the 
market  very  well.  The  back-month  futures,  on  the  other  hand,  are  almost  in- 
terchangeable.

The  computations  in  Table  12.4  are  based  on  one  year  of data  as  of May 
15,  1995.  ED1  is  the  perpetual  front-month  Eurodollar  contract,  ED2  the 
perpetual  second,  and  so  on. 

Volatility  is  the  annualized  standard  deviation  based  on  daily  log- 

returns. 

A single  stack,  as  shown  in Table  12.6,  reduces  the  position  to  28%  of the 

initial  risks. 

A  butterfly  stack  (Table  12.7)  reduces  the  risks  to  14%  of  the  initial 

position. 

A  stack  taking  advantage  of  the  full  power  of  the  correlation  between 
periods  reduced  the  risks  to  5%  of  the  initial  position  with  three  trades 
only:  The  trader  bought  95  ED1,  285  ED3,  and  380  ED4.  (See  Table  12.8.) 
Eliminating  the  first  month,  as  it does  not  correlate  to  the  rest  and  does  not 
have  a  similar  variance,  corresponds  to  the  bulk  of  the  reduction.  Because

An  old  option  proverb  (about  volatility  selling  prior  to  a weekend) 

EXPIRATION  PIN  Risks 

@  The  expiration  pin  risk  is  the  expiration  variance  for  an  options  posi- 
tion.  It  results  from  the  absence  of  timely  information  about  the  out- 
come  of the  option  assignment  lottery. 

There  is a  lag between  the  close  of an  option  market  and  the  notification  to 
the  parties  short  options  about  whether  or  not  they were  assigned.  The  lag is 
necessary  for  processing  reasons,  but  when  the  option  is  too  close  to  the 
money,  there  could  be  a  great  deal  of  uncertainty  about  the  outcome.  The 
pin prolongs  the  uncertainty  and  thus  the  life  of the  option,  but  sometimes 
creates  a  contingent  claim  that  is not  rewarded  for. 

Risk  Management  Rule: 
cash-settled  listed  options  (both  European  and  American). 

Put/Call  parity  does  not  hold  for  non- 

The  expiration  pin risk  could  be significant  when  the  operator  is involved  in 
a  conversion  or  a  reversal.  The  notification  of the  exercises  is due  at  least  24 
hours  before  the  answer  about  the  results  of the  assignment  process. 

Example: 
A  market  on a listed  exchange  is  closing  at  100  exactly.  The 
trader  is  short  the  100  calls,  long  100  puts  and  long  the  underlying  fu- 
ture—what  a  text  book  would  call  a  perfect  hedge  (the  so-called  conver- 
sion).  The  trader  does  not  know  whether  to  exercise  or  not.  Should  he 
exercise  all  his  puts  and  deliver  the  futures,  he  would  hope  that  the 
calls  get  entirely  abandoned.  Should  he  abandon  the  puts,  he  would 
wish  to  see  all  his  calls  exercised  so  he  can  deliver  his  futures.  The 
party  on  the  other  side  will  be  in  the  same  quandary.

What  makes  matters  even  more  complicated  is  that  a  closing  price  on  a 
future  is not  a  real  indication  as  to  where  the  market  will  be  at  the  times  of 
exercise.  The  future  closing  does  not  usually  terminate  the  option:  There  is a 
gap  of a  few  hours  in which  information  can  still  hit  the  markets  with  opera- 
tors  guessing  the  general  effect  of such  information  without  more  precision. 
In  the  preceding  example,  assume  that  the  future  closes  at  101  but  that 
after  the  close  news  of a  government  scandal  hits  the  market.  The  operator 
may  wonder  what  to  do  with  the  100  puts,  officially  out-of-the-money.  He 
knows  with  some  certainty  that  the  market  would  be  lower  if it were  open 
to  trade.  His  risks  are  that  he may  abandon  the  puts  and  not  be  assigned  on 
the  calls  with  the  market  opening  markedly  lower.  The  other  risks  are  that 
he  may  exercise  the  puts  and  still  be  assigned  on  his  calls,  with  the  market 
unchanged  if  the  news  is  subsequently  denied  after  the  deadline.  Often 
some  of  the  counterparties  with  a  large  open  interest  can  manipulate  the 
markets  and  turn  the  uncertainty  in  their  favor,  as  when  they  become  in 
possession  of a  large  sell  order  and  decide  to  exercise  options  deemed  out- 
of-the-money. 

Some  solutions  have  been  offered  by exchanges  to  reduce  pin risks,  none 
of them  satisfactory.  One  of them  is to  allow  conversion-reversals  to  be net- 
ted  provided  one  can  find  a  counterparty  that  has  exactly  opposite  sides. 

The  only  markets  where  a  conversion  or  a  reversal  is a  pure  arbitrage  is 
where  the  underlying  is a  cash-settled  future  that  expires  at  the  same  time 
as  the  option.  Examples:  Eurodollars,  Euromarks,  Pibor  (the  quarterly  op- 
tions),  SP500  (quarterly'). 

Warning:  Traders,  like  poets,  often  give  the  same  designation  to  two  dif- 
ferent  items.  “Pin  risk”  is  also  used  to  refer  to  the  P/L  swing  at  the  barrier 
for  a  portfolio  containing  barrier  options. 

STICKY  STRIKES 

M  Sticky  strikes  are  over-the-counter  or  listed  strikes  in  which  the 
buildup  of a  large  open  interest  alters  the  behavior  of the  market  around 
the  strike  price  near  expiration. 

Sticky  strikes  are  usually  magnified  by  the  concentration  of  the  long  or 
short  open  interest  in  the  hands  of  one  or  more  parties  that  do  not  delta 
hedge.  The  pressure  on  the  underlying  occurs  because  the  option  traders’ 
behavior  will  diverge  from  that  of the  customer. 

For  example,  if a  large  coverered  writer  is short  the  SP100  450  calls,  op- 
tion  traders  burdened  with  long  gamma  will  tend  to  buy  and  sell  around 
the  strike,  creating  to  their  detriment  some  stability  around  their  worst- 
case-scenario  price.  There  will  be  bids  underneath  the  strike  and  offers 
above.  Meanwhile,  the  party  short  the  largest  portion  remains  indifferent  to 

224  Measuring  Option  Risks 

the  market  being  only  interested  in  the  terminal  state  of in-the-moneyness 
or  out-of-the-moneyness. 

The  concentration  in  the  hands  of  a  nondelta  hedger  will  cause  such 
stickiness.  As  expiration  nears,  locals  will.need  to buy all  their  deltas  below 
and  sell  all  of them  above  and  the  underlying  will  tend  to  stick  around  the 
strike  until  some  fresh  supply  or  demand  pushes  it away.  If the  same  open 
interest  were  distributed  in  the  hands  of  market  makers,  the  stickiness 
would  be  greatly  reduced  as  there  would  be  two-way  orders  by long match- 
ing short  gamma. 

Typically  when  such a strike  is reached  on  expiration  day (and  there  are 
high  odds  of  having  a  strike  crossed),  it acts  as  an  absorbing  state  for  the 
market.  There  will  be  large  sellers  above  it if approached  from  below  and 
large buyers  underneath  it if approached  from  above. 

These  conditions  where  the  option’s  open  interest  determines  the  path 
of the  underlying  are  starting  to  emerge  as  many  customers  are  picking  de- 
rivatives  in  place  of  the  primary  securities.  Warrant  traders  are  most  sub- 
jected  to  that  effect  as  the  ratio  of secondary  delta  hedgers  to  total  traders 
there  is greatest. 

Note:  Cash  traders  complain  that  it is often  the  case  of the  tail  wagging 
the  dog. Very little  research  has  been  done  to  ascertain  tlre  impact  of expira- 
tions  on  the  behavior  of the  spot. 

There  is  a  saying  in  currency  options  markets,  where  daily  expirations 
tend  to  affect  the  behavior  of the  spot,  that  one  always  has  to  gain  from  sell- 
ing a cheap  overnight  option  or  buying  an  expensive  one.  When  overnight  op- 
tions  are  cheap,  the  market  will  be  stabilized  by the  traders  sucked  into  it. 
The  market  at  10:00  a.m.  New  York  will  converge  to  the  strike  should  spot be 
in the  vicinity.  Conversely,  the  market  will  whip when  options  are  expensive. 

Risk  Management  Rule:  When  dynamic  hedgers  are  long  a  strike 
(and  consequently,  static  hedgers  short  it) the  strike  will  be  sticky. 
It will  whip  otherwise. 

MARKET  BARRIERS 

@  A market  barrier  is a  level  that  is supposed  to  cause  some  stickiness  be- 

cause  of institutional  constraints.* 

Market  barriers  should  not  be  confused  with  barrier  options.  The  following 
are  examples  of market  barriers: 

e  A currency  band  where  central  banks  limit  the  market  from  trading 

through  some  level  by intervention. 

Some  Wrinkles  of Option  Markets

¢  A floor  for  the  price  of an  agricultural  commodity  guaranteed  by the 

government. 

Market  limits  that,  when  reached,  cause  the  exchange  to  shut  down  repre- 
sent  a  weaker  form  of market  barrier. 

A  Currency  Band:  Is  It a  Barrier? 

Some  economists  consider  that  market  barriers  should  cause  the  volatility 
to  be  dampened  in  their  proximity.  Somehow  the  claim  in  the  literature 
that  a  target  zone  is  heteroskedastic  proved  to  be  true,  but  exactly  in 
reverse.” 

Figure  13.1  shows  the  “rubber  trees”  shrinking  as  the  market  comes 
close  to  the  barrier.  Obviously,  a  market  at,  say,  20  pips  from  a  limit  cannot 
go  up  more  than  that.  To  compensate  for  that  fact  (assuming  constant 
skew),  it  should  be  limited  to  a  move  down  by  20  pips,  and  so  on.  The 
volatility  drops  as  one  comes  close  to  the  barrier,  and  the  asset  starts  “past- 
ing”  around  it. 

A  more  complex  analysis  would  increase  the  skew,  by saying  that  the 
market  on  the  way  down  would  be  able  to  drop  by more  than  20  cents  but 
that  the  probability  attached  to  it  should  be  low  to  satisfy  the  following 
“fair”  game  (assuming  for  simplification  that  interest  rates  are  negligible): 

pi  (pd 

with  p the  probability  for  the  market  to  go  up,  u  the  size  of the  up-move, 
(1  —  p)  the  probability  for  the  market  to  go  down  and d the  size  of  the 
down-move. 

Traders  do  not  buy  the  argument:  The  volatility  of the  forward  should  in- 
crease  dramatically  as  one  comes  close  to  the  band.  Every  time  the  markets 
approach  such  a  band,  some  warfare  erupts  between  speculators  and  central 
banks.  In  addition,  as  by some  phenomenon  physicists  call  hysteresis,  the  mar- 
kets  have  a  tendency  to  snap  through  the  barrier  with  a  vengeance.

The  Absent  Barrier 

Practitioners  discovered  (at  great  expense)  that  the.  reflecting  /absorbing 
barriers  set  as  boundaries  in  the  analysis  of currency  bands  turned  out  to 
be  optical  illusions.  Before  the  explosion  of the  European  Rate  Mechanism, 
there  was  a  great  deal  of literature  on  the  topic. 

Somehow  when  a  currency  reaches  a  band  in  the  spot,  which  is the  only 
observable  portion  of  the  trading,  the  forward  continues  to  trade  unfet- 
tered.  What  appears  to  be  extreme  interest  rate  volatility  is nothing  but  the 
volatility  of the  currency  being  translated  in interest  rate  terms. 

Spot  is not  necessarily  what  is visible  on  the  screen.  Spot  for  delivery  in 
a  week  is  a  sum  of spot  +  forward  “points,”  themselves  function  of the  in- 
terest  rate  differential.  The  trader  buys  or  sells  spot  and  then  buys  or  sell 
the  forward  points.  There  is  no  real  market  for  nonsynthetic  forward  out- 
right.  The  method  of calculation  is as  follows: 

C=  Eatin! 

S is the  spot,  F the  forward. 

If  one  freezes  S,  F  will  continue  trading.  For  S  ta  remain  constant, 
(r2  —  r1)  will  adjust.  Generally,  it  is  the  currency’s  interest  rate,  here  r2 
that  will  take  the  brunt  of the  adjustment.*  - 

“ 

The  impact  on  an  option’s  position  is  that  a  European  option,  or  one 
that  is not  for  cash  delivery,  will  trade  off  the  forward,  totally  unconcerned 
with  spot.  Notice  that  99%  of vanilla  currency  options  are  European.  Such 
an  option  will  go  through  the  barrier  like  a  knife  in  warm  butter.  Its  price 
will  adjust  to  the  final  F. In  pricing  these  instruments,  it is therefore  neces- 
sary  to  eliminate  the  idea  of a  barrier. 

Risk  Management  Rule:  A  currency  band,  even  when  fully  en- 
forced,  does  not  represent  a  flawless  barrier  for  a European  option 
unless  interest  rates  for  both  elements  of  the  pair  are  banded  as 
well. 

WHat  FLAT  MEANS 

(A flat position  is a  position  that  does  not  present  any  market  risk,/For  cash 
and  short-term  products,  a  flat  position  is  a matched  position.  A derivatives

Option  Wizard:  An  EMS  War  Story 

A trader  who  survived  the  EMS  (European  Monetary  System)  breakup  of  1992 
recounts  the  following.  In  the  events  leading  up  to  the  turmoil  of  September 
1992,  he  had  to  execute  a  large  option  order  in  sterling  versus  German  marks 
for  a  customer.  He  needed  to  buy  quantities  of out-of-the-money  puts  on  the 
sterling,  calls  on  the  mark,  struck  10%  outside  the  official  government  band. 
The  customer  was  a  conspiracy  theorist  fund  manager  who  believed  in  the  im- 
minent  breakup  of  the  monetary  order.  He  belonged  to  the  small  coterie  of 
traders  who  took  on  the  Bank  of England  later  that  month. 

The  trader,  being  risk  averse,  decided  to  do  what  most  of his  headache-free 

peers  do:  call  a  large  market  maker,  add  on  a  margin,  and  earn  the  difference. 
He  called  two  of the  largest  option  dealers  in  the  world  asking  for  their  selling 
price  and  received  the  following  answers: 

1.  W.,  based  in  the  United  States,  and  a  former  CME  pit trader,  told  him  that 
they  were  reluctant  to  show  a  price  “because  the  strike  is outside  the  band” 
and  the  options  were  “too  risky.”  They  would  accommodate  him  if necessary, 
but  at  very  expensive  implied  volatility  and  only  for  a moderate  amount. 

2.  B.,  based  in  Europe,  literally  laughed  at  him.  “But  Zey  are  outside  the  band, 
if  | am  not  mistaken,”  he  was  told.  “How  many  do  you  vant?  | can  sell  you 
all  you  need.  You  should  give  your  money  to  charity  instead.” 

W.  was  a  former  pit  trader  surrounded  by former  pit  traders.  He  is  now 
the  head  of  worldwide  foreign  exchange  for  a  large  bank.  The  second  dealer, 
B.,  was  a  graduate  of a  prestigious  European  school  of engineering.  He  is now 
back  to  engineering  and  other  precise  activities  after  his  desk  was  decimated 
by disastrous  losses  in  September  1992.  After  all,  in  the  physical  world,  barri- 
ers  are  barriers,  bridges  are  bridges,  and  horses  are  horses. 

third  derivative  of  the  security  price  to  spot,  usually  the  indicator  of  the 
risk  reversal,  commonly  called  DdeltaDspot,  and  so  oD 

The  need  to  understand  the  relativity  of  the  flatconcept  needs  to  be 
stressed  for  noninitiated  managers  of  derivatives  traders,  or  users  of  the 
product  who,  unable  to  exactly  offset  a  position  for  lack  of  liquidity,  start 
running  trades  to  reduce  the  risk.  Running  trades  against  a  book  to  offset  a 
Greek  (i.e.,  a  first-order  or  second-order  partial  derivative)  causes  complica- 
tions  for  the  non-market  maker. 

Path-dependent  and  barrier  options  are  never  flat  with  respect  to  par- 
tial  derivatives  for  long.  The  pin  risk  for  barriers  makes  them  only  hedge- 
able  dynamically.  Binary  options  are  never  flat.

This  chapter  will  cover  common  methods  of risk  management  as  used  by in- 
stitutions.  They  tie  in  with  some  of the  analyses  discussed  in Chapter  9 on 
vega.  These  should  be  mandatory  reading  for  persons  who  understand  op- 
tions  but  have  never  examined  the  risks  of a  book  taken  as  a  whole.

Bucketing 
with  respect  to  a  particular  parameter  in time  intervals.  Operators  thus 
obtain  the  delta  buckets,  vega  buckets,  gamma  buckets,  and  so  on. 

It is a  static  risk  management  method  because  the  markets  are  assumed  to 
be  constant.  No  convexity  truly  shows;  Vega  and  rho,  for  example,  can  vary 
in some  combination  of instruments  with  the  asset  level  or,  sometimes,  may 
increase  or  decrease  as  the  parameter  changes.  The  effect  is assumed  to  be 
beastly  with  compound,  barrier,  and  other  exotic  options. 

It can  already  be  detected  that  the  bucketing  does  not  show  higher  mo-

Measuring  Option  Risks 

The  trader  buys  a  6-month  call  (183  days)  in  the  amount  of  GBP 
100  mil.  The  price  is  4.578%  and  the  trader  pays  $4,578,000  for  it.  Its 
hedge  is 50  deltas.  The  following  parameters  hold: 

183-day  USD  rate  5.8438%  (basis  360  days) 

GBP  rate  6.915%  (basis  360  days) 

The  forward  =  Spot  x 

[1 +  (183/360  x  .058438)] 
[1 +  (183/360  x  .06915)] 

=  1.5973 

Table  14.1  shows  deltas,  gammas,  vegas,  Rhol,  and  Rho2  (all  in  WSD), 
All  measures  are  unweighted.  The  bucketing  is  called  “straight”  because 
the  exposure  in  the  6-month  corresponds  to  an  exposure  starting  at  time  0 
and  ending  in 6 months.  It is easy  to see  that  the  delta  as  shown  in Table  14.1 
corresponds  to  the  present  value  of the  forward  delta.  Thus  the  spot  delta  is 
equal  (in 000)  to  (82656)  / [1 +  (1.83/360  x  .06915)]  =  (79850). 

All  the  other  elements  are  straightforward. 
The  gamma  of GBP  8,355,000  means  that  the  position  should  increase  by 
such  amount  should  the  market  rally  1%  and  decrease  likewise  in a sell-off. 
This  is  an  approximation:  The  position  will  not  actually  pick  up  such  an 
amount  in  a  rally  owing  to  the  third  derivative  (it  is  now  at  maximum 
gamma  being  at-the-money). 

The  vega  is straightforward:  $438,000  for  a  rise,of  1 volatility  percentage 

point. 

(The rho  domestic  corresponds  to  the  sensitivity  of  the  option  to  a 
change  of 100 basis  points  inthe  U.S.  rates.  The  Rho2  foreign  corresponds  to 
the  same  with  the  foreign  rate.)\However,  the  Rhol  is lower  because  it also is 
sensitive  to  the  discounting-of  the  premium  the  other  way.  The  methods  for 
calculating  rhol  and  rho2  are  as  follows: 

¢  Foreign  Rho2. 

The  procedure  to  obtain  rho2  is to  multiply  the  delta 
by the  rate  and  interpolate  for  183  days.  It is (183/360)  *  82656  x  100 
bp =  $420,168.  The  present  value  of that  using  the  U.S.  rate  is 408,000 
(assuming  no  convexity). 

¢  Domestic  Rho1. 

It is the  same  number  minus  the  exposure  to  the  fi- 
nancing  of the  premium.  The  premium  was  $4.57M.  The  effect  of the

rise  of the  U.S.  rates  would  be to  cost  him  more  in the  daily  financing 
of his  premium,  by 4.57  x  183/360  =  $23,200.  Roughly,  the  net  Rhol 
is 408,000  —  23,200  =  384,800. 

Note:  The  effect  of convexity  over  this  position  would  be  to  lower  the  nega- 
tive  P/L  stemming  from a rise  in foreign  rates  and  increase  the  positive  P/L 
stemming  from  a  drop,  and  vice  versa  for  domestic  rates. 

American  and  Path-Dependent  Options 

ke 

The  bucketing  method  works  in  general  better  for  European  options  be- 
cause  the  buckets  are  only  partially  unstable.  They  could  be  increased  or 
decreased  (through  the  gain  or  loss  of  gamma  or  vega  when  the  option 
moves  in  on  out  of the  money),  but  it is not  possible  for  the  exposure  of one 
particular  option  to  change  buckets. 

With  American  and  path-dependent  options,  the  exact  duration  of  the 
exposure  is  uncertain.  This  makes  the  bucketing  method  often  inappropri- 
ate.  A  barrier  that  increases  in  probability  of  becoming  extinguished  will 
move  in vega,  gamma,  and  Greeks  closer  to  the  short-term  buckets.  Likewise 
when  the  market  moves  away  from  the  strike,  American  and  path-dependent 
options  start  resembling  a  European  option  and  would  have  an  exposure 
closer  to  the  nominal  maturity. 

Volatility  shifts  would  also  exert  the  same  effect  on  the  barrier  matu- 
rity.  A higher  volatility  shortens  the  duration  of a barrier  knock-out  option. 

sacle ic aoa ales the Enc esau ae nos OF eT STT CT SHAKE options  are 
impossible  to  fit  in  a  straight  bucket  because  their  exposure  starts  at  one 
point  and  ends  at  another,  therefore  making  them  dependent  on  a  forward- 
forward  bucket.  They  depend  more  on  events  that  take  place  during  some 
time  segments  than  in  others.  Worse,  some  structures  (like  barriers)  are 
calendar  spreads  in  disguise.  The  trader  can  be  seriously  misled  by the  net 
bucket  exposure  disclosed  by the  straight  system. 

The  only  way  to  see  the  risks  of  these  instruments  is  to  engage  in  dy- 
namic  bucketing,  which  requires  the  trader  to  review  the  position  at  various 
states  of the  underlying  at  volatilities  and  try to  match  the  risks  accordingly. 

Advanced  Topic:  The  Forward  or  “Forward-Forward”  Bucket 

Although  rarely  implemented,  owing  to  the  computational  complications, 
the  need  to  see  a  forward-forward  option  risk  appears  to  be  essential  with 
path-dependent  options,  options  on  products  such  as  knock-in  options,  and 
non-time-homogeneous  structures  such  as  variable  bets.  The  building  of such 
a  bucketing  system  obsessed  the  author  for  a  long time,  until  the  most  recent 
accretions  in numerical  techniques.

The  forward-forward  bucketing  would  appear  as  shown  in Table  14.2. 
The  computer’s  method  for  filling  the  cells  is  quite  complicated  when 
the  portfolio  includes  path-dependent  options.  As  there  are  no  analytical 
methods  for  that,  it needs  to  move  the  cells  in  such  a  way  as  to  leave  the  pa- 
rameters  affecting  the  other  parts  constant. 

The  forward-forward  bucketing  needs  to be constructed  by breaking  up 
the  exposures  in  distinct  volatility  periods  and  running  the  following  sim- 
ulation  on  the  total  position: 

¢  Volatility  is raised  for  one  particular  bucket  but  not  others.  The  bino- 
mial  tree  is run  with  the  new  higher  volatility  between  the  nodes  for 
that  period  but  is maintained  constant  for  other  periods.  The  differ- 
ence  in price  stemming  from  that  would  be  the  vega. 

¢ 

If  the  portfolio  consisted  only  of  European  options,  it  could  be  as- 
sumed  that  the  volatility  does  not  depend  on  the  location  of  the 
shock  but  on  the  general  effect  over  the  entire  portfolio.  Every bucket 
would  therefore  share  an  equal  portion  of the  total  gamma. 

¢  The  vega  and  the  gamma  will  be bucket  dependent  for non-European 

instruments. 

This  method  is reviewed  extensively  in Chapter  9. 

TOPOGRAPHY 

@  Position  Topography  for  an  options  book  is a  risk  management  method 
that  displays  the  distribution  of  the  exposures  of  the  portfolio  across 
time  and  possible  asset  prices. 

e  There  are  two  kind  of topography  reports:  strike  (or static)  topogra- 

phy and  gamma  (or dynamic)  topography. 

e  Topography  has  considerable  advantages  as  it allows  for  transcend- 

ing the  Greeks  as  shown  in Table  14.3.

Strike  Topography  (or  Static  Topography) 

@  Static  Topography  is a  two-dimensional  map  of the  position  displaying 
the  distribution  of the  exposure  in  face  value  horizontally  (across  expi- 
rations)  and  vertically  (across  strikes). 

When  option  trading  was  still  at  a  primitive  state  and  option  traders  were 
dealing  with  only  one  or,  at  the  most,  two  expirations,  they  used  to  main- 
tain  their  open  positions  on  a  card  provided  by the  clearing  house  so  they 
could  rapidly  see  what  they  had  in  their  inventory.  The  clearing  houses 
handed  out  the  cards  without  charge.  Table  14.3  depicts  a  sample  card. 

The  trader  could  thus  examine  the  position  beyond  the  deltas  and  gam- 
mas  and  trade  his  position  instead  of trading  his  Greeks.  Such  a  method,  in- 
deed,  has  an  admirable  tutorial  value  as  it  forces  the  trader  to  learn  the 
intricacies  of option  trading  without  having  recourse  to  pseudo-mathemat- 
ical  methods  like  the  Greek  reports.  Instead  of waking  up  at night with  cold 
sweats  and  shouting  the  abstract,  “I do  not  enjoy  my  being  short  22.23  gam- 
mas  and  71  weighted  vegas,”  the  trader  would  phrase  his  worries  about  the 
position  in more  precise  terms  such  as,  “I am  short  so  many  of the  105  calls 
that  I need  serious  protection.” 

Modern  book  runners,  however,  do  not  have  such  luxury.  As  there  are 
no  set  expiration  dates  and  no  set  strikes,  the  card  in Table  14.2  would  need 
a  few  thousand  lines  and  columns  to  reflect  the  topography  of a  large  over- 
the-counter  portfolio.  In addition,  it does  not  allow  for  any  option  structure 
beyond  the  vanilla. 

234 

Measuring  Option  Risks 

So  over-the-counter  books  need  a  design  that  allows  traders  to  bundle 
the  exposures  in  time  and  space  points  and  examine  their  concentration 
risks.  The  strike  topography  is generally  designed  as  shown  in Table  14.4. 

The  over-the-counter  strike  topography  displays  the  face  value  exposure 
per  bidimensional  bucket.  The  report  shows  horizontally  (strike-wise)  the 
net  of  the  face  value  exposures  between  midpoints  on  the  grid  and  verti- 
cally  (time  periods)  the  net  of  face  value  between  points.  So  the  1W/100 
bucket  displays  the  net  of all  the  trades  between  two  days  and  one  week  and 
every  option  struck  between  99  and  101. 

The  strike  topography  should  deliberately  exclude  most  nonvanilla  op- 
tions,  which  can  be  remedied  in  a  separate  report.  American  options,  in  ad- 
dition  should  be  handled  with  care,  because  their  nominal  expiration  is not 
exactly  the  expected  one.  Only  soft  American  instruments  should  be  in- 
cluded  on  the  matrix.  A more  thorough  treatment  of American  options  cor- 
responds  to  shifting  their  nominal  maturity  into  the  “omega”  or  real  time 
to  expiration. 

An  application  of the  topography  method  is  the  method  of squares,  ex- 

plained  in Chapter  9. 

Adding  Correlated  Instruments. 
It is possible  to  incorporate  more  than 
one  similar  commodity  by summing  them  up,  that  is  assuming  100%  cor- 
relation.  Such  a  method  aims  only at examining  the  strike  concentration  or 
the  origin  of gammas  and  vegas  and  can  thus  simplify  without  deluding 
the  trader  about  his  position.  For  example,  if one  thinks  that  it would  be 
necessary  to  examine  the  risks  of the  French  franc  and  the  German  mark 
in  one  report  for  topography  purposes  only,  then  all  the  USD-FRF  strikes 
would  be  converted  into  USD-DEM.  The  real  improvement,  however,

would  come  from  the  hardly  practicable  three-dimensional  map  that  al- 
lows  for  the  slopes  of the  correlation. 

Scaled  Strike  Topography. 
Since  the  difference  between  strikes  that  are 
close  to  the  money  is more  meaningful  for short-term  options  than  for back- 
month  structures,  it is necessary  to  scale.  For  all  intents  and  purposes  the 
“gap”  between  the  100  and  the  101  strikes  is insignificant  for  a 5-year  option 
and  very  annoying  for  an  overnight  structure,  The  method  as  shown  in 
Table  14.5  used  to  account  for  the  risk  difference  is the  scaling  method  that, 
in place  of strikes,  examines  standard  deviations.  At  15.7  volatility,  a  1 stan- 
dard  deviation  difference  between  strikes  is 1 percentage  point,  that  is, be- 
tween  100  and  101.  In  one  year,  it  is  the  square  root  of  252  (252  days  of 
business),  namely  15.7.  So  the  equivalent  to  an  overnight  gap  of  1 point  is 
the  one-year  gap  of 15.7  points.  Hence,  assuming  the  spot traded  at  100  (and 
no  drift),  the  report  would  put in  the  same  column  the  101  overnight  strike 
and  the  115.7  one-year  strike. 

Dynamic  Topography  (Local  Volatility  Exposure) 

Dynamic  topography  is a  potent  method  of analysis  as  it can  reveal  the  sta- 
bility  of a position  through  time.  It consists  in keeping  the  position  constant 
and  running  simulation  one  day  ahead,  two  days  ahead,  one  week  ahead, 
and  so  on,  and  disclosing  the  map  of the  resulting  Greeks. 

The  needs  for  the  dynamic  topography  are  accentuated  in  an  environ- 
ment  where  the  positions  change  rapidly  and  frequently.  A  conventional 
gamma  or  vega  matrix  can  obscure  the  real  position  if strong  changes  take 
place  through  time.  For  example,  if the  position  is  long  one-week  options 
and  short  two-week  options  in  large  quantities,  the  position  report  would 
mask  the  real  issues,  which  is  the  risk  one  week  from  today  for  one  entire 
week. 

The  report  is not  concerned  with  the  deltas  but 
Computation  Technique. 
simply  with  the  gammas.  The  operator  starts  by running  today’s  gammas 
for  different  asset  price  levels.  Then  he would  block  the  options  expiring  on 
the  following  day and  run  the  gammas  one  day hence  for  all  of these  levels, 
and  so  on.  Moving  the  calendar  one  day  hence  means  running  the  global 
position  as  if the  calendar  date  was  one  day forward.

Measuring  Option  Risks 

The  following  report  would  not  perform  very  well  for  exotic  options 
since  their  path  dependency  makes  every  report  conditional.  In  other 
words,  the  exposure  on  a  100  call  103  knock-out  depends  on  whether  or  not 
the  market  traded  through  103  the  previous  day. 

The  map  shown  in  Table  14.6  would  result.  It may  appear  similar  to  the 
previous  ones  but  is  truly  a  different  animal,  as  it eliminates  the  positions 
that  expire  as  time  goes  by. 

The  preceding  topography  technique  could  be  further  improved  with 
the  use  of  correlations.  The  operator  would  need  to  run  the  reports  using 
the  possible  changes  through  time  of the  correlations  between  markets. 

There  is no  known  way  to  derive  from  the  dynamic  topog- 
Shortcomings. 
raphy  the  exposures  to  path-dependent  options.  A  trader  might  look  at  the 
gamma  of  the  book  should  the  market  reach  102  in  one  month.  Whatever 
number  he  looked  at  would  not  be  accurate  if the  position  included  knock- 
out  options.  Say that  he  had  a  structure  that  knocked  out  at  104.5.  Because 
the  market  ended  at  102  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  it  did  not  transit 
through  104.5,  in  which  case  the  gamma  exposure  would  be  markedly  dif- 
ferent.  The  same  applies  to  a  lookback:  A pulldown  from a high level  would 
result  in  a  lower  gamma  than a situation  where  the  market  trades  at  its  ex- 
tremum  (its maximum  or  minimum). 

The  complications  of  path  dependence are that  many  more  possible 
paths  are  available  than  end  points  and  there  is  no  rapid  way  to  visualize 
the  position  taking  those  into  account.

show  far  in  advance.  Moreover,  no  true  expiration  date  is  attached  to  the 
pin,  which  makes  the  expected  stopping  time  a  fuzzy  function  of volatility, 
rates,  and  so  on. 

There  is,  however,  the  need  to  see  the  worst-case  scenario.  This  disclo- 
sure  is  greatly  simplified  because  the  worst  possible  case  for  a  barrier  lies 
on  the  strike  at  expiration.  So  it would  suffice  to  establish  the  map  of  the 
“nominal  maturity  of the payoffs  to  prevent  the  trader  from  adding  to  a  neg- 
ative  “zone.”  Figure  14.1  shows  such  a  map.

™  Take  one  maturity  and  measure  the  implied  volatility  differential  be- 
tween  the  at-the-money  options  and  the  out-of-the-money  “wings” 
priced  off  the  Black-Scholes  model.  The  tails  will  represent  the  general 
pricing  of the  wings  while  the  implied  skew  will  measure  the  degree  of 
asymmetry  of the  distribution. 

This  notion  has  already  been  discussed  relative  to  the  volatility  surface. 
This  chapter  focuses  on  the  reasons  for  the existence  of  the  tails  and  the

the  “volatility  of  volatility,”  or  vvol.JIt  is  related  to  the  fourth  moment,  or

In  the  old  days,  however,  traders  used  to  disbelieve  the  phenomenon  and

attribute  the  inflated  prices  of out-of-the-money  options  to  the  “lottery  ef- 
fect,”  which  meant  that  investors  were  ready  to  spend  small  sums  to  get  a 
large payoff  and  that  such  attraction  of the  large payoff would  blind  them  to 
real  value.  The  lottery  effect,  in the  long run,  seemed  to have  favored  the  in- 
vestors  owing  to  the  convexity  for  which  they paid  so  little. 

The  following  simple  explanation  of  option  pricing  uses  an  adaptation 
of the  Black-Scholes-Merton  formula  for  a  variable  volatility  inspired  from 
the  Hull  and  White  model.” 

Assume  that  volatility  follows  a  process  like  that  of  the  asset  itself, 
without  any  drift.  This  is  a simplifying  method  aimed  at assessing  the  dam- 
age  from  variable  volatility  rather  than  hoping  to  model  volatility  itself. 
Most  techniques  of volatility  modeling  have,  at  the  time  of  writing,  led  to 
if any  convincing  results.  The  model  is further  explained  in Module  G. 
little 
Table  15.1  shows  the  impact  of  actual  volatility  swings  on  a  90-day  at- 
the-money  option  priced  at  15.7%  volatility.  Three  cases  are  considered. 
Case  1,  with  vvol  =  0.25,  means  that  volatility  changes  on  average  about 
0.16  per  day (i.e., between  15.7  and  15.86),  randomly,  just like  the  asset  itself. 
Case  2,  with  vvol  =  0.5,  means  that  volatility  changes  twice  as  much. 
Vvol  =  0  corresponds  to  the  conventional  Black-Scholes  case,  in  which 
volatility  remains  constant  and  the  entire  sample  is  drawn  from  the  same 
volatility  of 15.7%. 

(Each case  leads  to  different  option  prices It is  easily  seen  that  an at-the- 
money  option  is  entirely  unaffected  by volatility 
shifts,  and  that  gut- -of-the-

Piet co Ges mse  sagas the  conventional  method  of practition- 
ers,  which  shifts  from  a  particular  price  to  the  implied  volatility  equivalent. 
The  trader  can  thus  confirm  that  the  Black-Scholes  values  are  identical  to  the 
vvol  =  0 case. 

The  stochastic  volatility  model  used  for  Figure  15.1  gives  the  results  of 
fat  tails  in  proportion  to  the  volatility  of  volatility.  Since  the  volatility  of 
volatility  is  not  known  and  can  hardly  be  estimated,  the  reader  should  re- 
tain  from  the  exercise  a  set  of rules  rather  than  a  modeling  framework. 

The  results  show  an  increase  in  values  where  there  is  convexity  to 
volatility  (i.e.,  away  from  the  money).  At-the-money  options  imperceptibly 
lose  in  volatility  owing  to  their  minuscule  concavity  (a call  is capped  at  the 
price  of the  asset).

could  explain  the  skew.  A positive  correlation  between  them  would  lead  to 
positive  skew. 

It is difficult  to  establish  a dependence  between  asset  price 
Warning: 
and  volatility.  To  show  the  behavior  of asset  prices  in  a  skewed  envi- 
ronment  this  exercise  should  be appropriately  altered  for  the  following 
reasons: 

J Asset returns and volatility  may  be  correlated,  but  in  a  nonlinear 
way.  Typically,  the  correlation  holds  from  small  moves  but  may  re- 
verse  for  a  large  one.  A clear  example  is the  SP500  futures:  Volatility 
drops  after  a  small  rally but  increases  after  a  large  one. 

2.  It is clear  to  traders  who  have  studied  data  that(the volatility,  if any- 
thing,  is  correlated  (or,  more  appropriately,  associated)  to  the  range  in 
asset  prices,  not  the  asset  price  or  its  variation.  It is not  surprising  to 
see  that  the  behavior  is  marked  by “thresholds.”  The  market  drops 
would  not  increase  volatility  if  they  were  to  take  place  within  the 
confines  of  a known  range,  particularly  after  a  rally) Such  a  relation- 
ship  is not  easy  to  model  (in spite  of all  the  ARCH-style  attempts). 

A frequent  question  is, Why  does  a  variable  volatility  cause  fat  tails?° 

e  The  primary  explanation  is  that  of  likelihood  of  asset  prices  condi- 
tional  on  states  of volatility.  Assume  random  volatility  and  random 
asset  prices.  It is easy  to  understand  that,  conditional  on  being  in the 
tails,  the  most  likely  state  is one  of high volatility.  High  volatility  can 
more  easily  take  the market  to  the  tails  than  a  lower  one.  Thus the” 
tails  will  have  the  thickness  of the higher  volatility. 

————— 

242 

Measuring  Option  Risks 

°  (The lower  volatility  is more  likely  to  keep  the  market  in  the  middle, 
the  “peak.” Thus the  distribution,  when  in  the middle  (1.e.,  no  mean- 
ingful  changes  in  the  market  prices),  is  more  likely  to  take  the  shape 
of a  lower  volatility. 

The  concept  is even  easier  to  understand  graphically.  Figure  15.2  shows  two 
distributions,  one  of  which  has  four  times  the  volatility  of  the  other.  The_ 
higher  volatility  distribution  has  fatter  tails  than  the lower  one.  The lower 
volatility  distribution  has  a  higher  peak  than  the  higher  one.  It becomes  con- 
ceivable tha  in mixing  the  two  distributions,  the  higher  volatility  would 
dominate  the  tails,  the  lower  one  would  dominate  the  body.

Histograms  from  the  Markets 

m@  A histogram  shows  the  relative  frequency  of a  certain  magnitude  of the 
returns  (or more  frequently  the  logarithms  of the  price  changes)  during 
a  certain  time  interval.  Typically,  a histogram  shows  daily changes.  Fre- 
quency  is obtained  by bucketing  the  moves  and  counting  the  percentage 
(or total  number)  of occurrences  in every  bucket. 

Figures  15.3  through  15.6  show  the  actual  distribution  of the  following  as- 
sets:  the  Japanese  yen,  SP500  and  the  30-year  U.S:  government  bond  yields, 
and  the  Euromark  futures.  The  first  three  cover  10  years  and  the  last  one  3 
years.  They  show  the  histograms  of the  frequency  of the  differences  of logs 
of  prices  (the  returns)  plotted  against  a  normal  distribution  of  the  same 
overall  volatility.  All  of the  figures  display  the  high peak  syndrome. 

The  astute  reader  might  observe  “high  peaks”  in  place  of “fat  tails.”  In 
fact,  traders  betting  against  the  fat  tails  typically  make  bets  against  the 
peak:  They  try  to  make  some  profits  when  nothing  happens  rather  than 
during  extreme  moves.

Example.  A  Tailor-Made  fat-Tailed  Distribution: 
For  amusement  (ona 
summer  day that  qualifies  as  “high  peak”),  the  author  conceived  the  fol- 
lowing  distribution:  three  regimes  in the  market,  each  one  of which  car- 
ries  a  different  volatility.  The  regimes  are  as  follows: 

sl:  Volatility  is 15%  (normal  market  conditions). 

s2:  Volatility  is 5%  (holiday  mood  and  summer  slumber). 

s3:  Volatility  is 20%  (anxiety). 

Each  regime  is equally  probable. 

The  Monte  Carlo  simulator,  sampling  between  them,  produced  the 
histogram  shown  in  Figure  15.7. 

THE  SKEW  AND  BIASED  ASSETS 

The  skew  is  the  assymetry  in  the  distribution.  Take  a  daily  move 
Log(S,/S,_  ,), with  o” its noncentered  volatility  (assuming  mean  re- 
x, = 
turn  of 0 as  explained  in Chapter  6). The  (noncentered)  skew  will  be: 

Re 
ie 
t=1 

3 ie 
Uy o 

which  will  be positive  if there  is a  positive  correlation  between  x, and  x,* 
and  negative  if there  is  a  negative  correlation.  Intuitively  the  skew  ex- 
presses  the  correlation  between  the  move  of  a  random  variable  (x,) and 
its  volatility  (x,’).

Option  Wizard:  Graphical  Representation  of Pareto-Levy* 

Many  traders  hear  about  the  Pareto-Levy  family  of stable  distributions.  This  is 
a  broad  class  of distributions  said  to  be  “stable”  because  they  can  be  shifted. 
The  trader  needs  to  know  no  further  than  that  the  bell-shaped  distribution  is 
but  one  particular  case  of this  large  and  unhappy  family.  A description  follows. 

The  characteristic  function  of the  Pareto-Levy  distribution: 

Log  f(t)  =  (8t,—  yltl*  (1+  iB(t/Itl)  tan(an/2)) 

where  i is  the  imaginary  number 
V—1  .  When  a@  =  2,  it  becomes  the  Fourier 
transform  of the  normal  distribution  (with  also  B =  0, y  =  1,8  =  1),  exp  ( —f). 
The  function  has  no  second  moment  (that  is  no  variance)  when  a  <  2 and 
no  first  moment  (that  is  no  mean)  for  a  <  1.  It means  that  the  function  has  an 
infinite  variance,  an  implication  that  is  scary  for  anyone  involved  in  the  mar- 
kets.  Physically,  the  left  and  right  tail  never  come  close  to  the  origin.  No  more 
compact  support. 

As  shown  in  the  following  chart,  the  inverse  characteristic  function  (i.e., 
the  density  function  stemming  from  it)  would  have  the  following  shape:  As  a 
goes  down  from  2  toward  0,  the  tails  get  thicker  and  the  convergence  of  the 
density  toward  the  zero  probability  mark  gets  slower.  As  a  gets  smaller,  a 
wider  and  wider  graph  is  needed  to  show  the  distribution.  That  illustrates  the 
notion  of infinite  volatility:  It is impossible  to  fit  the  grapl¥  into  the  confines  of 
a  visual  frame.* 

Probability 
Density 
(different 
scales) 

Returns 

Even  scarier:  When  the  distribution  has  no  mean,  no  peak  is  visible,  but 

lines  go  up  to  the  ceiling  without  ever  meeting. 

Many  chaos  theorists  have  complained  of  the  misuse  of  the  Pareto-Levy 

class  of distributions  in  the  common  down-market  literature. 

It  is  easier  for  traders  to  think  of  fat  tails  as  a  result  of  changing  volatility 
than  the  product  of some  blowing-out  variance.  In fact,  Pareto-Levy  is the  fruit 
of very  high  volatility  of volatility  on  a  very  small  volatility.

Figure  15.8 

A  highly  skewed  distribution. 

Figures  15.8  and  15.9  show  two  different  degrees  of skewness  in the  dis- 
tribution.  The  skew  is  not  easy  to  translate  into  skewed  volatility  surface. 
The  linear  skew  measure  presented  above  is too  weak a statistic  to  properly 
explain  the  true  dependence  between  volatility  and  asset  prices.  There  are 
many  cases  where  a  dynamic  hedger  would  make  money  owning  expensive 
puts  and  shorting  cheap  calls  in  spite  of a  close  to  symmetric  histogram. 

A  histogram  does  not  show  the  path.  Suppose  that  the  Syldavian  cur- 
rency  initially  goes  up  and  down  symmetrically  by  1%.  As  it  goes  down, 
however,  three  days  in a  row  the  volatility  increases.  Such  increase  in volatil- 
ity is likely  to push it down  further  but  can  as  well  bring  it back  to  the  origin. 
The  histogram  would  look  almost  balanced.  In  reality,  it  would  show  a 
slightly  bulging  left  tail, but nothing  serious  enough  to be detected.  What  the 
histogram  shows  well  is  the  classical  scenario  of  a  market  that  only  goes 
down  by, say,  $4  (with  20%  probability)  and  goes  up  by $1  (with  80%  proba- 
bility).  It  does  not  very  well  show  the  correlation  between  asset  price  and 
volatility,  only the  correlation  between  asset  changes  and  volatility  changes.

Risk  Management  Rule: 
show  the  dependence  between  price  level  and  market  volatility. 

The  histogram  does  not  appropriately 

How  this  dependence  is to be translated  into  the  distribution  of implied 
volatility  between  strike  prices  is uncertain.  The  customary  method  has 
been  to  look  at the  final  histogram,  derive  a probability  distribution  and  try 
to  compare  it with  that  implied  by option  prices.  The  trader  can  generate  a 
density  from  an  option  price  by taking  the  second  derivative  of the  option 
with  respect  to  the  strike  price.  (See  Breeden  and  Liechtenberger,  1978.)  As 
a  trader,  the  author  is  extremely  suspicious  of  this  technique  as  it ignores 
the  path  dependency  that  arises  from  changes  in  volatility.  As  explained 
with  the  greater  fool  theory  (Chapter  3), the  behavior  of implied  volatility  is 
a  determining  factor  in option  trading.  Out-of-the-money  puts  therefore  be- 
come  great  assets  not  only  because  the  market  might  drop  violently,  but 
mostly because  the behavior  of the  market  at lower  levels  might benefit  their 
owner.  This  leads  to  the  following  rule:

Path  Dependence.  The  value  of the  skew 
Risk Management  Rule: 
for  a  dynamic  hedger  resides  more  in  the  behavior  of  implied 
volatility  along  the  path  leading  to  a  terminal  value  than  in  the 
probability  of the  asset  ending  up  on  such  terminal  value. 

Biased  Assets 

The  old  trader’s  adage,  “Up  the  escalator,  down  the  chute,”  seems  to  describe 
the  behavior  of a  variety  of assets. 

Biased assets  are  assets  with  an  asymmetrical  distribution,  character- 
ized  with  an  increased  volatility  in  the  sell-off  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  a 
diminished  volatility  in the  rally. 

The  structure  of their  market  is such  that a sell-off  causes  anxiety  while  ral- 
lies  cause  euphoria.  Such  anxiety  would  cause  severe  volatility  on  the  way 
down  while  euphoria  generally  leads  to  orderly  markets  on  the  way  up.  An 
example  that  easily  comes  to  mind  is the  Mexican  currency.  Table  15.2  pre- 
sents  a  simplified  world  composed  of two  poles  of extreme  regimes  for  bi- 
ased  assets.  There  are  naturally  shades  in  between  as  well  as  transitional 
periods  between  states. 

There  are  many  explanations  for  biased  assets,  some  of  which  will  be 

described  in the  following  sections.

Nonparallel  Accounting 

That  some  assets  have  owners  but  no  one  is consciously  short  them  is one  of 
the  miracles  of modern  finance.  In  other  words,  there  is an  accounting  dis- 
crepancy  between  the  owner  who  is subjected  to  some  rules  and  the  seller 
who  does  not  have  any  marks  to  market. 

Bonds  issued  by the  government  of  Italy  are  marked  to  market  by the 
owners  who  show  a  measure  of happiness  when  the  prices  go  up  (i.e.,  yield 
comes  down).  Paradoxically,  the  government  of Italy  too  will  exhibit  happi- 
ness  when  the  prices  go  up  because  their  financing  costs  in  the  future  will 
be lower.  While  the  owner’s  wealth  increased  in the  move,  that  of the  Italian 
Republic  did  not  decrease.  If  the  government  of  Italy  had  a  P/L  showing 
that  they  issued  bonds  at  100,  now  trading  at  105,  and  that  they  would  lose 
a few  trillion  lires  should  they buy back  their  issues,  the  matter  would  be al- 
together  different.

Measuring  Option  Risks 

Stocks  are  issued  by corporations.  At  the  end  of a  day when  the  stocks 
are  up,  the  wealth  of  the  country  increases  by the  jump  in  capitalization. 
Wealth  was  created  out  of nothing.  But  corporations  who  issued  the  stocks 
should  not  begrudge  the  value  created  at  their  expense:  The  owners  can 
issue  even  more  stock,  manager’s  stock  options  have  improved,  employees 
now  are  richer  in  their  retirement  plan,  and  so  on.  This  is  a  miracle  where 
barring  a  few  exceptions,  just about  every  person  in the  world  benefits  from 
a  rally.  The  unhappy  minority  is  composed  of  (1)  those  who  do  not  own 
stocks  and  see  their  neighbor  driving  away  in  a  new  car  (they  could  be  con- 
sidered  the  true  shorts)—only  rarely  do  these  become  the  majority;  (2) the 
uncovered  short,  the  commodity  traders,  the  hedge  funds  hoping  to  make  a 
killing  in the  next  market  crash. 

Value  Linked  to  Price 

A  stock  price  that  goes  up  often  brings  stability  to  the  company  because  it 
can  now  have  access  to  easier  financing.  When  the  market  value  of a  com- 
pany  goes  up,  the  debt-to-equity  ratio  improves  from  both  an  accounting 
and  economic  standpoint.’  From  an  accounting  point  of view,  the  company 
can  raise  cash  and  retire  debt  thus  increasing  the  left-hand  side  of the  bal- 
ance  sheet.  From  an  economic  one,  the  total  capitalization  increases.  Such 
increase  can  lead  to  a  better  credit  rating  and  ensure  a  wider  (and  cheaper) 
ability  to  borrow.  Likewise  a  drop  in  price  makes  it riskier,  therefore  more 
volatile.  The  same  applies  to  governments.  When  an  emerging  country  has 
higher  asset  prices,  the  government  can  easily  fulfill  its  debt  obligations  by 
issuing  debt.  But  when  the  asset  prices  are  trashed,  governments  might  find 
it  increasingly  difficult  to  borrow,  thus  precipitating  a  vicious  cycle  and 
creating  more  uncertainty. 

Currencies  as  Assets 

Veteran  option  traders  can  easily  detect  if the  currency  pair is biased.  Typi- 
cally,  currencies  that  are  “parallel”  exhibit  a symmetrical  behavior  between 
sell-off  and  rallies.  They  are  the  ones  where  the  trading  of the  currency  pair 
is  dominated  by flows  based  on  the  commercial  exchange  of products.  On 
the  other  hand,  the  currencies  that  act  as  investment  assets  vis-a-vis  one  an- 
other  are  going  to  behave  in  an  asymmetrical  manner.  The  German  mark 
against  the  Italian  lira,  the Spanish  peseta,  or  the  Greek  drachma  represents 
such  behavior. 

The  following  are  some  rules  to  remember: 

¢  Generally,  currencies  that  act  as  assets  present  a  strong  correlation

Reverse  Assets 

Some  assets  like  gold,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  the  Swiss  franc,  the  German 
mark,  and  the  yen,  will  exhibit  the  mirror  image  of others,  often  when  they 
behave  exactly  as  the  opposite  of a  regular  asset.  They become  the  recipient 
of the  capital  flights  away  from  regular  investment  currencies  and  equities. 

Volatility  Regimes 

The  high volatility  for  a  short  span  of time  followed  by a  low  volatility  for  a 
long  period  shows  a  “fat  tailed”  histogram  of the  distribution.  Many  appli- 
cations  of  the  Poisson  arrival  time  have  shown  consistent  results  with  the 
actual  histograms,  with  such  methods  as  the  jump  diffusion  process. 

Typically,  the  histogram  will  also  show  a  “skew”;  the  distribution  will 
be  asymmetrical  with  fat  tails  on  the  left  and  thin  tails  to  the  right.  As  de- 
scribed  earlier,  however,  the  histogram  conceals  the  sequence  of events.  The 
conditional  skew  (conditional  on  the  previous  regime  being  Type  2) is very 
high. 

These  facts  can  appear  rather  well  in  a  histogram  once  one  isolates  the 

Type  1 from  Type  2 regimes. 

Figure  15.10  shows  regime  Type  1 including  the  first  move  down  in  the 

markets  that  ensures  the  passage  into  a  Type  2 market. 

For  a  Type  1 regime  plus  transition,  a  trading  strategy  should  be  set  up 

to  benefit  from  the  following  scenarios:

Correlation  between  Interest  Rates  and  Carry 

The  major  feature  of biased  assets  is the  strong  correlation  between  interest 
rates  and  the  carry.  More  of it is explained  in  Chapter  8, which  is the  chap- 
ter  devoted  to  gamma  and  shadow  gamma. 

More  ADVANCED  PuT-CALL  PARITY  RULES 

In  general,  for  European  and  soft  American  options,  the  delta-neutral  call 
will  replicate  the  risk  profile  of  a  delta-neutral  put.  For  that  reason,  the 
volatility  of  an  in-the-money  call.needs  to  be  exactly  the  same  as  that  of 
the  offsetting  out-of-the-money  pat Henc  when  mentioning  trades  “for  a 
credit”  or  for  a  “debit,”  the  tradér  examines  the  transaction  by stripping 
every  intrinsic  portion  (adjusted  for  present  value)  out  of the  total  costs. 

Therefore,  the  contrast  between  in-the-money  and  out-of-the-money 
becomes  nonexistent  (except  for  delta  differences)  since  both  have  an 
equivalent  time  value  and  each  can  replicate  the  other  synthetically 
using  a  deterministic  instrument.  The  difference  becomes  at  the  level 
of  the  “moniness”:  how  far  in  distance  between  the  strike  and  the 
asset  price. 

Accordingly,  this  analysis  will  consider  options  as  far  as  their  “upside 
moniness”  (how  far  the  strike  is  above  the  current  asset  price),  and  their 
“downside  moniness”  (how  far  the  strike  is below  it).

For  example,  a  102  KO  call  with  a  98 outstrike  can  be  replicated  by buying  a 
102  call  knock-in  at 98  and  selling  a  vanilla  102  call.  At  the  barrier,  both  op- 
tions  will  be  square. 

This  applies  to  reverse  knock-out  options  as  well. 

American  Binary  Options. 
These  can  synthetically  be  constructed  using 
KO  with  rebates  corresponding  to  the  size  of the  bet.  Synthetically,  a  binary 
“call”  bet  (if touched)  at  104  with  a  payoff  of $2 is  a  104  knock-out  call  with 
both  strikes  and  outstrikes  of 104  (the option  will  never  be in the  money)  and 
a  rebate  of  $2.  The  rebate  can  be  interpreted  as  an  American  binary,  with 
some  possible  complications  attending  the  time  value  on  the  payment  date. 

These  have  the  same  put/call  parity  rules  as

regular  options,  but  with  a  twist:  A long call  is the  mirror  of a  short  put,  in 
vegas  and  all,  unlike  a  regular  option  that  has  a  rule  of long  call  +  delta  = 
long  put  +  deltas.  This  is  called  the  reversibility  rule  and  can  be  con- 
structed  as  follows: 

At  the  limit,  a  binary  is  a  spread.  Establish  first  the  equivalence  of 
spreads  by taking  two  theoretical  strikes  96  and  94: 

Long  a  96  P short  a  94  P long  a  net  .13  deltas  will  replicate  the  short 
94 C long a 96 C but  long .13  deltas,  surprisingly.  Unlike  a  simple  option, 
the  replication  of a  spread  is  done  through  deltas  of  the  same  side  and 
the  same  magnitude. 

By extension,  a  long binary  95 puts  long  .13  deltas  (in the  forward)  is 

equivalent  to  a  short  binary  95  calls  long  .13  deltas. 

Rainbow  Options  (Dual  or  Multiple  Strike). 
The  put-call  parity  rules  do 
not  fully hold.  For  example,  a  put on  IBM  or  Microsoft  cannot  be  replicated 
with  a  call  on  IBM  or  Microsoft  and  the  underlying  assets.  Traders  are  just 
thankful  that  the  financial  markets  do  not  present  too  many  of these.  Most 
traders  hate  these  instruments  because  of their  deception. 

Compound  Options. 
Put-call  parity  rules  hold  at  the  second  option  order 
level.  A  long  (European)  call  option  on a call  can  be  replicated  with  a  long 
put option  on  a  call  and  long  the  call,  all  of the  same  strike  and  outstrike.  A 
short  put option  on  a  put can  be  replicated  by shorting  the  call  on  the  same 
option  and  shorting  the  option,  and  so  on.  Even  third-order  options,  like  a 
call  on  a  compound  option  can  be  hedged  by using  a  put on  the  same  order 
and  the  option  one  order  below  it. 

The  breakdown  of the  put-call  parity  rules  for  an  American  option  leads 
to  the  notion  of  omega,  the  expected  life  of  the  option  (different  from  the 
nominal  duration).  It  is  therefore  preferable  to  consider  that  American

Option  Wizard:  A Vexed  Question 

There  was  a  middlebrow  swaps  head  trader  at  a  famous  institution  who  gave 
the  fear-shaken  MBAs  he  interviewed  the  following  question: 

“The  Eurodollars  are  capped  at  100.00,  and  cannot  trade  any  higher.  When 
the  market  goes  to  100.00  what  is the  price  of the  100  strike  calls?” 

“Zero,”  the  interviewee  would  answer  (proudly). 

“Right.  This  is  a good  answer.  How  about  the  put?” 

“...”  (silence,  a  lengthy  silence). 

“Well”  the  swaps  trader  would  announce,  “you  failed  my  test,  the  put 
should  trade  for  zero.  Don’t  you  understand  put-call  parity  rules?  Perhaps 
you  should  get  a  job  in  manufacturing  or  in  the  accounting  department  of 
some  corporation.” 

One  day,  the  swaps  trader  met  his  match  in  the  person  of  a  friend  of the 
author,  a  veteran  quantitative  trader  (quite  a  rare  breed).  The  swaps  trader 
started  his  usual  bullying,  and  the  veteran  answered: 

“Your  question  makes  no  sense.  If your  axiom  is that  the  Eurodollar  market 
cannot  possibly  go  to  100  (rates  go  to  zero),  then  there  is  an  incoherence 
in  the  reasoning.  The  market  could  approach  0, but  the  volatility  would  be 
such  that  it would  take  eternity  to  get  there. 
“Second,  there  is  a worse  conclusion:  A market  that  reaches  100  (assuming 
it is bounded  there)  would  be  dead  and  offer  no  volatility  whatsoever. 
“There  are  many  explanations  for  that.  An  explanation  in  trader’s  terms  is 
that  a  market  that  goes  to  100  would  be  in  itself  a  free  option.  So  traders 
can  sell  at  100.00  knowing  that  it would  be  free  money:  They  can  partake 
of  a  sell-off  without  a  possible  rally!  Knowing  that  if the  market  has  any 
volatility  in  it, traders  would  sell  it at  99.99  thus  paying a tick  for  the  per- 
petual  option,  and  so  forth.  The  market  then  would  settle  at  a  price  where 
your  call  would  be  worth  more  than  zero. 

“In  mathematical  language,  a  market  trading  at  100  would  be  degenerate, 
which  then  would  make  your  question  about  puts  and  calls  superfluous.” 
The  quantitative  trader  did  not  get the  job (to  his  great  luck).  One  result  of 
the  conversation,  however,  is  that  the  swaps  head  trader  stopped  asking  his 
question.

options  need  to be priced  on a term structure  of  volatility  that  is  shorter 
than  the nominal  European  one.  At all times,  an  option  on  one  strike  will  be 
close to the European  (the out-of-the-money  one  with  longer  expected  life) 
while  the  counter  option  will  be priced  as  an  American. 

Ata  more  advanced  level,  one  needs  to  examine  the  skew  effect.  Put-call 
parity  being  suspended,  the  deep  in-the-money  option  would  obey  the 
early  exercise  rules,  which  would  translate,  in  addition  to  the  term  struc- 
ture  effect,  into  a  different  skew.

Option  Trading  Concepts 

Hiring  a  trader  is like  selling  volatility.  If he does  very  well  or  very  poorly,  you  are 
out of a job. 

An  old  option  proverb 

This  chapter  provides  the  necessary  definitions  of option  trading  concepts 
covered  elsewhere  in  the  book. 

JF Officialy gption  replication  corresponds  to a self-financing  method  to 
replicate  the  payoffs  of  an  option  instrument  with  some  other  instru- 
ments  (Figure  16.1).  In  practice,  option  replication  ts  a  broader  concept 
that  covers  all  operations  done  through  options. 

J static replication  is a  risk  management  strategy  that  consists  in finding 
a  match  for  an  option  position  that  does  not  require  continuous  rebal- 
ancing.  Static  replication  aims  at  both  reducing  the  P/L  variance  from 
the  trade  and  minimizing  the  transaction  costs. 

The  first  and  easiest  static  replication  is the  put-call-asset  arbitrage  where  a 
call  is synthetically  made  into  a  put and  so  on. 

The  reader  should  be  warned  against  the  static  replication  of  instru- 
ments  that  have  a  stopping  time  (i.e.,  an  unstable  duration)  with  instruments 
that  have  a  constant  duration.  This  topic  will  be covered  in the  discussion  of 
binary  and  barrier  options. 

Finally,  there  is  the  need  to  distinguish  between  decomposition  and 
replication.  Many  trades  require  operators  to  decompose  them  as  a  value 
discovery  method  and  a  hedging  orientation.  Decomposition  can  reveal 
the  skew  risks,  for  example.  In  most  cases,  however,  the  replication  will  be 
impractical. 

Uicas replication  via  the  rolling  back  of  the  risks  on  a  binomial  tree 

(Derman’s  method)!  consists  in taking  the  final  payoff  of the  security,  con- 
structing  a  binomial  tree  around  it, and  trying  to  replicate  the  payoff  at  al- 
most  every  node  of the  tree.  Such  a  method  can  be  helpful  in  hedging  the 
risks  of some  barrier  options.  We  will  show  an  adaptation  to  such  method 
where,  in place  of the  payoff,  both  the  payoffs  and  the  Greeks  are  matched.

7 

The  difference  with  the  operation  in  Figure  16.2’is  that  a  dynamic  hedger 
does  not  look  for  trades  that  completely  neutralize  the  tree. 

Dynamic  hedging  concerns  all  the  Greeks  in the  book.  It starts  with  the 
rebalancing  of  the  deltas  (as  the  market  moves  or  as  the  delta  bleeds  with 
time).  As  gammas  change,  it involves  the  adjustment  through  options  to  re- 
duce  or  increase  gammas  and  the  consequent  time  decay.  As  markets  move, 
Rhol  and  Rho2  need  to  be  adjusted  and  so  on. 

One  matter  worthy  of  mentioning  concerning  dynamic  hedging:  It 

makes  every  option  become  path  dependent. 

@ ( Neutral  spreading  is  an  option  trading  technique  that  consists  in  buy- 
ing a  certain  quantity_of  options  against  selling  another,  all  of different 
strikes  and  expiration/It  is  a  form  of  dynamic  hedging  that  allows  for 
some  Greek  risk  provided  there  is proper  compensation  for  it. 

In  floor  trading  lore,  a  spreader  is someone  who  matches  the  “red”  tickets 
with  the  “blue”  ones  (originally  on  the  exchanges  red  tickets  were  sales  and 
blue  tickets  were  buys). 

While  there  are  varying  degrees  of  neutral  spreading,  it  is  generally 
assumed  that  if someone  buys  an  option  and  sells  another,  provided  their 
strikes  and  expirations  are  sufficiently  near  one  another,  the  ability  to 
capture  “value”  is greatly  enhanced.  The  study  of biased  assets  will  show 

Option  Trading  Concepts 

259 

that  the  spreader  needs  some  additional  constraints  in  some  markets 
where  the  skew  makes  “downside”  strikes  remarkably  dissimilar  to  “up- 
side”  ones. 

Most  successful  option  trading  firms  were  started  by spreaders,  and,  to 
this  day,  the  most  successful  one  ever,  Swiss  Bank  Corporation  (in its  asso- 
ciation  with  O’Connor  and  Company,  originally  a successful  Chicago  Board 
Options  Exchange  [CBOE]  market  maker  firm),  requires  floor  experience 
from  its  traders  to  hone  their  spreading  skills. 

Sophistication  in  spreading  is  usually  obtained  only  by dint  of experi- 
ence.  How  some  instruments  marry  with  each  other  can  certainly  be  deter- 
mined  theoretically,  but  as  with  most  games,  only  thorough  practice  would 
allow  the  person  to  be  able  to  match  an  option  with  another. 

Classical  spreading  techniques  can  be  easily  extended  to  the  exotic  op- 
tions  arena:  Many  of the  rules  are  common.  However,  the  distance  between 
strikes  and  expirations  becomes  more  difficult  to  assess. 

The  value  of spreading  as  a market-making  technique  is greatly  appreci- 
ated  by the  exchanges  and  the  financial  backers,  since  such  traders  com- 
monly  have  easy  access  to  capital  and  the  exchanges  allow  them  great 
leverage. 

The  advantages  of spreading  include: 

*  Capturing  of Central  Limit. 

The  market  maker  can  reduce  the  vari- 
ance  (read  luck)  and  maximize  the  drift  (read  skills).  The  notion  is 
described  in Chapter  3. 

¢  Insulation  from  the  Risks  of the Formula. 

Generally,  trading  options 
against  options  is  a  serious  way  to  be  protected  from  the  imperfec- 
tions  of Black-Scholes-Merton  (or others).  Assume  that,  with  the  mar- 
ket  trading  at  100,  the  at-the-money  options  puts  and  calls  struck  at 
100  show  an  implied  Black-Scholes-Merton  volatility  of  15.7%.  Re- 
gardless  of  the  effect  of  the  formula  and  the  distribution,  put-call 
parity  arbitrage  will  make  puts  and  calls  of the  same  strike  and  expi- 
ration  trade  at  the  same  time  value  (hence  the  same  volatility). 

Suppose  that  the  market  for  the  104  calls  shows a volatility  of 16.2 
and  that  the  market  of the  104.5  calls  shows a volatility  of 15.5.  Sell- 
ing  the  104  calls  and  buying  the  104.5  calls  while  adjusting  the 
amounts  to  satisfy  a  low  residual  gamma  and  delta  neutrality  seems 
to  be  a  good  idea.  Should  one  discover  (as  many  did)  that  Black- 
Scholes-Merton  underprices  out-of-the-money  options,  there  will  be 
no  material  effect  on  the trade:  Both  options  would  be  affected.  Con- 
versely,  should  one  discover  that  Black-Scholes-Merton  overprices 
the upside  (which  would  be  true  in biased  assets),  the same will be 
true.  The  strikes  are  sufficiently  close  together  for  the  spread  to  be 
impervious  to  the  formula.

©  Realization  of Theoretical  Edge. 

Trading  options  against  options 
proves  to  be  a  safe  way  to  hedge  against  the  host  of second,  third  de- 
rivatives,  and  so  on  that  plague  the  trader: 

First  Level:  Delta  neutrality  (including  the  rho1,  rho2). 
Second  Level:  Gamma  neutrality. 
Third  Level:  Vega  neutrality. 

M  Theoretical  edge  is  the  difference  between  the  trading  price  of one  in- 

strument  and  some  defined  fair  value. 

It is safe  to  see  how  a  spread  sometimes  confers  such  a  theoretical  edge: 

1.  Insulation  from  the  Broad  Set  of  Parameters.  There  was  a  market 
maker  on  the  floor  of  the  CBOE  who  attributes  his  survival  to  the 
fact  that  he only  traded  calls. 

2.  An  Effectual  Market-Making  Device.  Options  are  generally  indi- 
vidually  illiquid  while  the  general  market  is very  liquid.  That  is the 
reason,  as  mentioned  earlier,  that  the  active  market  makers  can  se- 
cure  easy  financing.  The  more  active  the  trader, the more  profitable 
he will  be at  the  end  if  he  keeps  transacting  “above”  or  “below”  the- 
oretical  value.?  Some  market  maker  firms,.impose  a  volume  require- 
ment  on  their  traders  to  force  them  into  activity.  By forcing  them  to 
trade  actively  under  severe  gamma  and  theta  constraints,  they  can 
ensure  that  the  traders  are  satisfying  some  budget  requirements. 

INITIATION  TO  VOLATILITY  TRADING: 
VEGA  VERSUS  GAMMA 

Risk  Management  Rule: 
“Long”  or  “short”  volatility  carries  no 
true  risk  management  meaning.  One  needs  to  qualify  the  gammas 
(with  a  range)  and  the  vegas. 

The  expression  “long  and  short  volatility”  is not  an  expression  that  can 
be  used  by a  dynamic  hedger.  In  the  early  1980s,  it was  difficult  for  traders 
to  explain  to  the  bleary-eyed  bosses  the  difference  between  gamma  and 
vega.  Typically  for  one  option,  the  position  would  be  straightforward  since 
it will  be  long or  short  both. 

X once  worked  (briefly)  for  a  boss  who  attributed  his  expertise  in  op- 
tion  trading  to  the  fact  that  he had  been  extremely  profitable  once  (acciden- 
tally)  on  an  option  position.  X was  short  calendars  and  was  asked  whether 
X was  long  or  short  volatility.  X was  short  volatility  but  that  he  wanted  the

if he  is  continuously  long  gamma,  long  up-gamma,  down-gamma, 
or  if the  gamma  flips  sgmewhere.

es  away  from  the  money.  The  rea- 
A calendar  spread  has  a 
son  is  that  a  calendar  seller  can  only  hope  to  make  a  limited  sum  of money 
from  the  calendar  (generally  the  credit  for  an  at-the-money  calendar).  An  op- 
erator  willing  to  bet  against  the  wings  has  several  options:  Either  play  the 
out-of-the-money  options  against  the  at-the-money,  or,  more  easily  play  the 
calendar. 

By  applying  a  ratio  to  the  time  spread,  the  operator  can  achieve  a 
gamma  that  would  remain  neutral  to  mildly  short  at-the-money  but  that  be- 
comes  rapidly  very  positive  in  the  wings. 

SOFT  VERSUS  HARD  DELTAS 

MON soft  delta  execution  is a  delta  hedge  done  through  an  option,  that,  ac- 
cordingly,  vanishes  asymptotically  (to  the  asset  price).  A  hard  delta 
does  not  vanish  at  the  limit  of the  move  in  the  underlying  asset. 

Soft  deltas  are  generally  used  to  cover  secondary  deltas  (i.e.,  deltas  arising 
from  market  moves)  that  cannot  be  hedged  with  a  hafd  delta  without  in- 
creasing  the  risks  in  the  extremes. 

Example: 
The  trader  has  the  following  position  on  the  books:  long  at- 
the-money  option  and  short  larger  quantities  of out-of-the-money  calls:

At  106,  the  trader  has  some  profits  stemming  from  the  long  deltas.  Sell-

Someti 
to  sell  deltas  is by shifting 
strikes  (i.e,  moving  the 
center  of the  gamma  closer  to  the  short  zone).  At  the  beginning,  the  clumps 

Option  Trading  Concepts 

263 

of long gamma  were  centered  around  100  and  the  short  gamma  around  112. 
The  rally should  give the  trader  the  opportunity  to  shift  the  center  from  100 
to  106,  thus  stabilizing  the  position.  The  best  possible  hedge  in this  case  is a 
soft  delta  (buying  options  struck  in the  106  zone)  added  to a selling  options 
struck  in the  100  zone.  The  next  step,  should  the  rally continue,  would  be  to 
move  the  longs  into  the  112  zone  by repeating  the  operation. 

Recommendation.  In  the  rebalancing  of  an  option  position,  the  trader 
needs  to  perform  the  following  test:  Does  the  gamma  flip the  other  way?  If 
the  long  gamma  flips  into  a  negative  gamma,  it will  be  very  dangerous  to 
sell  “hard”  deltas  (i.e.,  cash  or  futures)  because  the  P/L  would  then  turn 
out  to be  worse  in the  tails  of the  matrix. 

VOLATILITY  BETTING 

A, 

These  trades  can  involve  more  than  one  option.  All  options  considered  in 
this  section  are  vanilla. 

@  A  first-order  volatility  trade  using  vanilla  options  is  a  trade  that  satis- 

fies  the  following  conditions: 

¢ 

¢ 

e 

It is monotonically  long  or  short  volatility  though  without  necessar- 
ily having  a  constant  gamma. 
Its  vegas  and  gammas  are  on  the  same  side  of the  market. 

It is intended  to  be  delta  neutral. 

These  characteristics  apply  to  simple  option  trades:  long straddles,  long 
strangles,  and  so  on.  Any form  of trading  where  all  options  are  long or  short 
would  satisfy  such  rules  (Table  16.1). 

First-order  volatility  trades  present  the  advantages  of  being  tractable, 
with  a  P/L  that  is  easy  to  forecast  (Figure  16.3).  They  represent  positions 
with  a  smaller  degree  of complexity.

First-order  volatility  trade. 

H  A second-order  volatility  trade  is an  option  trade  that  includes  long and 
short  options  of different  strikes  or  different  maturities  but  within  the 
confines  of one  product.  It is characterized  by the  following: 

¢  The  gamma  always  flip from  positive  to  negative  on  the  map. 

¢ 

Its  raw  vega  can  change  sign  somewhere  along  the  lines  (this  is not 
an  essential  condition). 

e 

Its  weighted  vega  always  reverses  somewhere  on  the  map. 

¢  Owing  to  its  complexity,  graphical  representation  in two  dimensions 

often  becomes  irrelevant  and  of weak  revealing  powers. 

A  call  spread  (one  by one),  such  as  buying  the  102  calls  selling  the  106 
calls  in  equal  amounts,  will  exhibit  the  characteristics  of a  single  call  when 
the  market  is  at  100.  Should  the  market  rally  to  104,  however,  it  will  then 
have  the  zero-gamma,  positive  down-gamma,  negative  up-gamma  that  char- 
acterizes  a  risk  reversal. 

A  ratio  spread  where  the  operator  buys  the  102  calls  and  sells  twice  as 

much  of the  106  calls  will  present  opposite  characteristics. 

Higher  Moment  Bets 

@  A  third  moment  bet  is  a  form  of  distribution  arbitrage  where a bet  is 
made  on  the  correlation  between  the  volatility  of  a  particular  market 
and  the  asset  price. 

ad 

A  fourth  moment  bet  is long  or  short  the  volatility  of volatility.  It could 
be  achieved  either  with  out-of-the-money  options  or  with  calendars. 

Example:  (A ratio  “backspread”  or  reverse  spread  is  a method  that  in- 
cludes  the buying  of out-of-the-money  options  in  large amounts  and  the 
selling  of  smaller  amounts  of  at-the-money  but  making  sure  the  trade 
satisfies  the  “credit”  rule  (i.e.,  the  trade  initially  generates  a  positive 
cash  flow).)The  credit  rule  is more  difficult  to  interpret  when  one  uses 

Option  Trading  Concepts 

265 

in-the-money  options.  In that  case,  one  should  deduct  the  present  value 
of  the  intrinsic  part  of  every  option  using  the  put-call  parity  rule  to 
equate  them  with  out-of-the-money. 

. 

ne  trade  shown  in Figure  16.4  was  accomplished  with  the  purchase  of both 
out-of-the-money  puts  and  out-of-the-money  calls  and  the  selling  of smaller 
amounts  of at-the-money  straddles  of the  same  maturity. 

Figure  16.5  shows  the  second  method,  which  entails  the  buying  of  60- 
day  options  in  some  amount  and  selling  20-day  options  on  80%  of  the 
amount. 

Both  trades  show  the  position  benefiting  from  the  fat  tails  and  the  high 
peaks.  Both  trades,  however,  will  have  different  vega  sensitivities,  but  close 
to  flat  modified  vega. 

Case  StTuDy:  PATH  DEPENDENCE  OF  A 
REGULAR  OPTION 

The  following  illustrates  the  degree  to  which  option  replication  could  be 
path  dependent. 

This  case  study  uses  a  string  of  returns’,  including  a  beginning  price 
and  the  end  price,  and  its  volatility.  With  these  numbers,  it  is  possible  to 
reshuffle  a  high  number  of  sequences  while  the  beginning  price,  the  end 
price,  and  the  volatility  remain  the  same.

Asset  Price 

To  show  how  to  create  the  price  movement,  a  sequence  of percentage  re- 
turns  is  taken,  say,  1%,  5%,  —1%,  —5%.  A  security  starts  at  100.  The  next 
price  is  100  (1 +  .01)  =  101.  The  next  price  is  101  x  (1 +  .05)  =  1.0605.  The 
next  price  is  106.05  X  (1 —  .01)  =  1.0499.  The  next  price  is 1.0499  x  (1 —  .05) 
=  99.74  (the  final  price).  The  price  sequence  is then  100,  101,  1.0605,  1.0499, 
99.74.  Mix  the  preceding  returns,  and  get 5%,  —5%,  —1%,  1%.  The  price  se- 
quence  will  therefore  be  100,  105,  99.75,  98.75,  99.74,  quite  a  different  path. 

In  the  following  example,  the  goal  is  to  replicate  252  trading  days  by 
taking  an  arbitrary  distribution  with  a  15.6%  volatility  (average  movement 
1%  per  business  day)  and  reshuffle  it into  106  different  paths. 

All  the  prices  start  at  100  and  end  at  98.6.  Figure  16.6  shows  eight  sam- 
ple paths  and  illustrates  the  discrepancy  in  the  paths  that  can  result:  One 
path  shows  a  high  of 127,  the  other  shows  a  high  of 105.  It is again  counter- 
intuitive  that  both  have  the  same  mean  and  the  same  volatility.  Indeed, 
some  of the  shuffled  results  have  a  yearly  range  of 10%  while  others  have  a 
yearly  range  of 60%. 

Figure  16.6  shows  only  eight  of  the  paths  used  in  the  analysis  for  the 

sake  of clarity. 

The  trader  buys $10  million  of a  one-year  European  call  option  struck  at 
100  and  rebalances  the  delta  daily.  European  options  are  said  to  be  path in- 
dependent,  therefore  only  the  final  outcome  matters  for  them.  Table  16.2 
shows  the  profit  and  loss  from  a  strategy  that  would  buy  volatility  at  the 
exact  15.6%  and  hedge,  without  transaction  costs,  at  the  close  of every  day. 
This  author  once,  for  his  amusement,  posed  the  problem  to  three  cate- 
gories  of people:  the  junior  trader,  the  experienced  trader,  and  the  trading

manager.  Most  junior  traders  and  trading  managers  rehashed  what  they 
knew  from  the  training  packages  that  volatility  was  volatility  and  the  order 
of events  did  not  matter.  Experienced  traders  explained  that  we  were  deal- 
ing  with  a  discrete,  not  continuous  time  world  and  that  there  would  be  a 
variance  that  would  be  a  function  of transaction  frequency.  The  interesting 
result  is that  all  of the  experienced  traders  got the  answer  right  and  all  the 
trading  managers  got it wrong.  The  financial  community  is still  largely  un- 
aware  of the  poor  tracking  of the  risks  through  dynamic  hedging. 

Most  experienced  traders  explained  that  it  was  preferable,  when  lo 
gamma,  to  have  the  large  moves  when  gamma  is  at  the  maximum  and  the 
small  moves  when  the  market  is furthest  away  from  the  strike.

The  results  show  how  path  dependent  the  world  can  be  for  a  dynamic 
hedger.  The  preceding  example  shows  a  simple  position  that  is  monotoni- 
cally  long gamma.  The  next  position  is initially  close  to  flat  gamma  but  pre- 
sents  mixed  features. 

Table  16.3  represents  the  following  risk  reversal:  Long  $100  million  of 
the  90  call,  short  $100  million  of the  110  call  and  delta  neutral.  The  delta,  as 
before,  is rebalanced  daily.  The  results  are  quite  unsettling. 

The  distribution  that  caused  such  P/L  had  no  skew;  generally  there  was 
no  difference  between  down-volatility  and up-volatility.  There  was  also  no 
correlation  between  the  volatility  of the  market  and  the  level  of the  underly- 
ing asset.  In  short,  a  clean  distribution,  extremely  theoretical. 

This  suggests  the  following  trade-off:  The  only  way  to  reduce  path  de- 
pendence  is  to  increase  the  transaction  frequency.  Such  increase  in  the 
transaction  frequency  will  raise  the  costs  of trading.  The  impact  can  be  fur- 
ther  compounded  because  a  negative  gamma  trader  incurs  higher  such 
costs  than  a  positive  gamma  counterpart. 

Many  heads  of trading  rooms,  underestimating  the  impact  of the  path, 
will  issue  comments  such  as,  “On  balance,  in  the  long  run,  I will  eventually 
capture  the  ‘edge’  in  the  market.”  Most  of them  are  unaware  of the  follow- 
ing rule:  In  options,  variance  of P/L  is usually  underestimated.  One  needs 
more  diversification.  One  of the  rules  of diversification,  which  is diversifi- 
cation  through  time,  does  not  properly  work  owing  to  the  leverage  and  the 
fact  that  traders  are  continuously  monitored  by  a  nonstatistical  person 
breathing  down  their  neck.  Moreover,  the  life  of a  trader  is too  short  for  ad- 
equate  time  diversification. 

In  the  real  market,  the  results  will  certainly  be  worse,  for  the  following 

reasons: 

e  The  trader  usually  will  hedge  himself,  when  short  gamma,  with  stop 
losses,  which  increase  the  costs  and  causes  a  higher  incidence  of 
whipsaws. 

Option  Trading  Concepts 

269 

e  Most  markets  exhibit  some  form  of a  skew. 

¢  Traders  have  some  form  of  absorbing  barrier  in  their  P/L.  Many  of 
the  106  runs  had  losses  in  excess  of the  final  worst-case  apparent  re- 
sult  of  $600,000.  If we  stopped  a  trader  at  $300,000,  we  would  have 
many  more  negative  runs. 

e  Perhaps  the  element  that  would  make  the  preceding  spread  widest  is 
implied  volatility.  It is  assumed  that  the  trade  is  only  adjusted  with 
the  asset,  not  with  options.  Seeing  the  P/L  of every  path  and  analyz- 
ing  the  P/L  volatility  would  show  that  some  of  them  are  scary.

Measuring  Option  Risks 

The  preceding  position  becomes  long or  short  vega  at  some  level,  and 
adjustments  would  worsen  the  final  spread. 

The  following  basic  example  was  designed  by the  author  in  his  forma- 

tive  years  to  satisfy  a  bet  with  one  of his  colleagues. 

SIMPLE  CASE  StTuDy:  THE  “WorsT  CASE”  SCENARIO 

Inexperienced  risk  managers  typically  describe  an  option  risk  as  being  the 
premium  when  one  is long  and  conversely  when  one  is short.  This  does  not 
apply  for  a  dynamic  hedger.  This  case  study,  with  a  simple  example  will 
show  how  a  premium  seller  can  earn  more  than  the  initial  premium  col- 
lected  and  a  premium  buyer  can  lose  more  than  the  expenditure. 

An  out-of-the-money  call  has  a  20%  delta. 

Asset  price:  100.° 
Strike  price:  104. 

Days  to  expiration:  30. 

Prices  19, 

Amount:  $10,000,000. 

Initial  premium:  $190,000. 
It would  appear  that  a  buyer  of  the  call  would  only  lose  the  premium, 
$190,000,  not  more. 

It is  apparently  a  very  safe  trade.  Look  at  the  worst-case  scenario  for  a 

delta  hedger:  Initial  delta:  $280,000.  The  hedger  sells  the  entire  amount. 

Look  at the  P/L  table  over  the  next  30  days:  The  path followed  by the  un- 

derlying  is particularly  vicious  as  it rallies  daily  (see  Table  16.4). 

It is easy  to  see  that  dynamic  hedging  got  our  man  in  trouble,  causing 
losses  of  $440,000  where  they  should  have  been  limited  to  $190,000.  Such 
events  are  rather  common  (though  rarely  to  such  an  extreme)  with  trends 
where  out-of-the-money  options  on  the  side  of the  trend  decay  mercilessly 
and  delta  hedgers  end  up  losing  on  both  the  option  and  the  delta  hedge.

TRADING  AND  HEDGING 
EXOTIC  OPTIONS 

In  Part  HI  of  this  book,  the  focus  is  on  the  risks  of  the  major  exotic  options 
from  the  standpoint  of the  dynamic  hedger  (and  the  informed  customer).  In 
place of an  anecdotal  enumeration  of all  the  possible  instruments,  the  discus- 
sion  will  concentrate  on  the  hedging  techniques  through  decomposition  of 
the  blocks  of risks. 

Risk  managers  who  never  traded  before  will  learn  that: 

¢  The  risk  of  any  soft  path-dependent  option  can  only  be  understood 
through  thorough  grounding  in  American  binary  options  and  stop- 
ping times.  Typically,  they commit  the  tragic  mistake  of loading  their 
minds  with  peripheral  notions,  most  of which  are  related  to  pricing. 

e  Understanding  multi-asset  options  needs  to  come  from  the  notion  of 
matrix  analysis  and  cross-gammas  by intuitively  looking  at  the  covari- 
ance  matrix  as  one  volatility.  In  addition,  every  structure  can  become 
multi-assets  through  correlation  hedging. 

e  Understanding  non-time-homogeneous  risks  needs  to  come  from  the 
grounding  in  calendar  spreading  and  the  learning  about  the  notions 
of  forward  volatility,  not  through  the  dissection  of  deferred  options 
and  other  minor  varieties. 

In  this  text,  Asian  options  and  lookbacks  are  subjects  of minor  impor- 
tance.  Asian  options  are  simply  an  application  of a  basket  methodology  (the 
basket  is  in  time),  and  lookbacks  can  be  thought  of as  a  simple  footnote  on 
barrier  options. 

Finally  it is  necessary  to  stress  that  training  in  exotic  options  is  often 
better  performed  with  a  good  basic  and  structured  education  in  vanilla 
puts  and  calls.  Conventional  option  trading  provides  a  good  training  in  the 
failings  of the  distributions.  This  refers  to  what  has  been  described  as  com- 
plex  trading  with  simple  instruments  as  opposed  to  simple  trading  with 
complex  instruments.

Options  that  are  trivial  to  price  (like  binary  options)  are  difficult  to  hedge.  Op- 
tions  that  are  difficult  to price  (like  Asian  options)  are  trivial  to hedge. 

Howard  Savery,  Exotic  Options  Trader 

The  next  two  chapters  are  devoted  to  the  trading  issues  related  to  bet  op- 
tions.  The  reader  needs  to  complete  these  chapters  before  attempting  to  un- 
derstand  barrier  options.  To  make  the  progression  easier,  the  discussion 
will  start  with  European  binary  options,  as  the  concept  of the  “pin”  needs 
to  be  well  understood  before  proceeding  with  American  binary  options, 
which  add  the  complexity  of an  unknown  and  highly  unstable  “duration,” 
or  stopping  time. 

The  concept  of the  pin is so  central  to  understanding  both  option  theory 
and  practice  that  this  author  started  originally  writing  the  book  with  that 
topic  in  mind  and  had  to  compose  all  the  previous  chapters  to  provide  the 
reader  with  the  tools  to  master  the  risks  of the  barrier  structure.  For  a  hard- 
working  person,  however,  a  thorough  knowledge  of  barriers  and  digitals 
provides  appropriate  training  in  handling  the  risks  of  what  exotic  traders 
call  the  “junior  stuff.” 

Binary  options  are  perhaps  the  best  training  ground  for  a  trader  as  they 
can  teach  more  about  advanced  book  management.  At  the  heart  of most  ex- 
otic  structure  and  every  bet  resides  a  binary.  It also  provides  an  advanced 
test  of the  skills  of any  risk  manager:  Many  experienced  risk  managers  who 
fail  the  binary  exam  should  perhaps  consider  some  serious  retraining. 

Barrier  options  are  also  difficult  to  comprehend  for  risk  managers  with  a 
superficial  knowledge  of options.  Ironically,  traders  with  shallow  experience 
commonly  misunderstand  these  options  even  though  they  dabble  in  them; 
whereas  the  often-more-qualified  trainees  master  the  barrier  options.  They 
invariably  allowed  the  author  to  distinguish  between  the  true  experienced 
risk  manager  and  those  who  needed  further  training.

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

vs A  binary  option  pays  a  single  sum  upon  the  satisfaction  of  the  obliga- 
tion.  It is called  binary  because,  like  0 or  1, it either pays  the  full  amount 
or  zero,  with  nothing  in between. 

This  discontinuous  payoff  makes  binary  options  particularly  hard  to  hedge 
using  regular  structures  that  present  a  continuous  payoff. 

The  opposite  of a  binary  or  gap  payoff  is a  ramp,  or  conventional  option. 

Binary  options  can  be  either  American  or  European. 

ve A  European  binary  option  is  a  bet  on  the  asset  being  higher  or  lower 
than  a  certain  level  at  expiration.  American  bets  are  “if  touched”  types 
that  will  terminate  the  bet  upon  an  event  at  any  moment  between  incep- 
tion  and  expiration  and  are  thus  more  difficult  to  hedge. 

Some  variations  that  can  be both  American  and  European  will  be  examined. 
European  binaries  can  thus  have  only  one  strike,  unlike  American  ones  that 
can  be  of the  either-or  type.  There  are  no  double  bets  per  se,  as  a European 
double  bet  can  be  constructed  as  the  sum  of two  independent  bets. 

Binary  options  are  present  in  many  structures,  as  a European  or  Amer- 
ican  type.  Contingent  premium  options  are  a  simple  construction  of Euro- 
pean  vanilla  options  plus a bet  that  pays  the initial  premium  if the  option  is 
in the 

money. 

" 

Common  trading  beliefs  hold  that  a  European  bet  is  easy  to  hedge  ex- 
cept  close  to  expiration,  where  the  delta  becomes  explosive  as  spot  enters 
the  neighborhood  of the  strike.)It  will  be  shown  that  it is difficult  to  hedge 
in  both  circumstances.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  much  money  was  unwittingly 
lost  in the  daily  management  of a  digital  with  a  long  time  to  its  expiration. 
One  reason  traders  get  an  accelerated  training  with  bet  options  is  that 

'  their  delta  imitate  the  gamma  of a  regular  option. 
|  Often  European  bet  options  exhibit  parameter  linearity  problems  that 

make  hedging  their  vega  particularly  difficult  for  a dynamic  hedger. 

Figure  17.1  shows  that  a  binary  option  is short  gamma  and  earning  theta 
(but  moderately)  when  it is  in  the  money  and  long  gamma  and  paying  time 
decay  when  it is out  of the  money.  Exactly  at  the  money,  it loses  all  its  option- 
ality  and  acts  like  a  future.  This  risk-reversal  feature  for  a  barrier  appears  to 
facilitate  their  hedging  with  a  few  skewed  instruments.  It will  be shown  that 
the  appropriate  hedge  for  a  barrier  is a  narrow  spread,  done  in  such a size  as 
to  compound  the  skew  effect.  Most  of all, barriers  need  to  be priced  with  the 
skew  structure  of the  market  in mind.  In  a  commodity  that  becomes  volatile 
after  a  sell-off  and  loses  steam  after  a  rally,  such  a  structure  can  indeed  be 
very  favorable  unless  the price of the barrier  includes  a compensation  for such 
imbalance  (with  the  volatility  differential  we  call  the  skew). 

Look  carefully  in the  microscope  at the  part  that  is long gamma  (the left 

side  of the  figure).

Mixed  convexity  of a  European  binary. 

What  causes  the  long  gamma  is  the  local  convexity.  A  binary  will  pre- 
sent  a  positive  leverage  when  it is out  of the  money  (the  trader  is risking  less 
to  make  more)  and  negative  leverage  otherwise  (the  trader  is  risking  more 
to  make  less).  If the  bet  pays  one  dollar  at  expiration  and  is currently  worth 
one  penny,  it will  present  very  large  convexity  features.  It can  thus  pick  up 
99  cents  and  lose  1 only.  This  would  look  like  a  long gamma  structure. 

Figure  17.2  shows  no  true  difficulty  in  protecting  the  vega  and  gamma 
of the  binary  using  ordinary  vanilla  options.  As  expiration  nears,  however, 
the  profile  would  start  sliding  toward  the  pin  exposure.  Figure  17.3  shows 
the  price  sensitivity  nearing  expiration.  The  graph  will  become  more  and 
more  vertical  for  a narrow  segment  and  flat  otherwise. 

Hedging  witha  Vanilla 

Look  at  the  shape  of  Figure  17.3  and  try  to  find  the  profile  of  a  structure 
that  would  imitate  such  a  payoff.  The  first  option  to  come  to  mind  is the  call 
spread. 

Option  Wizard:  Risk  Reversal  (revisited) 

A risk  reversal,  as  defined  in  this  book,  corresponds  to  situations  where  the 
gamma  and/or  vegas  flip from  positive  to  negative  across  one  point. 

Initially,  a  risk  reversal  corresponded  to  fences  (out-of-the-money  call  pur- 
chase  financed  with  the  sale  of a  put)  but  rapidly  option  traders  started  refer- 
ring  to  it as  a  description  of  asymmetric  risk  in  an  option  position.  It became 
the  third  moment. 

A  risk  reversal  for  a  book  manager  is the  switch  in  risk  across  one  point. 
The  best  description  of a  risk  reversal  to  date*:  “It  is  like  buying  drought  insur- 
ance  and  financing  it with  flood  insurance.”

The  difference  between  Figure  17.3  and  Figure  17.4  lies  in the  scale.  The 
shapes  are  very  similar.  This  shows  that  the binary  is really  a  call  spread  in 
disguise.  It presents  all  such  features:  long  gamma  where  the  proximity  of 
the  long leg makes  it dominate  (below  the  long)  and  short  gamma  where  the 
proximity  of  the  short  leg makes  it dominate  (above  the  short).  So  the  mi- 
croscopic  call  spread  is long gamma  below  100  and  short  gamma  above.  Like 
a  conventional  option,  the  gamma  weakens  away  from  the  strike,  and  the 
combination  peaks  at  a  certain  spot.  In between,  it looks  like  a  risk  reversal.

Figure  17.4 

A  call  spread  nearing  expiration. 

One  additional  piece  of information,  critical  to  understand  the  similar- 
ity between  the  two  positions:  They  are  both  European,  path-independent, 
and  share  a common  expiration  date.  As  the  difference  resides  merely  in the 
scale,  the  increase  in the  size  of one  should  perfectly  replicate  the  other. 

The  next  step  is to  compute  the  face  value  of the  call  spread  that  is fit  to 

hedge  the  barrier. 

Assume  the  payoff  of  the  barrier  is  $100  per  unit  if the  bet  is  satisfied 
and  none  if the  bet  is not  satisfied.  So  the  amount  of the  call  spread  should 
be  such  that  one  tick  represents  $100.  So  the  trader  would  need  the  miserly 
amount  of 10,000  units  of the  call  spread.  Such  replication,  however,  only be- 
comes  effective  everywhere  on  the  map  of risk-neutral  possible  outcomes  if there 
is no  zone  in  which  it fails  to  track  the  other  leg.  In  this  example,  the  trader 
selected  a  market  that  moved  in indivisible  “ticks”  of .01.  Should  the  market 
trade  in  discrete  increments  of  .05,  his  task  would  be  made  easier  as  the 
replicating  amounts  could  thus  be smaller  (2,000  units). 

Option  Wizard:  Dividing  a  Tick 

The  exchanges  make  it illegal  to  shave  a  “tick”  into  smaller  increments. 

Traders  could  otherwise  trade  in  smaller  units  by dividing  the  trade.  Imag- 
ine  that  the  market  moved  in  minimum  increments  of  .01.  Buying  50  lots  at 
100.00  and  50  lots  at  100.01  from  the  same  person  would  accomplish  a 
“ginzy,”  as  the  average  would  be  100.005. 

The  exchanges  did  not  make  buying  at  two  different  prices  illegal,  they 
made  the  trading  with  the  intention  of breaking  up  the  tick  into  smaller  prices 
an  illegal  operation.  What  is illegal  is telling  a  trader:  “|  will  buy some  from  you 
at  100.01  if you  also  will  sell  me  some  at  100.00.” 

278 

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

In continuous  time  finance,  the  replicating  trade  would  need  to be  done 
in  infinitely  large  amounts  for  an  infinitely  small  difference  between 
strikes  to  properly  hedge  the  book.  But  markets  do  not  trade  continuously, 
be  it only  for  the  sake  of convention,  as  there  is  a set  minimum  price  incre- 
ment  called  the  “tick.”  Such  an  increment  is formal  on  exchanges  as  trading 
in  smaller  fractions  is disallowed  (see  Option  Wizard,  Dividing  a  Tick).  It is 
the  product  of  etiquette  and  convention  in  over-the-counter  markets,  as 
most  screens  and  systems  are  not  set  up  to  handle  any  number  smaller  than 
a  set  fraction.  Traders  in  some  markets  consider  it  downright  impolite  to 
display  a  price  in  too  precise  an  increment  (more  than  1/100). 

Definition  of the  Bet:  Forward  and  Spot  Bets 

It is  important  to  see  if the  bet  contract  defines  satisfaction  as  “higher”  or 
“at least”  the  bet  strike  price,  which,  in mathematical  symbol,  is  >  or  =.  The 
difference  is  minor  but  affects  our  replication.  If the  bet  terms  specify  “I 
pay  if the  asset  is 100  or  higher”  then  the  call  spread  needs  to  be  defined  as 
long  99.99  short  100.  If the  bet  says  “higher  than  100”  then  the  replication 
would  necessitate  the  long  100  short  100.01. 

Another  important  feature  concerns  the  timing  of payment.  Some  bets, 
particularly  when  they  are  out  of the  money,  are  sold  as  options  where  the 
“buyer”  pays  some  premium  immediately  and  gets  some  payment  if  the 
asset  satisfies  the  bet  at  expiration.  Others  are  denominated  as  a  bet  where 
the  party  that  loses  pays  the  money.  The  only  difference  between  the  two 
lies  in  the  discounting  of the  premium. 

m@  A spot  bet  is where  one  of the  parties  outlays  the  premium  initially  and 

would  receive  payment  if the  conditions  of the  bet  are  satisfied. 

A  forward  bet  is  one  where  the  parties  agree  to  exchange  payments  at  the 
end.  Thus,  the  party  paying  the  initial  premium  would  be  considered  the 
“buyer,”  arbitrarily.  The  following  are  examples: 

e  A bet  where  one  of the  parties  pays  $50  if the  spot  is higher  than  100 
on  the  Friday  after  Thanksgiving  and  would  receive  $50  is a  forward 
bet. 

e  A bet  on  the  outcome  of a  tennis  game  is typically  a  forward  bet. 
e  A note  that  may  pay  6%  interest  if Mexico  stays  above  a range  and  5% 
otherwise  is  a  spot  bet.  The  owner  of the  note,  through  the  reduced 
coupon,  is paying  in advance  for  the  bet. 

e  A  contract  where  one  pays  10  cents  and  may  receive  $1  if  the  fed 

eases  on  the  next  meeting  is a  spot bet. 

Binary  Options:  European  Style 

279 

So  there  is no  trick  worthy  of analysis  other  than: 

e  The  forward  bet  is forward  valued. 

e  The  spot bet  has  one  leg present  valued  (the initial  payment)  and  one 

leg forward  valued  (the  payment  received). 

This  book  tries  to  minimize  dwelling  on  simple  interest  rate  arithmetic.  So 
the  reader  should  assume  that  interest  rates  are  zero  (for a  while)  and  get on 
with  bigger  and  better  things. 

By  convention,  a  call  bet  is  the  term  used  for  the  agreement  where  a 
party  is betting  that  the  price  will  be  higher  than  the  strike  on  expiration 
date.  A call  bet  for  one  party  is a  put bet  for  another. 

By convention  also,  the  bet  is quoted  in  percentage  of the  total  at  stake. 
If the  final  payment  is  $1  then  the  bet  priced  at  25  cents  corresponds  to  a 
spot  or  forward  expenditure  of 25  cents.  If the  bet  payment  is  $500,  then  it 
becomes  $125. 

PRICING  WITH  THE  SKEW 

Assuming  replication  is  important  to  probe  the  structure  of an  option  and 
get a  feel  for  its  theoretical  value.  Replicating,  however,  is rather  impractical 
if one  takes  into  account  the  slightest  amount  of transaction  costs.  This  au- 
thor  has  never  seen  anyone  replicate  a  binary  option  with  narrow  spreads. 

As  the  skew  exists  in  most  markets  and  since  the  binary  is sensitive  to 
the  skew,  proper  allowance  should  be  made  in  the  pricing.  If the  minimum 
tick  size  is  .01,  the  option  will  be  sensitive  to  the  difference  in  skew  be- 
tween  the  100  and  the  100.01.  This  is  not  a  joke:  If there  is  a  microscopic 
skew  volatility  difference  between  the  strikes  owing  to  the  large  amounts 
involved  on  the  spread,  such  skew  will  bear  a  meaningful  effect  on  its  theo- 
retical  value. 

The  way  to  price  the  skew  effect  is to  look  at the  wider  replicating  portfo- 
lio and  the  amounts  involved.  Assume  that  there  is a  difference  of .5 volatility 
points  between  the  99.5  and  the  100.5  strikes  of the  same  maturity  as  the  bi- 
nary.  The  skew  effect  on  the  structure  should  be  equal  to  the  dollar  effect  of 
the  skew  on  the  replicating  portfolio.  It is computed  as  follows: 

Assume  that  the  trader  has  a  3-month  bet  paying  $100  if the  market  is 
higher  than  100  (for  simplicity,  assume  that  interest  rates  are  nil  and  that 
volatility  is  15.7).  The  Black-Scholes-Merton  value  is 49.6.  The  99.50/100.50 
replicating  spread  will  be  approximately  100  times  the  bet  if, in  this  make- 
believe  schematic  world,  the  market  moves  in  very  large  increments  of  1 
point.  This  assumption  is necessary  to  eliminate  the  possibility  of the  mar- 
ket  settling  between  99.50  and  100.50,  in which  case  the  replicating  portfolio 

280 

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

would  not  match  the  binary  option.  Taking  the  Black-Scholes-Merton  values 
of  the  call  spread,  the  value  of  the  bet  should  be  clase  to  49.6  (this  discus- 
sion  will  not  get into  the  notion  of the  small  risk-neutral  difference  between 
the  values  of both  instruments).  So  in  this  world  of only  one-dollar  moves, 
the  trader  appears  to  be  hedged. 

But  there  is  the  skew  in  the  market,  as  can  be  seen  in  an  exaggerated 

example: 

Assume  that  the  call  spread  trades  for  .69  because  the  99.5  call  trades 
one  volatility  point  higher  than  the  100.50.  This  means  that  the  binary  op- 
tion  needs  to  be more  expensive,  and  must  trade  at  $69  (as opposed  to  $49.6 
using  Black-Scholes-Merteon)  to  make  up  for  the  skew.  Would  anyone  bet  so 
much  that  the  spot  would  be  higher  on  expiration?  The  numbers  show  how 
exaggerated  the  skew  effect  can  be  on  the  barrier. 

Now  the  conflict:  A bet  trades  at  the  probability  of the  asset  price  end- 
ing  up  higher  than  the  bet  level.  The  difference  between  the  delta  and  the 
bet  will  be  explained  later;  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  skew—any 
skew—makes  the  two  elements  diverge.  That  divergence  will  lead  to  the 
more  complicated  notion  of the  skew  paradox. 

In practice,  however,  the  skew  would  not  be  as  pronounced  as  in the  pre- 
ceding  example  except  perhaps  in  biased  assets  or  SPT00  options  after  an 
anxiety  attack.  The  normal  skew  ranges  (in well-behaved  assets)  between  .5 
and 3 volatility  points  for  the  difference  between  a  .25  delta  call  and  .25 
delta  put  (i.e.,  between  a  75  delta  call  and  a  25  delta  call).  Interpolating  a  2- 
point  skew,  a  3-month  option  shows  about  .12  skew  at  15.7  volatility  for  the 
difference  between  99.5  and  100.5  (since  the  difference  is  .06  deltas  and  .5 
deltas  command a 2-point  skew).  The  price  effect  of  the  .12  skew  is  .025  on 

Option  Wizard:  The  Replication  Map 

Two  path-independent  trades  should  be  equal  in  price  if they  present  the  same 
payoff  everywhere  on  the  map  of possible  prices  (by the  rule  of stochatic  dom- 
inance). 

Path-independent  means  that  they  could  be  treated  by  looking  at  expira- 
tion  only.  That  statement  was  qualified  earlier  with  the  explanation  that  path- 
independent  options  become  path  dependent  when  hedged  dynamically.  The 
present  case  involves  static,  not  dynamic,  hedges. 

Replicating  a  binary  with  a  call  spread  makes  it necessary  to  look  at  /imit- 
ing cases.  The  call  spread  will  work  outside  the  strikes,  but  not  inside.  The  nar- 
rower  the  call  spread,  therefore,  the  most  perfect  the  replication. 

The  call  spread,  as  a  limit  decomposition  of  the  binary,  will  always  be 

higher  in  price,  by a  small  amount  that  vanishes  as  the  increments  narrow.

the  call  spread,  making  the  difference  between  strikes  .524  instead  of .49.  So 
through  the  replicating  portfolio,  the  price  of  the  bet  is  found  to  be  worth 
approximately  $52.4  instead  of  $49.6.  This  is  still  meaningful  enough  to 
alert  traders  about  potential  mispricing. 

Verification: 
Widening  the  increments  to  cover  a  spread  that  would  be 
50  deltas  apart  (i.e.,  the  one  quoted  by equivalence  with  the  25  delta  risk 
reversal)  would  reveal  the  following  strikes:  95.70  and  105.4  that  is  9.7 
points  apart.  It would  then  be  necessary  to  execute  9.52  spreads  on  the 
hedge  to  make  $100  if the  bet  is  satisfied  (if the  market  settled  above 
105.4)  and  lose  the  premium  paid  for  the  spread  if the  market  settles 
below  95.70.  Priced  on  the  skew,  the  value  of  the  vanilla  call  spread 
would  be  $52.30,  whereas  the  same  one,  Black-Scholes-Merton-priced 
(using  the  same  volatility  on  both  legs),  would  yield  $49,  similar  to  the 
fair  value  of the  bet  without  the  skew. 

A Formal  Pricing  on  the  Skew 

_ Seaitvely the  price  of the  binary  can  be  defined  as  the  risk-neutral  proba- 
bility  (i.e.,  taking  the  mean  of the  asset  returns  out  of the  equation  thanks 
to  delta  neutrality)  of ending  up  in the  money) If one  takes  the  earlier  argu- 
ment  of the  perfect  replication  through  the  call  spread,  the  following  equa- 
tion  results,  using  the  call  price  C, the  strike  price  of the  binary  K, and  h the 
difference  between  the  strikes  of the  replicating  call  spread: 

Binary  call  =  lim  oe  2 ec)  when  hh  >  0 

Thus  it resembles  the  derivative  of the  call  with  respect  to  the  strike.! 

Furthermore,  if the  trader  determined  that  the  volatility  of the  call  was 
of the  he would  therefore  create  a  skew  function  and  establish 

a  function 
‘a pricing  mechanism. 

ing  the  skew  as  a  function  of  K,  that  is  o(K),  and  the  skew  slope  at 
point  K the  derivative of the volatility  with respect to the  strike  as  shown  in 
Figure  17.5,  The  bet  value  becomes  5C/8K  +  5C/do  X  80/8K  =  Bet  (no 
skew)  +  vega of the  vanilla  call  of the  same  strike  X  “skew  slope.”* 

Example: 
Spot  trades  at  100.  Zero  interest  rates  are  assumed,  for  peda- 
gogical  reasons.  Consider  the  3-month  100  bet  call.  The  skew  for  a 
3-month  maturity  increases  by  .5  volatility  between  99.50  and  100.50; 
the  skew  slope  would  then  be  .5/1  =  .5.  The  vega  of  the  at-the-money 
call  for

therefore  .496  (the  Black-Scholes-Merton  value  at  15.7%  volatility)  +  .19

The  Skew  Paradox

Qyz:  The  reader  is told  that  a market  went  up  on  any  day  only  by steps  of 
81 and  went  down  by steps  of $9, with  no  other  possible  price  change.  Such 
process  is  shown  in  Figure  17.6.  Out  of  10  steps,  9 willbe  up  and  1 down. 
What  would  be the  reader  pay  for  a  one-day  at-the-money  call  bet  paying  $1 
if the  market  closes  tomorrow  higher  than  the  present  level? 

he  answer  is  $.90  The  key  is  that  the  bet  does  not  depend  on  the  ex- 
pected  return  but  on  the  expected  number  of  times  the  spot  would  be 
higher.  That  the  market  drops  in large  amounts  is irrelevant.  The  payoff  of a 
bet  option  is the  same  whether  the  market  drops  by $1 or  by $50. 

Either  by put-call  parity  rules  or  by use  of the  same  argument,  one  ar- 
rives  at a  value  of .1 for  the  put.  This  is an  intuitive  explanation  for the  skew. 
It also  shows  the  difference  between  the  bet  and  the  delta:  The  delta,  unlike 
the bet, is concerned  with  the  magnitude  of the  moves  since  the  trader  needs 
to be  protected  for  such  eventuality. 

raphically,  it could  be represented  as  shown  in Figure  17.7.  The  area  A

neutral  drift,  which  results  in a  mean  of the  risk-neutral  drift,  m.

‘Option  Wizard.  (Advanced):  The  Dirac  Delta 

The  Dirac  delta  is commonly  used  for the  impulse  function.  It could  be  easy  for 
traders  to  visualize  the  behavior  of volatility  at  one  point  in  time  surrounding  a 
special  announcement.  The  daily  volatility  could  still  remain  at,  say,  16%  but 
the  forward-forward  volatility  for  that  second  would  be  immensely  high  (in  the 
hundreds  or  thousands),  which  would  make  it very  difficult  to  measure. 

The  delta  function  can  be  simplified  as  follows:  Take  e,  a  small  number,  the 
smallest  possible  unit  that  can  be  imagined.  Then  the  rectangle  defined  by the 
sides  1/e and  e would  have  an  area  of 1 while  all  the  areas  surrounding  it would 
have  a  measure  of 0. 

A simplified  definition:  8()  =  1/e for  0 <  t<  e  and  &(t)  =  0 elsewhere.

The  Dirac  delta  is often  used  for  the  gamma  at  expiration:  The  cumulative 
gamma  would  be  the  delta,  but  it  is  seemingly  very  large  at  the  very  narrowly 
defined  expiration  instant.  It also  applies  to  the  delta  of a  binary  option  close 
to  extinction. 

is  needed  to  compensate  for  the  difference  between  the  payoff  to  the  right 
and  the  payoff  to  the  left.  The  value  of the  bet  will  therefore  drop. 

The  delta  is  there  to  account  for  both  the  possible  payoffs  and  their  | 

quency  while  the  binary  option  only  accounts  for  the  frequency. 

A feature  of the  two-currency  paradox  is that  the 
Mathematical  Note: 
delta  for  one  party  is the  binary  of the  other  and  vice  versa.  This  is due 
to  the  Jensen’s  inequality:  The  expectation  of  « (the  inverted  price)  is 
not  the  inverse  of the  expectation  of x,  as  discussed  in  Module  C.  Also, 
is equal  to  the  price  of th 
for  one  particular  strike,  the 

286 

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

call  and  vice  versa.  This  can  lead  to  the  binary  paradox—an  in- 

binary 
credible  situation: 
e  A bet  in dollars  for  a  dollar-based  person  on  USD-DEM  is different  in 
price  from  the  translation  into  German  marks  of  a  bet  in  German 
marks  on  USD-DEM  of the  same  strike  and  expiration.  Such  a  differ- 
ence  will  increase  through  both  time  to  expiration  and  an  increase  in 
volatility. 

e  The  reason  is straightforward:  Define  N(d2)  as  the  price  of a  bet  for  a 
dollar-based  person.  N(d1)  will  be  the  price  of the  bet  for  the  person 
based  in DEM,  by the  numeraire  inversion. 

¢  The  extension  of  the  paradox  is a little  unsettling:  Two  positions  on 
two  different  continents  cannot  be  marked  at  the  same  price.  Fur- 
thermore,  two  traders  performing  a  trade  on  opposite  sides  of  the 
fence  would  thus  both  show a profit  or  a  loss  on  the  same  leg. 

First  Hedging  Consequences 

e  Bets  need  to  be  priced  with  the  skew  of  the  market  taken  into  ac- 

count  using  the  preceding  method. 

. 

e  The  trader  should  not  be deceived  by the apparent  lack  of gamma  and 

vegas  at  the  origin. 

e  The  best  replication  for  a  digital  is a  wide  risk  reversal  (that  would  in- 
clude  any  protection  against  skew).  There  will  be  a  trade-off  between 
transaction  costs  and  optimal  hedges.  The  trader  needs  to  shrink  the 
difference  between  the  strikes  as  time  progresses  until  expiration,  at a 
gradual  pace.  As  such  an  optimal  approach  consumes  transaction 
costs,  there  is a  need  for  infrequent  hedging. 

¢  When  the  bet  option  is  away  from  expiration,  the  real  risks  are  the 
skew.  As  it nears  expiration,  the  risks  transfer  to  the  pin.  In practice, 
the  skew  is hedgeable,  the  pin is not. 

The  Delta  Is  a  Dirac  Delta 

(As shown  in Figure  17.9,  the  delta  for  a  bet  looks  similar  to  the  gamma  of a 
regular  option.  In addition,  it will  behave  and  “bleed”  like  the  gamma  of an 
option.)This  is because  a  delta  is almost  a  bet  (in the  risk-neutral  universe, 
to  be correct).  The  delta  of the  bet  will  therefore  be  the  gamma. 

A familiarity  with  the  Dirac  delta  function  is helpful  in  understanding 
the  way  the  delta  moves.  The  Dirac  delta  is an  interesting  function  that  has 
zero  value  everywhere  except  for  one  point,  but  with  the  integral  over  the 
map  equal  to  1. Likewise  the  delta  at  expiration  is zero  everywhere,  but  the 
integral  of the  delta  over  the  possible  moves  will  equal  the  bet’s  face  value.

Asset  Price 

The  gamma  of a  vanilla  option  follows  a  Dirac  delta  on  expiration  second; 
however,  few  traders  take  expiration  gamma  seriously,  because  it is  only  the 
derivative  of the  exposure.  With  binary  options,  however,  the  awkward  delta 
is of some  concern  because  many  traders  hedge  it with  cash  when  the  market 
is liquid  enough  for  them  to  do  so. 

A  delta  can  be  viewed  as  the  quantity  that  is  necessary  to  purchase  to 
break  even  over  a  certain  move  by the  cash.  Because  the  trader  knows  how 
much  money  he needs  to  make  over  one  particular  move,  the  notion  becomes 
almost  trivial.  However,  in  coming  closer  and  closer  to  expiration,  the  quan- 
tity  that  needs  to  be  purchased  will  be  close  to  nil  in  areas  that  do  not  cross 
the  “strike”  of the  bet.  The  delta  for  the  bet,  however,  will  become  close  to  in- 
finite  in  one  very  narrow  point  close  to  the  strike  point.  In  practice,  the  ex- 
ample  of the  perfect  replication  holds:  If the  market  were  allowed  to  move  by 
only  one-tick  increments,  between  say  100.00  and  100.01,  then  the  delta  be- 
tween  100.00  and  100.01  would  be  100  times  the  bet  payout  size  (if the  trade  is 
of  the  at  least  variety;  otherwise  the  trader  would  have  to  hedge  between 
99.99  and  100.00).  A trader  betting  $100  would  have  to  get a  position  of a  face 
value  of 100/.01  =  $10,000  to  satisfy  his  risk. 

Figure  17.9  shows  how  the  delta  concentrates  around  the  strike  as  the 
option  nears  expiration.  Figure  17.10  show  the  “step  function”  of  the  bet 
price  very  close  to  expiration  time.  Figure  17.11  show  the  Dirac  delta,  the 
derivative  of the  function  shown  in  Figure  17.10.

CONCLUSION:  STATISTICAL  TRADING  VERSUS 
DyYNAmiIc  HEDGING 

In  summary,  we  deemed  that  it was  extremely  difficult  to  hedge  a  binary 
with  an  option  that  has  a  continuous  payoff  owing  to  the  onerous  trans- 
action  costs.  Even  where  there  are  minimum  tick  increments,  a  static  hedge 
exists  that  perfectly  matches  a  binary  payout  but  is impractical  and  impos- 
sible  to execute.  So it is best  to  leave  the  hedging  to  structures  that  are  likely 
to  bite,  especially  as  they  come  closer  to  expiration. 

Hedging  the  bet  with  deltas  only  would  be  easier  and  sometimes  the 
variance  of  the  P/L  could  be  reduced,  but  by no  means  could  it be  elimi- 
nated.  In some  cases,  it might  be increased.  However,  it is easy  to be  “shoot- 
ing”  the  delta,  that  is  overhedging  it,  in  zones  where  the  trader  would  be 
exposed  to  losses  beyond  his  risk  appetite.  So if the  102  bet  causes  him  some 
headaches,  he  could  buy more  deltas  at  101  and  take  the  risks  of having  the 
market  drop  back  down.  Buying  way  ahead  of the  barrier  would  then  give 
him  some  extra  P/L  at 102  that  could  be spent  in transaction  costs  whipping 
around  the  bet  strike.  “Shooting”  deltas  neither  increases  nor  decreases  the 
total  return.  It only  smoothes  the  P/L  around  the  barrier  at  the  expense  of 
slightly  worsening  it away  from  it. 

Banks  are  sometimes  best  left  to  run  some  of the  binary  options  like  bets, 
much  as  insurance  companies  can  live  with  a  certain  amount  of local  risk  that

is possible  to  diversify  away.  The  good news  about binary 
worst-case  scenarios  are  bounded  and  sversiiabe, Eat vega vanishes as 
they become  close  to  the  money  presenting  a  meaningful  protection.  A hitch 
is  that  in  such  cases,  because  of the  absence  of delta  neutrality,  traders  need 
to  value  the  bets  using  their  own  subjective  distribution,  not  the  risk-neutral 
one.  Figure  17.14  shows  the  different  hedging  and  valuation  policies  available 
to  institutions.

Many  of the  nonfinancial  bets,  like  bets  on  political  events,  are  of a  bi- 
nary  nature  and  leave  no  choice:  They  do not  lend  themselves  to  continuous 
hedging.  Many  banks  issue  notes  with  a  payoff  linked  to  a  political  event  or 
the  determination  of  federal  reserve  policy  (e.g.,  a note  that  bets  on  a  dis- 
count  rate  cut).  Precisely  because  binary  options  have  a  discontinuous  pay- 
off,  they can  be  easily  adapted  to  such  nonfinancial  and  nontradable  bets. 

So  the  trader  can  assume  the  pin risk  when  the  amounts  at  stake  are  not 
life-threatening.  The  object  is to have  enough  of them  to become  “statistical,” 
that  is, let  the  variance  be  dominated  by the  number  of bets.  Otherwise,  the 
trader  should  be less  statistical  and  more  replicating. 

CASE  STUDY  IN  BINARY  PACKAGES— 
CONTINGENT  PREMIUM  OPTIONS 

This  combination  is being  covered  despite  being  a  simple  construction  to  il- 
lustrate  the  use  of binary  options  in packages. 

Binary  Options:  European  Style 

291 

Chere premium  options  are  vanilla  options  where  the  option 
buyer  only  pays  the  price  of  the  option  in  the  event  of  it being  in  the 
money. 

These  options  can  thus  be  constructed  with  simple  options  plus  a  forward 
bet  for  the  premium  amount. 

This  sounds  pretty  much  like  a  free  lunch  except  for  the  hitch:  It creates 
an  area  of negative  profitability  around  the  strike  as  shown  in  Figure  17.15. 
The  owner  of the  option  will  still  have  to  pay  the  premium  of his  option  if it 
is slightly  in  the  money,  and  such  amount  is, if the  option  is initially  at  the 
money,  twice  what  he  would  have  paid  for  a  regular  option.  In  other  words, 
the  only way  to  lose  money  on  such a trade  is to  be  slightly  right. 

Mechanically,  it is generally  composed  of a  regular  option  plus a  binary 

where  the  face  value  of the  bet  corresponds  to  the  initial  premium. 

Recommended  Use:  Potential  Devaluations 

A generally  good  use  of a  contingent  premium  option  is in distributional  ar- 
bitrage.  The  trader  can  have  the  contingent  option  struck  at  a  price  where  he 
believes  there  is a  reflecting  barrier,  like  a  currency  band,  or  an  officially  de- 
fended  limit  to  the  move  of an  asset.  The  idea  is  that,  should  the  price  break 
through  such a level,  the  market  will  no  longer  be  supported  by the  authori- 
ties  and  a  devaluation  will  cause  the  option  to be clearly  in the  money. 

Figure  17.16  shows  a  market  mapping  through  an  intervention  level 

with  a  vengeance. 

Another  interesting  use  is  with  strongly  biased  assets  where  down 
moves  are  rare  but  accentuated.  The  trader  can  structure  a  position  to

benefit  if  the  market  precipitously  falls  with  an  at-the-money  contingent 
premium  put. 

A  final  use  for  such  structure  is  in  markets  with  the  “fat  tails”  where 
moves  in  either  direction  are  accentuated,  making  intermediate  moves 
quite  rare. 

Case  Stupy:  THE  BETSPREADS 

Betspreads  are  simple  binary  call  or  put  spreads.  There  is  no  mystery  to 
them  as  they‘are  obtained  by construction. @  betspread  is  a  structure  that 
collects  a  certain  amount  if  the  share  price  €rids  up  between  strike  1  and 
strike  2 and  collects  nothing  elsewhere: 

From  a  trading  standpoint,  ee  butterflies  and  condors  (a 
butterfly  with  4 strikes)  in  the  sense  that  if  a  binary  bet  resembles  a  call 
spread,  a  betspread  resembles  a  condor. 

While  this  book  is  not  concerned  with  single  strategies,  betspreads 
merit  some  attention.  The  study  of  betspreads  can  enlighten  the  trader  in 
the  management  of a  pure  binary  options  book.  Because  a  binary  option  is 
by 
rever- 
sal.  This  is encouraging  as  the  position  risk  can  be shifted  down  by one  mo- 
ment  of the  distribution,  as  shown  in  the  following  analysis. 

ion_a  risk  reversal_a  betspread  is  therefore  a 

risk 

double 

A  six-month  betspread  paying  $1  if the  asset  ends  up  between  100  and 

105  would  look  as  depicted  in  Figure  17.17. 

ith  time,  the  price  of  the  betspread  would  naturally  converge  to  the 
fal  payoff,  and  the  risk  would  become  topical.  Figures  17.18  and  17.19  il- 
ustrate  the  effect  of the  passage  of time  on  the  price  of the  structure. 

From  that,  it becomes  easy  to  conclude  that  perhaps  the  best  hedge  for  a 

binary  option  is a  similar  binary  option. 

Examine  the  gammas.  Figure  17.20  shows  the  gamma  of  a  betspread. 
Compare  it with  Figure  17.12  (gamma  of a  bet).  The  risk  reversal  (third  mo- 
ment)  aspect  seems  to  be replaced  by a fifth  moment  instability,  which  is, in 
this  case,  preferable.

Advanced  Case  Study:  Multiasset  Bets 

A  bet  that  pays  if either  of  the  two  commodities  ends  up  higher  or  lower 
than  a  certain  level  at  expiration  is called  a  multiasset  bet. 

The  reader  can,  as  an  exercise,  study  the  exposure  to  the  correlation  of a 
structure  that  presents  two  bets,  of the  either-or  variety,  using  the  preced- 
ing methodology  and  that  presented  in Chapter  22.  To price  it intuitively,  he 
can  imagine  the  value  of the  limit  decomposition  of a  rainbow  call  spread.

Binary  Options:  American  Style 

Adam  K.,  one  of the  greatest  option  traders  of all  times  (and  one  of the fastest 
minds  the  author  ever  met)  called  the  author  with  the following  request: 

“I hear  you  are  giving  a  4-day  seminar  on  hedging  exotic  options.  Can  you 
give  it to  me  during  lunch  time  tomorrow?  All  I need  is  the  beef.  You  see,  I don’t 
have  patience for details.” 

AMERICAN  SINGLE  BINARY  OPTIONS 

American  binary  (or  digital)  option  is  a  common  bet  option  with  the 
difference  that  it  pays  when  the  price  is  “touched”  rather  than  if  the 
price  settles  above  or  below a certain  price. 

As  defined,  the  American  binary  is path  dependent  (Figure  18.1).  A  trader 
cannot  go  on  an  extended  trekking  vacation  and  come  back  on  expiration 
day to  satisfy  the  bet  obligation.  The  bet  can  thus  reach  expiration  any  time 
oS 

The  first  noticeable  difference  between  the  American  and  the  European 
bet  is  the  price.  Because  the  option  has  at  least  equal  chances  of  being 
knocked  out,  it is  therefore  a  larger  outlay  than  the  European  one  for  the 
“buyer”  at  all  times  (generally  twice).'  The  buyer  is  defined  as  the  person 
who  receives  the  payment  if  the  price  is  touched.  The  American  bet  will 
thus  be more  expensive  with  the  consequence  that  the  risk  of the  lack  of sat- 
isfaction  for  the  seller  will  be  much  larger. 

Option  Wizard:  The  Contamination  Principle  and  Barrier  Options 

If there  is  a  point,  namely  the  barrier,  that  can  create  some  positive  P/L  (the 
termination  of the  bet  is positive  for  the  buyer),  then  the  position  will  be  long 
gamma  in  smoothly  decreasing  amounts  in  areas  surrounding  it.  It will  there- 
fore  be  long  vega  from  that  position. 

If, for  reasons  of carry  (see  Girsanov),  the  bet  termination  results  in  nega- 
tive  P/L,  then,  again  the  areas  close  to  such  point  will  carry  a  negative  gamma.

Spot  trades  at  100.  Assume  volatility  at 15.7%.  A  European 
Example: 
bet  that  spot will  be higher  than  105  at  expiration  100  days hence  will  be 
worth  26%  of the  face  value.  An  American  bet  will  be  worth  51%  of the 
face  value  of the  payoff. 

Another  difference  is that  because,  unlike  the  European,  it is not  possi- 
ble  to  cross  the  fence  (i.e.,  move  “in”  the  money),  the  American  bet  will  al- 
ways  be  long  volatility  for  the  seller.  Intuitively,  it  is  easier  to  sense  that, 
unlike  another  structure,  the  movement  would  benefit  the  seller  if it takes 
the  option  closer  to  the  money.  If  movement  one  way  can  translate  into 
higher  profits,  by the  contamination  principle  the  movement  should  help  in 
the  other  direction. 

It  was  established  in  Chapter  17  that  the  European  binary  is  a  risk 
reversal.  The  American  binary  is  generally  monotonic  in  gamma,  though 
not  always  (Figure  18.2). 

With  no  drift  (forward  trades  at  flat  with 
Risk  Management  Rule: 
cash),  the  American  binary  never  changes  in  the  sign  of  the  vegas 
and  gammas:  It remains  a  pocket  of localized  long vega. 

The  issue  of interest  rates  will  be  tackled  in Chapters  19  and  20.  A posi- 
tive  curve  can  lead  to negative  gamma  near  the bet price  for  an  American  bi- 
nary  and  positive  gamma  away  from  it.  The  rule  is as  follows: 

Binary  Options:  American  Style 

297 

Sk  Management  Rule: 

The  American  binary  will  be  positive 
amma  everywhere  (for the  “owner,”  the  person  who  earns  the  pay- 
off when  the  barrier  is hit)  when  the  delta  hedge  against  the  option 
incurs  a  negative  carry. 

or  a  definition  of negative  carry  in  an  asset,  traders  can  easily  use  the  fol- 
lowing  rule:  forward  price  for  the  period  ¢t +  1 is  higher  than  the  forward 
price  for  period t¢ (the  spot). 

isk  Management  Rule: 

The  profile  of  the  American  binary  will 
look  like  that  of a  risk  reversal  (i-e.,  a third  position  moment  differ- 
ent  from  0) if the  delta  hedge  of the  owner  earns a positive  carry  su- 
perior  to  the  time  decay  of  the  same  binary  on  the  same  asset 
without  drift. 

A  peculiar  aspect  of  the  American  binary  that  leads  to  the  notion  of 
stopping  time  is  that  the  distribution  of the  expected  time  to  extinction  is 
what  matters.  In  a  way,  an

Hedging  an  American  Binary:  Fooled  by the  Greeks 

This  section  provides  a  simplified  tutorial  for  the  management  of the  vega 
risk  of any  nonvanilla  structure  with  a  concave  vega. 

Case  Study:  National  Vega  Bank 

This  case  study  describes  the  attempt  to  hedge  the  following  option:  a  105 
“if  touched”  bet  paying  $1  on  termination  per  unit.  The  trader  at  National 
Vega  Bank  becomes,  due  to an  ugly structure  that  is otherwise  stripped  and 
hedged,  long  the  105  American  bet  in  $10,000,000.  Spot  is  at  100  and,  as 
usual,  the  forward  trades  at  flat.  Volatility,  as  in  most  examples,  is  at  15.7% 
which  corresponds  to  1%  a  day  move  252  days  a  year.  The  bet  expires  ex- 
actly  100  days  from  now.  “Fair”  value  (better  called  unfair  value)  is 54.7% 
(i.e.,  $5,470,000).

By  “buying,”  the  trader  has  a  similar  position  as  being  long a call- 
spread,  which  is long delta.  In  addition,  as  he  is betting  on  the  spot  moving, 
he will  be long volatility. 

The  first  thing  that  comes  to  mind  is the  delta.  The  trader  will  hedge  it 
by  selling  the  equivalent  of  8%  of  the  face  value  of  the  security,  namely 
$800,000. 

Table  18.1  and  Figure  18.3  show  the  resulting  three  legs  of  the  trade: 
The  P/L  for  the  binary,  that  from  the  delta,  and  the  final  net.  As  can  be 
seen  in  Figure  18.3,  the  position  is  mildly  long  gamma.  However,  the 
gamma  disappears  beyond  the  barrier.  In  addition,  the  trader  would  need 
to  rapidly  unwind  his  position.  As  shown  in  Figure  18.3  and  discussed  in 
the  Option  Wizard,  The  Gap  Delta,  there  is  a  discontinued  payoff.  Should 
the  trader  avoid  catching  the  market  on  time,  the  hedge  would  be  off  by a 
slippage  factor.

Option  Wizard:  The  Gap  Delta  (1) 

he gap  delta_is  the  difference  in  deltas  near  a  particular  barrier.  The  trader 
needs  to  unwind  a  certain  amount  of deltas  that  were  used  to  hedge a barrier 
structure  by dumping  that  amount  in  the  market  at  a  given  price. 

The  trader  has  no  guarantee  of getting  the  exact  target  price,  owing  to  liq- 
uidity  matters.  Trying  to  execute  ahead  of the  barrier  is equally  dangerous  as  it 
raises  the  dangers  of  the  “fake  trigger,”  a  situation  where  the  market  trades 
near  the  barrier  then  pulls  back  without  hitting  it. 

ee difference  between  the  price  the  unwinding  was  executed  at  and  the 
arrier  is called  the  slippage  (as  defined  in Chapter  4).  Many  traders  get  negative 
surprises  as  markets  near  the  barrier.  Illiquid  markets  can  be  vicious  as  they  un- 
dergo  liquidity  holes  (as  defined  in  Chapter  4)  near  a  particular  barrier. 

The  gap  delta  receives  extensive  treatment  in  other  parts  of the  book,  as  it 

deserves  as  much  attention  as  possible.

The  P/L cannot 

between  two  different  dates  on  the  graph  on 
Figure  18.5.  It corresponds  to  the  recentering  of the  position  at  100  the  day 
of the  run.  The  P/L  lines  are  all  made  to  be  zero  at  100,  which  prevents  the 
user  from  comparing  two  dates,  but  allows  visualizing  the  P/L  within  one 
date.  Such  an  issue  of noncomparability  is explained  in  the  Option  Wizard,

ote.  It is assumed  that  the  trader  did  not  unwind  his  delta  in  the  mar- 
t after  the  barrier  is hit.  This  shows  the  precipitous  drop  in P/L  as  the  bi- 
nary,  being  terminated  ceases  to  accumulate  positive  P/L  while  the  delta 
continues  to  build  a  negative  P/L. 

From  Figure  18.5,  it is evident  that  the  delta  becomes  larger  close  to  the 
strike  next  to  expiration.  So  the  trader  needs  to  sell  the  asset  in  the  rally.

Option  Wizard:  Looking  at  a  Graph  through  Time 

Unlike  many  functions  that  one  can  easily  project  through  time,  an  option  po- 
sition  needs  to  be  analyzed  while  keeping  in  mind  that  markets  are  not  just 
frozen  between  periods  and  that  traders  are  not  stuffed  birds.  The  positions 
will  change  and  traders  react  accordingly. 

A  graph  representing  the  same  position  one  month  later  would  not  cor- 
rectly  forecast  the  P/L  as  it does  not  include  the  appropriate  adjustments  an 
option  position  continuously  undergoes. 

However,  the  following  takes  place:  These  deltas  present  as  many  potential 
problems  to  deal  with,  as  the  knocking-off  of the  binary  would  necessitate 
unwinding  larger  and  larger  amounts  of money.  The  trader  would  need  to 
buy back  what  he sold.  The  higher  the  delta,  the  more  he would  need  to  sell, 
the  more  he  would  have  to  buy  back.  From  whom?  Most  probably  from 
those  he  initially  sold  to. 

In  addition,  look  at  the  potential  danger:  What  if  the  binary  were  not 
knocked  off?  The  P/L  accumulated  on  the  buildup  of time  value  in  the  bi- 
nary  would  deflate  rapidly,  causing  considerable  time  decay. 

Ok  then  at  the  same  graph  without  recentering  it  (Figure  18.6).  It is 
Gece that  the  position  increases  in gamma  through  time  and,  conse- 
quently,  in  time  decay.  As  can  be  seen,  the  time  decay  becomes  a  serious 
matter  close  to  the  end.  The  P/L  should  be  interpreted  from  the  origin  of 
100  to  the  next  point.  It assumes  delta  hedging  at the  date  and  at the  price  of 
100  without  subsequent  hedging  until  the  barrier  is hit.  So  the  10-day  posi- 
tion  was  made  delta  neutral  on  the  delta  of the  tenth  day, considerably  lower

Another  piece  of information  can  be  gathered  from  the  same  graph  but

There  is a  subtle  difference  between  Figures  18.5  and  18.6.  In  the  previ- 
ous  one,  the  30-day  line  came  below  both  the  10-day  and  the  70-day,  owing 
to  the  delta  neutrality  at  100. 

Figure  18.7  provides  the  intuition  of the  true  risks.  The  longer  the  time 
to  expiration,  the  more  horizontal  the  slope  of  the  asset  price  to  the  option 
value,  the  lower  the  risks.  With  little  time  left  on  the  clock,  the  trade  is safe 
away from the strike and risky near it. Figure 18.8  shows  the  corresponding

Understanding  the  Vega  Convexity 

—— 

In  Figure  18.9  the  first  noticeable  effect  is that  the  difference  becomes  thin- 
ner  at  the  extremes.  While  every  option  trader  knows  than  an  option’s  vega 
diminishes  away  from  the  strike,  this  seems  to  be  quite  exaggerated.  In  ad- 
RG  eee  ORE at  the  barrier,

This effect is not trivial. It raises the problem  of how  to  hedge  the  vega 
of an  American  binary  option  with  instruments  that  do  not  vanish  at  the  bar- 
rier.  Many  attempts  at the  so-called  static  option  replication  have  been  inade 
without  much  success  at  finding  a  structure  that  can  imitate  the  payoff 
every  where  and  cancel  the  pin risk. 

The  notion  of vega  convexity  is best  demonstrated  by creating  a  portfo- 
lio  that  is  long  vega  through  the  binary  and  short  vega  with  other  instru- 
ments  in  the  market  that  present  a  linear  sensitivity  to  implied  volatility. 

First,  look  at  the  effect  of volatility  changes  on  one  structure,  as  shown 

in  Figure  18.10.

Sensitivity  of an  American  digital  to  volatility. 

e  reader  can  see  that  the  function  is concave.  Higher  volatility  causes 
the  price  to  increase,  but  at  a  decreasing  rate.)It  Means 
that should  the 
trader  go vega  neutral  against  the  structure,  he will  end  up  short  volatility 
of volatility,  or  to  use  a  different  language,  short  the  fourth  moment.  From  a 
trader’s  experience,  the  worst  moment  to be short  is the  fourth  moment  be- 
cause,  unlike  the  third  moment  (the  skew),  there  is generally  no  clear  com- 
pensation  for  the  risks  incurred.  The  prices  in  the  market,  using  constant 
volatility  models,  do  not  factor  such  exposure. 

Starting  at  15.7  volatility,  the  trader  decides to  hedge  the  vega  using  an 
instrument  of the  same  official  duration.  So  he  sells  enough  volatility  to  be 
“vega  neutral,”  that  is for  small  moves  in volatility. 

pabete 10 .F1 shows We vorabity concavity. This concavity  is mostly  due 
to  the  shortening  of the  first  exit  time  as  volatility  rises.  The  vega  sensitiv- 
ity  shrinks  as  the  trader  comes  near  the  trigger.  Such  concavity  would 
change  according  to  the  position  of the  market  relative  to  the  barrier/Figure

So  far,  the  following  risks  have  been  shown: 

Duration  Risks.  The  barrier  is  a  bet  on  duration.  Vanillas  do  not 
hedge  in a  shifting  volatility  curve  against  the  shifts,  lengthening,  and 
shortening  of the  structure.  So  much  for  static  option  replication.

Vega  hedges  need  to  take  into  account 
that the exposure  vanishes past  the  bet  price.  It means  that  whatever 
hedge  the  trader  performs  should  shrink  accordingly  past  that  level.) 
Good  luck  in finding  one. 

°/  Vega  Concavity  (for  the  owner). 

Whatever  structure  is  used  as  a 
hedge needs  fo  have a positive  fourth  moment  (i.e.,  long  volatility  of 
volatility)  to  be  able  to  offset  the  risks  of the  structure. 

These  risks,  inherent  to  the  American  binary,  are  present  in  some  shape  or 
. 
another  in  all barrier  options. 

Trading  Methods 

erican  binary  options  are  truly  options  on  time  rather  than  options  on  the 
instruments  that  are  simi- 
asset. As such,  they  can  only 
larly  options  on  time.  These  instruments  are  necessarily  other  barriers,  with 
similar  payoff,  at  some  trigger  point  not  too  far  removed  from  the  bet  itself.

Hedging  a  long position  in American  bets  with  European  vanilla  options 
is  a  true  losing  proposition,  except  in  cases  where  one  prices  the  fourth  mo- 
ment  risk  into  the  structure.  Hedging  them  with  binary  options  of the  Euro- 
pean  variety  creates  an  illusion  of  a  hedge:  The  European  bet  is  altogether 
another  instrument,  except  on  expiration  minute. 

The  greatest  danger  traders  face  in  their  activity  comes  from  the  reading 
of  the  risk  on  a  computer  sheet.  Vegas  stemming  from  a  European  vanilla

with  its  clear  and  well-defined  duration  are  more  reliable  than  those  arising 
from  the  American  binary  options  with  unknown  duration  and  unstable  mo- 
ments.  So  traders  who  navigate  with  the  Greeks  are  going  to  be  subjected  to 
serious  dangers.  “Non-Greek”  traders  (i.e.,  nonparametric  traders)  who  ab- 
sorb  as  much  information  about  their  strikes  fare  better.  That  is why it is best 
recommended  to  divorce  a  barrier  book  from  a  vanilla  position  to  better  see 
the  strikes  and  navigate  without  the  superficial  information  about  the  lower 
Greeks. 

Case  Study:  At-Settlement  American  Binary  Options 

Some  binary  options,  as  if the  American  binary  feature  was  not  deleterious 
enough,  present  the  additional  difficulty  of  a  conditional  feature.  Besides 
the  “if touched”  variety,  there  is the  “if settled”  type  that  makes  the  regular 
American  binary  seem  easy  to  trade  by comparison. 

nif  settled  binary  only pays  the  bet  value  if the  underlying  asset  offi- 
cyally  settles  through  the  trigger.  This  means  that  the  asset  price  needs  to 
settle  higher  than  the  trigger  if the  bet  is a  call  and  lower  than  the  trigger  if 
the  asset  is a  put. 

Ly traders  believe  that  such  a  feature  comes  into play on  the  last  day. 
ut  the  last  day for  an  American  binary  is going to be  every  possible  day. 

This  feature  acts  on  the  price  of the  binary  in a  strange  way:  It creates  a 
negative  gamma  hole  around  the  price  of the  barrier.  Earlier,  it was  seen  that 
the  important  feature  of an  American  binary  bet  is that  (except  for some  cases

the  position  could  re- 
‘main  only  on  one  side  of  the  barrier  and  could  not  cross  it  at  all  without 
termination,  which  would  make  the  vega  and  gamma  dimension  mute. 

to the  fact 

that 

An  American  if settled  binary  would  therefore  act  like  a European  binary 
during  the  day and  like  an  American  between  days  as  shown  in Figure  18.13. 
This  causes  serious  complications  with  the  unwinding  of the  gap  delta.

Example:  A 105  Call  if settled  American  bet  pays  $1 on  termination.  The 
trader  sells  deltas  against  the  position.  As  the  market  rallies,  he  would 
need  to  sell  more  to benefit  from  the  probability  of cashing  in on  the  bet. 
However,  he  would  have  to  buy  everything  back  if the  strike  is  crossed. 
Should  the  market  cross  the  gap  early  in  the  day,  the  uncertainty  would 
last  the  longest.  The  trader  has  no  way  of knowing  whether  he  would  re- 
main  in the  terminating  zone  or  if he would  cross  again  to  reenter  the  op- 
posite  area.  What  if  the  market  moved  back  down  and  settled  on  the 
“negative”  side  of  the  bet?  This  constitutes  a  negative  gamma  position 
around  the  barrier  that  vanishes  in  the  extremes,  high  above  or  low 
below,  as  depicted  in Figures  18.13  and  18.14. 

Other  Greeks 

Studying  the  behavior  of other  Greeks  such  as  the  rho  is generally  futile  be- 
cause  of the  instability  of the  measure.  Having  established  that  the  gamma 
was  unusual,  there  is no  need  to  go  into  secondary,  less  significant  Greeks. 

AMERICAN  DOUBLE  BINARY  OPTIONS 

An  American  double  bet  is a  bet  whose  condition  is satisfied  if the  mar- 
ket  touches  either  of two  levels  during  the  life  of the  option.  These  levels 
are  generally  called  high barrier  and  low  barrier.

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

One  feature  to  remember  about  the  American  double  bets  is that,  coun- 
terintuitively,  they will  trade  at a  very  narrow  discount  of the  bet  value  (it is 
usually  expressed  in  percentages;  a  bet  priced  at  96%  pays  100  for  every  96 
dollars  invested  in  it).  Prices  such  as  98%  or  99%  are  common  for  options 
that  are  a  few  weeks  away  with  barriers  straddling  the  market  by only 2 or  3 
daily  standard  deviations. 

An  interesting  feature  of American  bets  is how  short  their  expected  exit 
time  may  be.  A double  bet  trading  at  80%  of face  value  implies,  roughly,  as- 
suming  no  drift  and  no  interest  rates,  that  it has  about  20%  of the  nominal 
time  to  live. 

The  double  bet  feature  is  often  present  in  the  so-called  range  notes 
where  the  investor  is sold  financial  assets  and  notes  that  pay  their  coupons 
according  to  whether  the  market  remains  within  some  range  or  not.  In  that 
case,  the  assumption  is  that  the  coupon  is  the  face  value  of  the  bet.  Figure 
18.15  shows  the  profile  of the  double  binary  with  time. 

Vegas  of the  Double  Binary 

The  barrier  reacts  to  an  increase  in  volatility  by shortening  its  expected 
time  of  arrival.  This  presents  a  very  concave  way  of being  long  vega.  For 
that  reason,  even  hedging  by selling  other concave  vegas  (like  a  single  bar- 
rier)  might  not  be  sufficient.  The  instrument  trading  at  80  or  90  can  only 
reach  100  as  volatility  increases,  which  limits  its  vega  power.  The  concav- 
ity,  as  a  rule  of  thumb,  can  be  ascertained  from  the  following:  As  the 
amounts  to  possibly  lose  from  a  trade  become  considerably  higher  than

Table  18.2  shows  the  trade  of a  double  bet  at  16%  volatility  (Figures  18.16 
and  18.17)  and  an  attempt  to hedge  the  vega  exposure  with  a  linear  vega.  The 
amounts  are  expressed  per  unit  of a  1%  bet. 

Other  Applications  of American  Barriers 

Amortizing  Interest  Rate  Securities 

@  The  maturity,  coupon,  or  in  some  structures,  the  principal,  of amortiz- 
ing  interest  rate  securities,  varies  according  to  whether  some  prede- 
fined  rate  was  reached  in  the  market.  They  can  be  defined  in  any 
possible  manner  but  those  that  are  path  dependent  can  irreversibly  de- 
cline  in  coupon  payments  or  principal  if  some  interest  rate  level  is 
reached. 

As  such,  it is safe  to  assume  that  the  amortizing  swap  is  a  zero  coupon  in- 
strument  plus a  series  of forward  American  bets  on  every  coupon  payment, 
each  bet  being  a  specific  level  in  the  market.  This  assumption  requires  no 
special  feature  like  requirements  for  the  market  to  remain  under  some  level 
for  a  prolonged  period. 

They  can  be  forward  bets  because  each  bet  is timed  like  the  payment  of 
a  regular  coupon.  Again  every  structure  varies  from  pricing  purposes  but 
the  trading  intuition  remains  that  of  a sum  of American  bets. 

Amortizing  swaps  represent  another  situation  where  the  traders  were 
long American  digital  options  and  discovered  themselves  to  be long gamma 
until  the  barrier.  The  traders  sold  options  to  flatten  out  their  gamma  and 
rapidly  discovered  the  notions  of vega  convexity  and  that  of a  vanishing  leg 
of a  hedge.  As  these  securities  were  fashionable  for  a  brief  period,  the  build 
up  in  inventory  caused  a  few  spectacular  losses  when  the  dealers  rushed  to 
buy back  their  gamma.

Option  Wizard:  Too  Much  Hedging  Is Bad  for  You 

This  chapter  will  end  with  the  following  war  story:  An  aggressive  derivatives 
house  lost  a  considerable  amount  of money  on  a  trade  where  they  managed  to 
buy  “cheap”  volatility  with  a  series  of knock-out  options  using  rebates,  in  fact 
obtaining  a  strip  of American  binary  options.  They  had  a  considerable  “margin” 
in  the  trade,  which  means  that  the  trader  went  home  with  some  theoretical 
marks-to-market  profits  and  thought  highly  of himself. 

The  trader  was  asked  by his  boss  to  manage  the  risk  and  reduce  the  expo- 
sure.  “Cash-in  on  the  money,”  he  was  told.  This  was  a  reference  to  the  money 
they  believed  they  had  earned  off  the  customer.  So  the  trader  examined  the 
Greeks  and  sold  the  vega,  to  perfect  the  vega  neutrality  in a  manner  that  would 
befit  such  a  sophisticated  house  as  his. 

A  few  weeks  later,  the  trader  was  out  of  a  job.  Volatility  exploded  and  he 
lost  considerable  money  due  to  the  difference  in  convexity  between  the  vegas 
he  owned  and  the  vegas  he  so  massively  sold.  His  boss,  not  very  recipient 
about  notions  of  fourth  moments  and  other  nerdy  matters,  fired  him  on 
grounds  that  the  trader  did  not  properly  offset  the  exposure.  Actually,  the 
trader,  hedging  a  double  barrier  with  out-of-the-money  options,  was  even  short 
the  sixth  moment. 

The  trader,  like  most  derivatives  traders  who  lose  their  jobs,  landed  himself 
a  better  position  (he  had  gained  valuable  experience)  and  concluded  with  the 
following  wisdom:  Hedging  increases  your  risks. 

Risk  Management  Rule: 
tinuous  exposure  with  continuous  one. 

It is necessary  to  avoid  hedging  a  discon- 

Credit  Risk 

Assume  that  a  trader  buys  a  USD  denominated  Mongolian  government 
note.  As  the  note  will  trade  at  an  interest  rate  differential  with  the  default- 
free  USD  rate,  it is convenient  to  view  the  payment  differential  as  a  form  of 
forward  American  bet  on  the  default  by the  Mongolian  government.  Again, 
the  American  bet  is  a  general  framework:  One  could  estimate  that  the  face

Barrier  Options  (1) 

* 

A  true  trader  is a  human  being  endowed  with  the  rare  gift of a positively  sloping 
learning  curve. 

This  chapter  opens  with  a  discussion  of knock-in  and  knock-out  options  (of 
the  regular  variety  that  knock  in  or  out  when  they  are  out-of-the-money).' 
These  options  represent  the  simplest  forms  of barrier  trading  and  hedging. 
Reverse  barrier  options  will  be covered  in Chapter  20.  The  terminology  “re- 
verse”  indicates  the  unusual  nature  of the  transaction,  as  well  as  the  hedg- 
ing difficulties  incurred  in  its  management.(able  19.1  shows  the  different 
barrier  categories  and  rates  their  trading  complexity.)  , 

With  reverse  barriers,  the  payoff  at  the  barrier'is  significant.  The  trader 
needs  familiarity  and  experience  with  regular  knock-outs  before  muddling 
in  the  waters  of  reverse  barriers.  Prior  understanding  of American  binary 
options  is a  must. 

Rebates  will  be  covered  in  the  next  chapter,  as  those  make a barrier  op- 
tion  closer  to  an  American  binary.  The  next  chapter  will  also  discuss  double 
barriers  as  well  as  the  major  possible  variations  around  the  barrier  theme. 

Unless  otherwise  mentioned,  the  underlying  options  concerned  are 

European  style. 

BARRIER  OPTIONS  (REGULAR) 

(Regula barrier  options  include  calls  down  and  out,  puts  up  and  out,  calls 
in,  pufs  up  and  in.)This  section  is  required  to  understand  all

other  barrier  structures. 

Knock-Out  Options 

A knock-out  option  is a  regular  option  with  a  second  strike  price,  called 
“trigger,”  “outstrike,”  or  “barrier.”  The  option  is  considered  expired 
when  the  second  strike,  the  barrier,  is crossed. 

The  terminology  varies  (as  with  most  new  products),  Bet  (enue  cite

the  latter  is below  the  strike.  It will  be  above  the  current  spot  if the  latter  is 
out-of-the-money.  Otherwise,  the  option  is called  a  reverse  knock-out, Re- 
verse  knock-out  structures  are  more  difficult  to  trade  than  knock-outs  be- 
cause(the  option  vanishes  when  it holds  a  large  intrinsic  value,)a difficulty 
that  causes  traders  to  call  a  regular  knock-out  a  vanilla  by comparison. 

Knock-out  options  are  often  unaccommodating  to  trade  because  of  the 
discontinuity  in  the  deltas  as  the  option  crosses  the  trigger.  Slippage  is 
greatest  with  them,  particularly  when  gaps  occur  and  the  trader  who  needs 
to  unwind  his  hedge  at  some  price  ends  up  doing  so  at  a  markedly  less  at- 
tractive  level.  This  is  one  reason  that  dynamic  hedging  is  said  to  be  costly. 
When  in  possession  of  a  large  enough  size  to  impact  the  market,  however, 
some  traders  are  known  to  create  considerable  profits  out  of  their  struc- 
tures.  These  are  the  cases  that  create  liquidity  holes,  much  to  the  consterna- 
tion  of  the  financial  community,  whose  members  see  the  knock-outs  as  a 
source  of large  volatility. 

Example: 
If  the  underlying  security  trades  at  100,  assuming  no  for- 
ward  curve,  a  one-month  at-the-money  option  would  trade  at  1.80%  of 
face  value. 

314 

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

The  same  at-the-money  call  but  knocking  out  2%  below  the  present 
strike  would  trade  for  1.34%  (plus  a  higher  commission  owing  to  its 
wider  bid  /offer  spread). 

From  the  customer  point  of view,  if the  market  should  rally  immedi- 
ately,  the  knock-out  will  be equivalent  to  a  regular  call  obtained  cheaper. 
In  a  break,  the  worst-case  scenario  will  be  the  same.  The  knock-out 
would  fare  worse  if the  market  went  down  prior  to  the  rally,  a  scenario 
that  tends  to  occur  somewhat  more  often  than  the  theory  would  suggest 
(Figure  19.1). 

Customer  Demand  for  Knock-Out  Options.  Many  customers  prefer  to 
use  barrier  options  for  the  simple  reason  that  they  come  cheaper.  In  addi- 
tion,  many  users  of  an  option  prefer  to  rid  themselves  of  it  when  it  is  no 
longer  needed. 

The  major  users  are  as  follows: 

e  Funds  managers  holding  a  large  stock  market  exposure,  in  order  to 
lower  their  hedging  expenditure.  Funds  managers  owning  stocks  al- 
ways  prefer  to  own  puts  as  protection.  They  generally  feel,  however, 
that  5%  above  the  market  they no  longer  need  such protection  as  they 
would  normally  flatten  themselves  up  in such  conditions.  Such  a 
profile  is  similar  to  that  of  a  risk  reversal  (or  collar)  except  that  they 
would  not  necessarily  lose  their  stocks  in a  violent  rally. 

¢  Speculators  who  believe  strongly  in  trends  and  serial  correlation  (or 
dependence)  in  a  market.  A fund  manager  prefers  to  be  long  as  long 
as  the  market  does  not  sell  below  a  certain  point.  He  can  thus  buy 
an  out-of-the-money  call  that  knocks  out  at  a  certain  price  if he  is 
wrong.  The  knock-out  agrees  with  the  psychology  of  trend  follow- 
ers.  Its  path  dependency  conforms  to  their  beliefs  in the  shape  of the

distribution.  They  believe  that  the  world  is  going  to  behave  differ- 
ently  than  a  random  walk  and  that  they  can  translate  their  beliefs 
into  option  trades.  Most  frequently,  the barrier  would  be placed  close 
to  a  chart  point  or  some  level  that  chartists  consider  critical  for  the 
market  direction.  When  chartists  lose  faith  in  a  trend,  they  do  not 
mind  canceling  their  bet.

they could  square  it up  should  the  market  move  their  way.

at  the  barrier.  In  the  earlier  example  of  100  calls/KO  98 (pronounced  100 
calls knock-out 98 in the  vernacular),  it moves from  .66  to zero.  The  seller  of 
the  option  can  either  jump  up  in joy for  having  lost  a  liability  or  jump  up  in 
anger  at  having  lost  considerable  money  by being  filled  at  worse  than  the 
stop  level  he  set  at 98.00. 

Figure  19.2  shows  the  behavior  of  the  delta  of  the  KO  at  different  asset 
price  levels.  In this  example,  the  trader  who  is short  the  knock-out  call  needs 
to  buy  more  contracts  than  if he  were  short  a  vanilla.  While  the  vanilla  has 
the  at-the-money  delta  close  to  50%,  the  knock-out  option  has  a  delta  of about 
68%.  This  is to  compensate  for  the  fact  that  in the  rally the  knock-out  and  the 
vanilla  will  be equivalent  in price,  whereas  the  trader  sold  the  knock-out  at  a 
lower  price  than  the  vanilla.  As  the  market  goes  higher,  however,  the  deltas 
and  prices  converge. 

Should  the  market  jump  down  by 2 points  immediately,  the  68%  deltas 
would  generate  close  to  $1.36  per  unit  sold.  To  be  exact,  $1.34  because  the 
final  delta  in  the  example  is 66%,  causing  the  structure  to  be  hedged  at  an 
average  delta  of  .67  (owing  to  the  small  gamma  effect  of  the  move).  The 
trader  sold  the  option  at  1.34.  But  he needs  more  than  1.34  to  cover  the  trans- 
action  costs  of liquidation  at  the  barrier.

Trading  Rule: 
should  be  taken  into  account  when  selling  a  barrier. 

The  transaction  costs  of  unwinding  the  hedge 

Let  us  say  that  some  panic  choked  the  market  and  that  the  execution  slip- 
page  at  the  barrier  turned  out  to  be  .10.  This  translates  into  a  final  price  for 
the  barrier  of at  least  .1  X  .66  =  0.066  more  than  the  initial  1.34  should  the 
option  terminate.  Therefore  the  minimum  fair  value  for  the  operator  will 
be  1.34  plus  .066  times  the  probability  of  hitting  the  barrier  (which  corre- 
sponds  to  the  value  of an  American  binary  paying  .066  at 98  and  expiring  at 
the  same  time  as  the  barrier  option).  It will  be roughly  1.39.  That  is the  min- 
imum,  as  more  costs  will  crop  up  to  affect  the  structure. 
Ass the market approaches the barrier, the deltas of the knock-out and~ 

_  Ke  vanillas  start  to  diverge:  The  trader  needs  to  accumulate  more  and 
“more  delta to make up for the fact that he  might  lose  the  option  soon  and 
be  freed  of  an  obligation.  When  the  asset  becomes  close  to  the  barrier, 
however,  he needs  to  unwind  the  deltas  as  they become  superfluous.  It is a 
double-edged  sword.  Hitting  the  barrier  is  a  blessing  because  the  trader 
loses  a  liability  (the  option),  but  the  way  the  barrieris  touched  is  signifi- 
cant.  Should  the  market  gap  through  the  barrier  (it  often  does  so),  the 
hedge  would  be  unwound  at  a  worse  level  than  expected  and  the  trader 
would  wish  he  had  not  hit  the  barrier.  The  slippage  around  the  barrier  is 
meaningful.

Knock-In  Options 

Api knockin option i an  option  that  comes  into  existence  when a particu- 
ar  price  1s hit in the  market.)A 
regular  knock-in  comes  into  existence  as  it is 
out-of-the-money  which  simplifies  its  trigger  conditions.  A reverse  knock- 
in  comes  into  the  world  with  intrinsic  value  (by  the  forward),  which  com- 
plicates  its  existence. 

Studying  knock-in  options  as  their  own  instrument  must  be limited  be- 
cause  they  are,  by construction,  nothing  but  a  combination  of a  vanilla  and 
a  knock-out.  This  will  be  shown  later  in the  section.

Example: 
Using  a  similar  example  as  before—a  one-month  100  call 
knocking  in  at  98—Figure  19.4  shows  an  interesting  graph.  The  first 
time  traders  encounter  the  plot of the  price  with  respect  to  the  underly- 
ing security,  they know  they are  confronted  with  two  piecewise  options 
of opposing  deltas.

although  its  move  is  in  the  opposite  sign.  This  means  that  the  knock-in 
could  complement  the  knock-out  of  same  maturity  and  strike  to  create  a

the  barrier,  the  delta  of  the  knock-in  moves  up  from  —.32  to  .33, 
wich  means  that  the  operator  has  a  gap  delta  of  65  to  make  up  tor,  7 
nock-out  call,  likewise,  has  a  gap  delta of a jump  down  of .65,  which  means 
that  the  operator  long  one  and long the other  would  have  nothing  to  do. 
This  is the  basis  for  the  rule  of the  short  barrier. 

I Long  the  barrier  means  that  the  operator  benefits  from  the  hitting  of 
the  trigger,  either  by the  decrease  in  liability  (a knock-out)  or  by an  in- 
crease  in  wealth  (a knock-in). 

A  short  knock-out  is  long  the  barrier.  A  long  knock-in  is  long  the  bar- 
rier.JA  short  knock-out  benefits  when  the  market  hits  the  trigger  as  the  con- 
tingent  liability  extinguishes.  A long  knock-in  benefits  in the  same  manner, 
as  the  triggering  moves  it from  a  conditional  asset  (the  underlying  option) 
to  an  unconditional  one. 

By extension,  the  long  knock-in  and  long  knock-out  are  flat  the  barrier 
and  have  exposure  to  the  underlying  option,  hence  the  arbitrage  relationship: 

Caen (K,  t/t)  +  Knock-out(K, 

A)  =sVamilla  (K,  2) 

Where K is  the  strike  price,  t time  to  expiration,  and  H  the  barrier  level.  A 
long  knock-in  of one  strike  plus long  knock-out  of  the  same strike  and ma- 
turity  are  equal  to a  long vanilla  (Cook at the  one-month  100  calls  KO  98,  100

Trading  Rule: 
Volatility  brings  the  barrier  closér  in  a  nonlinear 
way.  This  occurs  because  volatility  is  always  non-linear  for  events 
‘that  are  away  from  the  center  of  the  distribution  (they  affect  the 
out-of-the-money  and in-the-money  options). 

Close  to  the  barrier,  the  options  have  different  vegas  since  the  barrier 
loses  in convexity.  Far  from  the  barrier  (the  “other  side”),  the  options  would 
start  converging  in  behavior,  including  their  sensitivity  to  volatility.  It  is 
understandable  that when the barrier  is away from the asset price, the bar- 
rier  option  converges  in p 
nilla.  Operators  thus  test  bar- 
Tier  pricing  systems  by placing  the  barrier  at  0 (or  .00001)  for  a  knock-out 
call  and  a  very  high number  for  a  knock-out  put and  verifying  that  the  price 
becomes  that  of a  vanilla. 

This  leads  to  the  vega  linearity  rule. 

ae 

Trading  Rule: 
The  vegas  emanating  from  the  barrier  part  of  a 
barrier  option  are  concave  for  the  seller.  The  combination  barrier 
vega  +  vanilla  vega  will  result  in  a  concave  vega  for  the  long  bar- 
rier  (see  definition)  and  a  convex  vega  for  the  short  barrier. 

e  extension  of the  rule  is that  the  concavity/convexity  would  start  vanish- 
ing  as  the  trader  moves  away  from  the  barrier  into  areas  where  the  vanilla 
dominates.  Figures  19.9  and  19.10  show  the  vegas  of the  two  instruments.

A  more  thorough  analysis  will  involve  changing  the  example  into  an 
out-of-the-money  option  struck  at  105  with  the  same  trigger  at  98.  The  ma- 
turity  is lengthened  to  take  a  6-month  option;  volatility  remains  at  15.7%. 

igure  19.11  shows  the  shifts  in  vega  from  changing  the  asset  price.  As 
the  market  moves  away  from  the  barrier,  the  vegas  of  the  knock-out  call 
start

Ges the  vega  of the  knock-in  call  will  start  resembling  those  of the

Adding  the  Drift:  Complexity  of the  Forward  Line 

\ Fk Management  Rule:  A regular  knock-out  (i.e.,  triggered  when 
itis  out  of the  money)  will  never  have  a  delta  higher  than  one  if the 
cash-forward  line  is  flat.  In  an  upward  sloping  forward  curve,  the 
delta  of  the  calls  can  be  higher  than  one.  In  a  downward  sloping 
curve,  that  of the  put would  be,  too.

Risk  Reversals 

Comparing  the  vegas  of the  knock-in  and  knock-out  with  those  of  risk  re- 
versals  would  reveal  some  striking  similarities:  a vega  that  increases  in one 
direction  and  fades  in  the  other.  This  prompted a rich  literature  of  option 
replication  through  risk  reversals. 

Put/Call  Symmetry  and  the  Hedging  of  Barrier  Options 

This  section  examines  the  technique  of hedging  the  barrier  option  by sym- 
metry  as  exposed  in the  common  literature  before  warning  the  trader  about 
some  of the  pitfalls  of the  blind  execution  of the  concept.  The  exact  deriva- 
tion  and  reasoning  behind  the  formula  is provided  later  in the  section  “The 
Reflection  Principle.”

Option  Wizard:  Option  Symmetry 

Peery European  option  has  a  symmetrical  equivalent  pair  that  matches  its  risk. 
The  symmetry  is established  vis-a-vis  the  forward,  not the  cash.  That  amount  is 
called  “distance.”  Assuming  no  skew  (i.e.,  symmetrical  volatility  on  both  sides 
of the  forward),  the  distance 

between  puts  and  calls  is computed 

as  Tollows: 

is one  strike  price  and  F the  forward.  The  symmetrical  K’  (a put  ifKisa 

call  and  a  call  if K is  a  put)  assumes  the  equality. *

The  second,  symmetrical  strike  is set  ina  way  to  make  the  forward  become 
the  geometric  average  of the  two  strikes.  The  preceding  chart  shows  the  strikes 
K1  and  K2  and  their  corresponding  symmetrical  K’  1 and  K’  2. 

In the absence of a skew,  the  strikes  will  be  set  so  that  the  ratio  of  price 

between  put  and  calls  will  be  the  square  root  of the  ratio  of the  strikes:

The  reader  could,  solely  for  entertainment,  test  the  equality  during  a  mo- 

ment  of (severe)  boredom. 

The  symmetry  should  present  the  following  gu  ek one  short  the

moments  until the third 

moment. 

Experienced  dynamic  hedgers  consider  the  notion  of  symmetry  unstable. 
There  is  an  extreme  difference  between  “upside”  and  “downside”  strikes,  ex- 
treme  to  the  point  of  causing  meaningful  behavioral  differences  if the  market 
rallies  or  sells. 

*While  put/call  symmetry  has  been  practiced  by  traders  for  a  few  decades,  the  first  formal 
treatment  of the  subject  can  be  found  in  Carr  (1994).

This  method  has  been  deemed  questionable  by the  author.  Its  value  is 

pedagogical  as  it gives  some  insight  on  the  risks  of barrier  structures. 

Assuming  no  drift,  the  barrier  could  be  somewhat  replicated  using  the 
risk  reversal.  Assume  further  that  a  call  knock-out  is a  call  but  not  quite  so. 
So  it could  be  a  long  call  mitigated  with  a  short  out-of-the-money  put.  The 
strike  of  the  out-of-the-money  put  should  be  selected  to  be  entirely  sym- 
metrical  to  the  call  at  the  barrier—in  such  a  way  and  in  such  amounts  that 
the  structure  would  be worth  exactly  0 when  the  market  reaches  the  barrier 
level.  Assume  the  trader  is dealing  with  a  105  call  KO  98 for  6 months.  There 
is a  structure,  such  as  an  out-of-the-money  put that,  combined  with  the  105 
call,  should  be  able  to  replicate  the  barrier  option  everywhere  except  on  ter- 
mination,  in  which  case  the  barrier  needs  to  be  unwound  in  the  market. 
Such  a  structure  is only  effective  if the  volatility  does  not  change  at  all  dur- 
ing the  operation. 

Case  1:  Knock-Out  Call 

Assuming  the  market  trades  at  100  and  volatility  at  15.7%. 

Price  of 6-month  vanilla  105  Strike  call:  2.35 

Price  of  the  6-month  KO  (105/98)  call:  1.06.  The  notation  KO  (strike, 
outstrike)  is used  in  the  examples. 

The  symmetrical  put  should  be  of a  strike  price  that,  multiplied  by the 
strike  of the  call  (i.e.,  105),  satisfies  the  geometric  average  98.  It will  be 
such  that  K  X  105.987.  K =  91.47 
Price  of the  put symmetrical  to  the  KO  with  strike  91.47:  1.20 
The  ratio  of  puts  to  calls  should  be  V(105/91.47)  =  1.0714  puts 
for 1 call. 

The  trader  should  verify  that  at  the  barrier  (i.e.,  98.00),  the  risk  reversal 
should  be  worth  0. 

One  additional  constraint  on  the  replication:  The  risk  reversal 
needs  to  be  closed  in  the  market  after  the  barrier  is  hit.  However,  the  re- 
striction  needs  not  to  be  stringent:  A  simple  execution  of a  delta  neutral- 
ity would  do  immediately  after  the  trigger  is  hit.  The  trader  would  then 
have  ample  time  to  close  the  risk  reversal.  Table  19.2  plots  the  risk  rever- 
sal  prices. 

The  thinking  goes:  The  barrier  is nothing  but  some  form  of risk  rever- 
sal.  It  should  then  react,  in  its  vega,  like  the  risk  reversal.  The  reader 
should  retain  the  major  benefits  of  this  methodology  while  remaining 
cautious  about  its  pitfalls.  An  important  result  is  that  the  barrier  call 
is  a downside  skew  than  when  there  4 
should  be  sold  cheaper  when 
aflatskew.

Extending  it  to  knock-in  options  should  be  straightforward  because  KI 
call  (105/98)  +  KO  call  (105/98)  =  Vanilla 
It  follows  that 
K1I(105/98)  =  Vanilla  call  (105)  —  KO(105/98).  Since  the  KO  call  (105/98)  was 
constructed  with:  —  1.0714  put  (91.47)  +  call  (105)  by the  previous  equality, 
one  gets:

fence the  replicating  portfolio  of  the  knock-in  is  the  put  (in  some 
ratio)

The  perfect  replication  would  then  entail  executing  the  risk  reversal  @ 
the  barrier  by swapping  the  put  into  a  call.  Table  19.3  plots  the  knock-in 
replication. 

Case  2:  Knock-In  Call 

The  option  constitutes  a  switch:  At  98,  when  the  passage  from  one  to  the 
other  takes  place,  the  risk  reversal  (in  a  ratio  of  1  call  to  1.0714  puts)  is

worth  exactly  0. So the  knock-in  represents  a  switch  from  one  to the  other  at 
that  particular  price. 

Benefits  of the  Method. 
presents  three  major  results: 

Viewing  the  barrier  as  an  embedded  risk  reversal 

1.  Pricing  the  skew.  The  slope  of  the  skew  should  be  kept  in  mind 
when  analyzing  the  barrier.  This  is  a methodology  similar  to  the  bi- 
nary  option  analysis.  Later  in the  chapter,  a methodology  will  be de- 
rived  to  incorporate  the  skew  and  take  into  account  its  effect  on 

structures. 

2.  Pricing  the  volatility  curve.  The  term  structure  of volatility  matters 
significantly,  as  will  be  seen  later  with  the  concept  of stopping  time. 
It is interesting,  however,  to  see  that  the  decomposition  of the  barrier 
leads  to  two  options  of a  different  duration  on  the  volatility  ladder.  In 
the  case  of the  knock-out  call,  the  put leg of the  risk  reversal  reacts  to

one  period  while  the  call  leg reacts  to  another.  In the  case  of knock- 
in options,  the  analysis  is even  more  complex. 
Hedging.  A  barrier  option,  like  a  risk  reversal,  is  composed  of  two 
polar  components.  At  any  time,  only  one  of  them  dominates  when 
the  market  trades  in its  neighborhood.  This  holds  for  barriers  (out of 
the  money  when  they  knock  out  or  in),  not  so  for  reverse  barriers 
where  the  large  payoff  is dominating.  In  the  previous  examples,  the 
call  comes  alive  and  dominates  in  the  rally  and  weakens  in  the  sell- 
off  with  the  put  taking  over.  The  option  will  therefore  show  a  long 
sell-off.  Would  a  risk  rever- 
gamma  in a rally  and  a  short  gamma  ina 
sal  hedge  the  structure?  In most  cases—but  not  all. 

Pitfalls  of  the  Method. 
is grounded  on  the  following  assumptions: 

The  method  of hedging  through  the  risk  reversal 

Barrier  Options  (I)

e  Stable  (preferably  constant)  skew. 

e 

Flat  and  constant  forward  curve  (no  drift  or  premium/discount  in 
the  forward  curve). 

Making  the  skew  unstable  would  cause  a  higher  imprecision  in  the 
hedge.  Initially,  whether  the  operator  entered  the  trade  at  a  positive  or  nega- 
tive  skew,  the  position  would  be  locally  matched,  owing  to  the  incorporation 
of  the  skew  price  into  it.  Later  on,  the  skew,  being  unstable,  could  shift  and 
eventually  reverse,  causing  the  trade  to  become  divorced  from  the  skew 
slope.  This  is in addition  to  the  possible  ravages  of time.  This  possible  divorce 
occurs  because  the  skew  hedge  may  not  adequately  match  the  duration  of the 
barrier.  Even  worse,  there  might  not  be  a  real  duration  susceptible  of hedging 
the  skew  owing  to  the  instability  of the  stopping  time. 

Making  the  interest  rates  or  carry  for  the  asset  extremely  positive  or 
negative  would  invalidate  the  method  as,  by the  rules  expressed  earlier  in 
the  chapter,  the  barrier  option  might  no  longer  behave  exactly  like  a  risk  re- 
versal  above  the  barrier.  The  next  section  provides  a  digression  on  the 
behavior  of the  gamma  of a  structure  with  a  flat  forward  curve  and  that  of a 
structure  with  an  exaggerated  interest  rate  differential. 

Gammas  of  Structures  Compared  with  That  of the  Risk  Reversal. 
Assum- 
ing a  flat  forward  curve,  the  knock-out  gamma  would  resemble  the  right  half 
of a  risk  reversal  (Figure  19.15). 

The  knock-in  gamma  would  resemble  the  gamma  of one  call  on  one  side 
of the  hill  (the  right  side)  and  that  of the  put on  the  left  side  of the  hill  (Fig- 
ure  19.16).  The  risk  reversal  is shown  in Figure  19.17. 

Introducing  an  interest  rate  differential  provides  a  more  complicated 

situation,  as  depicted  in Figure  19.18. 

So  what  if a  trader  were  to  look  at  Mexico  or  an  emerging  market  yield- 
ing 45%  interest  rate  differential?  Assume  he  examines  a  one-year  option, 
knock-out  call  on  the  US  dollar,  put,  on  Mexico  scaled  at  100,  with  a  knock- 
out  price  at  105  and a strike  at  102.  He  can  safely  use  a  50%  volatility.  This 

Option  Wizard:  Where  There  Is Skew,  There  Is Skew  Instability 

Traders  notice  that  the  existence  of  a  skew  is  accompanied  by  a  noticeable 
shifting  of  the  third  moment  (i.e.,  a  strong  fifth  moment).  Distributions  with 
strongly  positive  or  negative  third  moment  will  have  strongly  positive  or  nega- 
tive  fifth  moment  and  a  higher  fourth  moment. 

That  a  market  needs  a  skew  in  its  option  volatility  surface  is  a consequence 

of asymmetry  and a sign  of structural  instability.

will  help  the  reader  understand  why  institutions  chronically  mismanage 
their  emerging  market  positions. 

Figures  19.19  and  19.20  show  that,  in  these  conditions,  the  barrier  op- 
tion  behaves  like  a  full  risk  reversal,  not  like  a  half  risk  reversal  as  depicted 
in  Figure  19.15.  In  other  words,  its  gamma  changes  in  sign  to  the  right  of 
the  barrier,  quite  a  confusing  matter. 

To  price  that  “Mexico  effect”  on  any  path-dependent  option,  it is nec- 
essary  to  use  the  Dupire-Derman-Kani  techniques  explained  later  in  the 
book. 

Barrier  Decomposition  under  Skew  Environments?  Y, 

If in Case  1 (the  knock-out  call)  the  puts  traded  at a  premium  (i.e.,  the  lower 
strikes  traded  at  a premium  to  the  higher  strikes),  the  operator  could  afford 
to  sell  the  barrier  cheaper.

Option  Wizard:  Long  Skew/Short  Skew  (Last  Comment  on  the  Skew) 

Long  skew  means  having  the  vega  (and/or  gamma)  increase  in the  rally  and  de- 
crease  in  the  sell-off. 

Short  skew  means  having  the  vega  (or gamma)  decrease  in the  rally  and  in- 

crease  in  the  sell-off. 

Long  skew  means  benefiting  from  a  positive  third  moment.  Short  skew 

means  benefiting  from  a  negative  third  moment. 

Trading  Rule:  Assuming a flat  calendar,  in a positive  skew  (higher 
strikes  at a  premium),  the  knock-out  call  option  will  be cheaper  than 
in a  flat  world.  The  opposite  applies  to  the  negative  skew.  The  oppo- 
site  also  applies  to  the  put  (assuming  the  put  is a  regular  knock-out, 
not  a  reverse  knock-out). 

In  general,  if the  trigger  is  higher  than  the  strike,  the  knock-out  option  is 

|  short  the  skew,  and  vice  versa. 

: 

The  skew  procedure  will  be analyzed  in two  steps.  The  first  one  is to  ig- 
nore  first  exit  time  and  simplify  the  world  to  look  at the  skew  in a spatial  di- 
mension.  After  acquiring  some  familiarity  with  stopping  time,  it should  be 
possible  to  examine  the  skew  in  two  dimensions. 

Thus  this  analysis  (for  pedagogical  reasons)  takes  place  in  the  flat  cal- 
endar  world,  which  means  that  options  trade  at  the  same  volatility  regard- 
less  of expiration. 

The  trader  may  attempt  to  quantify  the  skew  for  Case  1. 
If the  replicating  portfolio  is priced  on  the  skew  curve,  the  trader  would 
have  to  find  the  portfolio  that  can  be  worth 0 at  the  trigger  time.  That  port- 
folio  includes  selling  a  put further  out  of the  money.  Case  1 would  not  pro- 
duce  in  a  skew  environment  a call  (K)  —  ratio  X  put(K’)  =  0.  Say  that  the 
skew  traded  at a  slope making  the 91.47  trade  at  1.7 volatility  points  over  the 
105  calls.  The  trader  tries  the  replication  of Case  1 (Table  19.4). 

Obviously,  it  does  not  work.  The  risk  reversal  has  a  residual  value  of 
(0.45)  at  the  barrier.  So  he  needs  to  scale  put/call  symmetry  to  introduce 
some  skew  effect  to  it. He  looks  for  the  put that,  combined  with  the  call,  sat- 
isfies  the  replicating  portfolio  value  of 0 at  the  barrier. 

The  put is 89.92,  which  he  found  by iteration;  he  solved  for  the  strike  of 
the  put  that  would  be  worth  1.74,  the  call  value,  when  multiplied  by the 
square  root  of 105/strike.  He  also  found  it to  trade  at 2 volatility  points  over 
the  105  call.  The  89.92  put  has  a  value  of  1.62  at  98,  which  multiplied  by 
V105/89.92  becomes  1.74,  the  exact  value  of the  call.

The  hint:  Because  the  trader  sold  a  put that  is further  out-of-the-money, 
the  entire  structure  would  behave  difterently  than  before.  The  first  lesson 
in  skew  trading  is  learning  that  options  that  trade  at  different  volatilities 
exhibit  unequal  time  decay.  The  trader  solved  for  a  replicating  portfolio  that 
“has no residual value foday upon  reaching  the  trigger.  Tomorrow,  however, 
there  will  be  a  residual  value  at  the  trigger,  given  that  the  89.92  put  that  he 
is short,  will  decay  at  a  higher  speed  than  the  105  call. 

Result:  The positive  skew  drops  the value of the barrier. 
Table  19.5  verifies  that  the  replicating  portfolio  above  the  barrier  would 
provide a residual  value  that  would  let  a  trader  executing  the  trade  against 
a barrier  option  priced  at  fat  skew  eke  out  a  profit. 

This  confirms  any  skew  trader’s  intuition:  The  put/call  symmetry  ob- 
tained  on  a  skew  would  decay  favorably.  The  last  column  shows  the  differ- 
ence.  The  difference  will  peak but  reach  0 if the  market  does  not  move,  as  all 
the  options  would  then  expire  worthless. 

The  dependence  of  the  skew  premium  on  time  to  expiration  shown  in 
Figures  19.21  and  19.22  shows  traders  the  need  for  a  more  complex  pricing 
tool  in  the  presence  of a  skew,  any  skew,  in  the  market.  Currently,  there  is 
no  known  closed  formula  for  that  purpose.  It also  illustrates  the  need  to  use 
a  numerical  method  factoring  the  skew  to  price  barrier  options.

The  reflection  principle  and  the  Girsanov  theorem  will  augment  insight 

into  this  method. 

The  Reflection  Principle 

Another  way  of  looking  at  the  barrier  symmetry  is  through  the  reflection 
principle  (see  Figure  19.23).°  For  a random  walk,  the  paths  from  a  point  a  to 

Figure  19.23 

The  reflection  principle. 

336 

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

a  point b that  do  not  go  through  the  origin  (zero)  are  equal  to  the  number  of 
paths  from  —a  to  b. 

This  principle  works  on  arithmetic  paths  only.  To  accommodate  finan- 

cial  markets,  it is necessary  to  trick  it by using  the  logarithm  of the  prices. 

This  links  back  to  the  notion  of  option  symmetry  (see  Figure  19.24). 
Using  the  regular  example  of a  market  trading  at  100,  with  a  98  knock-out 
barrier,  the  number  of paths  from  100  to  any  point  higher  than  it that  does 
not  touch  the  barrier  of 98  is equal  to  the  number  of paths  from  987/100  to 
the  same  point.  Option  symmetry  can  define  the  distance  in  logarithmic 
terms  to  accommodate  a  geometric  Brownian  motion.  So  Log  (100/98)  = 
Log (98/96.04). 

From  here  we  can  proceed  to  an 
Example.  Binomial  Tree  (Simplified): 
intuitive  understanding  of the  skew  with  the  barrier  option.  This  exam- 
ple will  also  allow  the  reader  to  review  binomial  option  pricing.  Figure 
19.25  shows  the  paths  from  100  leading  to  in-the-money  parts  on  the 
map  (higher  than  100).  It is assumed  that  there  are  20  trading  days  (one 
month)  with  movement  of  .99  per  day,  risk  neutral,  simply  chosen  for 
pedagogical  reasons  (ignore  lognormality  for  such  an  interval  and  as- 
sume  a  “fudge,”  to  have  the  up-probability  initially  equal  to  the  down- 
probability*).  Path  1 shows  the  number  of paths  from  100  leading  to  each 
terminal  node  (i.e.,  the  vanilla  option).  Path  2  shows  the  number  of 
paths  from  96.04  to  the  same  end  nodes  (i.e.,  the  difference  between  the 
vanilla  and  the  barrier). 

For  the  vanilla,  option  pricing  is commonly  done  by multiplying  the 
intrinsic  value  on  the  end  node  by the  risk-neutral  probability  of occur- 
rence.  The  trader  should  be  careful  to  consider  such  risk-neutrality  as 
an  arbitrage  derivation  (i.e.,  an  option  =  expected  cost  of gamma  P/L  as 
explained  in  Module  B).  Here  it is  readily  computed  as  the  number  of 
paths  at  the  node  divided  by the  total  number  of  possible  paths  times 
the  payoff.

In  Figure  19.25,  the  total  number  of paths  is 2°  =  1,048,576  paths.  Ex- 
pected  payoff  at  any  node  is  equal  to  intrinsic  value  times  probability. 
Probability  equals  number  of  possible  paths/total  number  of  paths.  So 
looking  at  the  column  Path  1,  expected  payoff  at  node  103.96  =  3.96  x 
38760/1048576  =  .1463. 

The  reader  can  also  verify  risk  neutrality  with  no  drift:  Every  possible 
outcome  weighted  by its  probability  adds  up  to  100.  It is called  the  “condi- 
tional  expectation  of the  future  asset  price  at  time  t,” conditional  means  that 
the  expectation  is based  on  information  at  the  present. 

The  reader  can  also  price  the  vanilla  call  struck  at  100.  It is equal  to  in- 

trinsic  times  the  probability  of every  level,  as  shown  in Table  19.6. 

The  value  of the  vanilla  option  can  be  intuitively  derived  as  the  sum  of 
the  expected  values  at  every  node.  The  precision  increases  with  the  higher 
number  of steps. 

In  Figure  19.25,  Path  2  shows  the  number  of  paths  that  do  not  go 
through  the  barrier  using  the  reflection  principle.  The  value  of the  barrier 
option  would  therefore  be  the  payoff  (column  labeled  “Intrinsic”)  times  the 
column  net/total  number  of paths.

Repeating  the  exercise  of Table  19.6,  the  trader  derives  the  price  of  the 

same  option  but  with  a  knock-out  barrier  at  98  (see  Table  19.7). 

is leads  to  the  equality:  In  the  absence  of skew  and  drift,  a  regular 
kyock-out  option  (that  knocks  out  while  out of the money),  when  the  asset 
rades  at  S, with  a  strike  K and  barrier  H is equal  to  the  vanilla  option  of 
the  same  strike  and  maturity  minus  the  same  vanilla  option  priced  with 
the  spot  at  S’  such  that  S’  is  the  symmetrical  reciprocal  of  S  centered

around  H  (S S’  =  H’).  The  amounts  need  to  be  adjusted  by their  adequate 
ratio’  V (5/5 ). 

Example:  A 3-month  knock-out  call  strike  100,  spot  100,  barrier  at 98  is 
equal  to  the  price  of  the  vanilla  minus  100/98  times  the  same  vanilla 
priced  at  96.04. 

This  can  lead  to  the  notion  of risk  reversal.  Applying  put/call  parity,  as 
well  as  the  change  of  numeraire  method,  a  call  with  a  strike  price  of  100, 
priced  with  a  96.04  spot  will  be  equal  in  price  to  the  96.04  put  priced  with 
the  spot  at  100.  This  proves  the  skew  rules  shown  earlier. 

An  extension  of this  notion  is that,  with  a  reverse  knock-out  option  or  a 
regular  knock-out  that  presents  a  rebate,  the  rules  are  more  complicated  as 
one  needs  to  add  the  payoff  of the  corresponding  American  binary. 

Girsanov 

It is  easy  to  introduce  the  drift  in  the  preceding  framework  to  mix  it with 
the  reflection  principle.  This  would  be done  in assuming  different  probabil- 
ities  on  exactly  the  same  path  structure,  to  compensate  for  the  drift.  The 
path  remaining  the  same,  the  probabilities  are  shifted  to  alter  the  payoff 
without  changing  the  paths. 

Assume  that  over  the  same  period,  the  spot  needs  to  earn  .99%  per 
month.  It  means  that  we  expect  that  the  resulting  price  after  one  month 
would  be  100.99. 

The  Girsanov  theorem  allows  traders  to  change  the  probability  of every 
outcome  upward  or  downward  to  allow  for  the  expected  return  of 100.99.  In 
the  example,  the  trader  will  have  to  shift  the  final  probabilities.  The  module 
{pricing  contingent  claims}  presents  a  more  formal  presentation  of  the 
method.  Figure  19.26  shows  the  payoffs. 

Repricing  the  option  shows  that  the  value  of the  package  changed  (Table 

19.8); 

Effect  of Time  on  Knock-Out  Options  — 

With  regular  knock-outs,  the  effect  of  time  is  not  truly  perfidious,  unlike 
reverse  knock-outs  where  it  can  be  harrying.\  Time  makes  the  underlying 
option  lose  its  value  faster  but  at  the  same  time  increases  discontinuity  at 
the  barrier,  which  mitigates  the  effect:  What  would  be  knocked  out  will 
have  less  and  less  value!  Figure  19.27  shows  this  effect. 

With  knock-in  optidns,  however,  the  barrier  has  less  effect  in  dominat- 
ing the  structure  because  there  are  no  conflicting  options  in  the  structure. 
Figure  19.28  illustrates  this  effect.

First  Exit  Time  and  Its  Risk-Neutral  Expectation 

The  expected  first  exit  time  (or  stopping  time)  is  the  time  an  asset  price 
is  expected  to  cross  a  given  point  in  the  market,  conditional  on  an 
expiration  date.  Module  G  (Pricing  Contingent  Claims)  provides  the  cal- 
culation  for both  the  distribution  of the  first  exit  time  and  its expectation. 

Cees  option  unlike  a  European  binary  needs  to  be  hedged  using 
instruments  that  have  a  similar  duration.  This  necessitates  the  knowledge 
at  all  times  of  the  expected  first  exit  time,  which  is  in  this  case  the  time 
when  the  barrier  is  hit.  The  difference  between  the  nominal  expiration 
and  the  expected  stopping  time  will  correspond  to  the  dominance  of  the 
barrier  in  the  structure.  When  the  barrier  is weak  (by exerting  a  small  in- 
fluence  on  the  risks  of the  structure),  the  expected  exit  time  is equal  to  the 
nominal  duration.  When  the  barrier  is  strong,  it  will  be  considerably 
shorter.

The  expected  first  exit  time  can  thus  be  represented  as  shown  in  Fig- 

BRM  a) 

As  volatility  increases,  the  option  shortens  and  the  barrier  starts  domi- 
nating.  When  volatility  is low,  the  underlying  option  dominates  and  the  ex- 
pected  first  exit  time  becomes  the  maturity  of the  vanilla. 

Trading  Rule: 
The  certainty  that  first  exit  time  is  shorter  than  or 
equal  to  the  nominal  maturity  makes  any  nonarbitrage  static  repli- 
cation  of a  barrier  with  combination  of vanillas  imperfect.

The  consequences  of the  risk  management  rule  are: 

Any  vega  hedge  against  the  barrier  needs  to  take  into  account  the 
first  exit  time  for  the  matching  of the  barrier  payoff. 

¢  Hedging  the  forw  d exposure  stemming  from  the  barrier  needs  to 
be  done  carefully.(First  exit  can  move,  and  may  lengthen  or  shorten. 
A  lengthening  of  the  expected  first  exit  would  necessitate  a  length- 
ening  of  the  maturity  of  the  hedge? This  rebalancing  can  consume 
massive  transaction  costs.  It is therefore  recommended  to  hedge  at  a 
shorter  maturity  than  the  nominal  one. 

e 

First  exit  time  depends  on  the  volatility.  Where  there  is  a  volatility 
curve  in  the  market,  positive  and  negative,  the  first  exit  time  would 
lengthen  or  shorten. 

Issues  in  Pricing  Barrier  Options 

(Since the  first  exit  time  is uncertain,  it is necessary  to  know  where  it is  lo- 
‘cated  on  the  term  structure  for  pricing  purposes) Currently,  most  systems 
offered  to  traders  present  an  erroneous  system  of  pricing.  There  are  two_ 
methods  of fudging  matters: 

| 

1.  The  single  volatility  fudge.  It is  less  computer  intensive  but  lacks  accu- 
racy.  This  author  recommends  using  it only  to  patch  up  the  flaws  in 
the  pricing  formulas.  It provides  a  half-answer. 

2.  The  pricing  on  a forward-forward  curve  (the  Dupire  method).  It is more 
computer  intensive 
but  is  generally  accurate  in determining  the  real 
value  and  the  appropriate  hedges.  Some  people  complain  about  the 
burdening  implementation  and  convergence  difficulties.

¢  Step 2.  Find  the  expected  stopping  time.  Notice  that  it is a  distribu- 
tion,  not  a  fixed  point  in  time.  Assume  the  expected  stopping  time 
was  derived  to  be  close  to  6 months.  Therefore,  interpolating  on  Fig- 
ure  19.30,  the  volatility  to  use  is  10.95,  which  should  define  that  of 
the  knock-out  option.

priced  as  an  option  maturing  with  the  nominal  value.  The  second  op- 
tion  needs  to  be  priced  using  the  parameters  of first  exit  time.  Thus  a 
skew  dimension  would  be  added  to  the  risk  reversal. 

¢  Step  4. 

Find  the  forward-forward  between  the  stopping  time  and 
the  end  date.  Using  the  formula  of Chapter  9,  the  reader  will  obtain 
FFwd  (6,9)  =  12%.  This  number  is  useful  in  determining  the  value  of 
the  knock-in  of the  same  nominal  duration.

Finally,  the  fact  that  the  stopping 
makes  it necessary  to  specify  the  following  rule.

n isk Management  Rule: 

The  hedges  in  forward  assets  that  corre- 
spond  to  an  option  position  need  to  be  scattered  to  match  the  dis- 

tribution  of first  exit  time. 

A  More  Accurate  Method: 
The  Dupire-Derman-Kani  Technique 

In  1992,  Dupire  presented  the  seminal  notion  of a  two-dimensional  volatility 
process.  Between  one  point  and  another  in  space  (spot/strike)  and  time  (to 
expiration)  there  is  a  volatility  implied  by both  the  skew  and  the  forward- 
forward  volatility  in  the  market.”  This  was  followed  by  breakthrough  re- 
search  by  Dupire  (1993)  and  Derman  and  Kani  (1994).  They  arrived  at  a 
numerical  technique  that  breaks  up  time  into  smaller  sections  between  the 
nodes,  thus  constituting  a  calendar-based  time-speed  function  (one  can  even 

Barrier  Options  (I) 

345 

call  it diagonal).  The  method  entails  the  use  of some  form  of flexible  nodes  in 
the binomial  (or multinomial)  tree. 

The  method  of pricing  on  the  tree  has  serious  implications  for  any  path- 
dependent  structure.  Since  a  barrier  depends  not  just on  one  single  volatility 
but  on  that  of every  node,  the  pricing  can  more  precisely  establish  the  value 
of  the  barrier  using  a  two-dimensional  volatility  surface.  In  effect,  both  the 
forward-forward  problem  and  the  estimation  of the  stopping  time  can  thus 
be  skirted. 

Independently,  in  Berkeley,  Marc  Rubinstein  discovered  the  notion  of 
implied  binomial  tree  and  studied  the  lateral  volatility  between  two  asset 
prices  derived  from  option  prices.  In  other  words,  as  Dupire  and  Derman 
and  Kani  explored  the  process  between  a  point  in  space  (asset  price)  and 
time  (S,  tf) and  (S  +  AS,  t +  At),  Rubinstein  was  independently  discovering 
the  implied  process  betwen  (S,  t) and  (S +  AS,  t). 

A  few  issues,  however,  have  marred  the  implementation  of  these  tech- 
niques.  The  primary  problem  is  that  a  high  number  of  steps  is  needed  to 
make  the  binomial  tree  (or  trinomial)  converge  to  a  stable  price.  This  could 
be  time  consuming  and  many  efforts  at  finding  numerical  techniques  to 
speed  up  the  calculations  and  deliver  feasible  techniques  of option  pricing 
are  under  way. 

To  this  date,  no  commercially  available  system  implements  such 

a  method. 

Additional  Pricing  Complexity:  The  Variance  Ratios 

Option  traders  hedge  themselves  at  a  given  frequency,  say  an  observable 
time  interval.  They  concern  themselves  with  the  volatility  at  the  time  scale 
of  their  intervention.  A  trader  who  hedges  himself  every  few  minutes  will 
not  be concerned  with  tick  volatility.  A barrier  option,  however,  responds  to 
the  infinitesimal  volatility.  The  two  can  be  markedly  different  as  shown  in 
Chapter  6. 

Barrier  options  are  priced  on  the  assumption  of  the  distribution  of  the 
minimum  of  the  maximum  of  a  Brownian  motion  that  follows  the  same 
volatility  as  the  Brownian  motion  itself.  The  most  intuitive  way  to  look  at 
the  barrier  is to  assume  the  risk-neutral  (alas)  discounted  probabilistic  pay- 
off  of  a  vanilla  option  (i.e.,  S —  K  for  the  call  and  K  —  S for  the  put)  condi- 
tional  on  the  stopping  time  not  being  attained  during  that  period.  Putting 
that  condition  on  the  regular  option  represents  the  difference  from  a 
vanilla. 

The  condition  of  the  stopping  time,  however,  may  react  to  the  distribu- 
tion  of the  minimum  of maximum.  The  analysis  of the  Parkinson  number  (see 
Chapter  6) hinted  that  the  distribution  of  the  extremes  on  a  particular  day 
may  be  markedly  different  from  what  would  be  expected  from  a  log-normal 
(or even  normal  as  it does  not  matter  much  within  one  day)  distribution. 

346 

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

Ina  mean-reverting  market,  the  barrier  component 
Mrading  Rule: 
of a  barrier  option  is  overpriced.  In  a  trending  market,  it is  under- 
priced. 

The  explanation  for  this  effect  is that  the  knock-out  option  is more  likely  to 
be  knocked  out  when  the  market  has  a  high  level  of intraday  negative  auto- 
correlation  and  options  are  priced  on  the  close-to-close  volatility.  Remem- 
ber  that  the  structure  is  triggered  off  a  price  printing  on  the  screen,  not  a 
terminal  state  for  the  asset. 

Since  this  is not  an  econometrics  course  but  general  guidelines  for  op- 
tion  hedging,  the  trader  must  decide  on  whether  the  market  follows  one 
particular  process  or  another,  or  whether  one  particular  condition  is  more 
permanent  than  the  other. 

From  this  author’s  experience,  every  market,  including  markets  in- 
volved  in a  trend  (one-week  sampled  volatility  is higher  than  daily  samples) 
will  exhibit  mean  reversion  within  a  one-day  framework.  This  is due  to  the 
execution  slippage  of  the  participants,  to  widening  of  the  bid-offer  spread 
in the  event  of higher  volatility  than  normal,  and  several  other  factors. 
Another  way  to  examine  it is to  use  the  Parkinson  number  rule: 

‘ 

5 

Trading  Rule: 
If  the  close-to-close  volatility  is  lower  than  the 
Parkinson  number,  the  barrier  component  is  underpriced  by  the 
regular  method.  Otherwise,  it could  be  considered  overpriced. 

EXERCISE:  ADDING  THE  PUTS 

As  an  exercise,  the  reader  could  redo  the  previous  examples  by pricing  a  98 
put knocking  out  at  105  and  the  same  one  knocking  in at  105.  The  author  sub- 
scribes  to  the  notion  that  a  put  is nothing  but  a  synthetic  call  and  prefers  to 
spend  appropriate  time  on  the  differences  where  they might  arise.

This  chapter  focuses  on  reverse  barrier  options  and  double  barrier  options.! 

REVERSE  BARRIER  OPTIONS 

Reverse  Knock-Out  Options 

A  reverse  knock-out  is  a  barrier  option  that  terminates  in  the  money, 
therefore  causing  a  large  discrepancy  between  the  values  on  each  side  of 
the  barrier. 

Reverse  knock-outs  are  almost  decomposable  into  regular  knock-outs  plus 
an  American  bet.  However,  one  ends  up  with  the  opposite  gap  delta.  Be- 
cause  a  large  number  of horror  stories  attend  their  risk  management,  it will 
prove  helpful  to  study  reverse  knock-outs  separately. 

A  three-month  call  is  generally  worth  3.11%  of face  at  15.7%  volatility. 
A  reverse  knock-out  that  terminates  at  108  with  no  rebate  will  be  worth 
call will sometimes  pre- 
.55%  only.  Strangely  enough,  the reverse knock-out 
sent  a  negative  delta  (its  price  will  decrease  when  the  market  rallies),  which 
newcomers  to  the  exotics  club  find  difficult  to  conceive  since  ordinary  op- 
tions  gain  in  value  when  their  intrinsic  value  increases.  In  this  case,  how- 
ever,  the  intrinsic  value  disappears  at one  point  so  the  price  decreases  as  the 
market  rallies  close  to  the  barrier.  The  conflicting  pull between the barrier 
and  the  regular  underlying  vanilla  will  show a serious  conflict  throughout 
the  life  of the  instrument. 

Reverse  knockouts  appear  to be priced  abnormally  low, with  their  value 
generally  moving  inversely  to  time:  they  decay  negatively))Such  a  feature 
makes  them  an  attractive  selling  instrument  to  corporates.  The  same  fea- 
ture  creates  nightmares  for  option  traders  and  sleepless  night  fraught  with 
cold  sweats,  as  will  be shown  later. 

347 

348 

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

The  best  intuitive  way  to  view  reverse  knock-out  and  knock-in  options 
is  to  consider  them  American  binary  options  with  a high  payout.  Since  the 
payoff is  in  the  form  of  a  deep-in-the-money  option ‘with  a  high  intrinsic 
and  little  time  value,  they  look  very  little  like  an  option  when  close  to  the 
barrier  and  more  like  a  bet. 

Figures  20.1  and  20.2  show  the  unusual  behavior  of a  reverse  knock- aes 
terminating  at  10,  with  6  months  on  the  clock.  The  reader  will  detect  a 
mildly  short  gamma  for  the  owner,  as  well  as  a  short  delta. 

Figure  20.3  shows  the  nasty  effect  of time  near  the  barrier,  reminiscent 

of that  of an  American  binary. 

Figure  20.4  shows  the  effect  of time  on  a  reverse  KO  (100,105)  and  20.5 
shows  the  difference  with  an  American  binary:  below  100  the  trade  is short 
gamma,  therefore  will  earn  time  decay  (even  when  there  is no  carry). 

Case  Study:  The  Knock-Out  Box 

The  following  real-life  trade  (only  slightly  modified)  took  place  in  the  dol- 
lar  against  French  Franc. 

As  the  dollar  dropped  steadily  against  the  European  cfirrencies  during  the 
1990s,  many  French  corporate  treasuries  found  themselves  under  water  on 
their  speculative  positions.  It had  been  fashionable  in Parisian  circles  to  call 
the  turn  of  the  U.S.  currency  as  travelers  were  invoking  economic  equilib- 
rium  theories  and  other  notions  that  made  the  dollar  look  underpriced  in 
their  eyes.  It was  rare  for  this  author  to  enter  conversations  with  Parisians 
without  hearing  purchasing-parity  comparisons  such  as  the  cost  of a  com- 
pact  disk  sold  by  Chinatown  peddlers  and  the  exact  same  item  sold  at

Many  corporates  without  real  marks-to-market  rules  found  it easy  to  carry

Option  Wizard:  How  Bad  Salespeople  Fool  Their  Customers 

There  is  an  old  trick  bad  salespeople  use  to  fool  their  customers  into  trades 
that  generate  profits  for  their  employer  and  keep  them  in  the  game:  taking  ad- 
vantage  of  their  statistical  misperception.  It  is  easier  to  fool  someone  with  a 
distributional  confusion. 

Covered  Writes,  for  example,  allowed  brokers  to  kill  the  upside  of their  cus- 
tomers  and  generate  steady  flows  of commissions.  A  customer  is  long  the  stock 
and  sells  calls  against  it.  If the  customer  loses  money  on  the  calls,  the  broker 
could  argue  that  the  customer  made  money  on  the  stock.  Should  the  customer 
lose  money  on  the  stock,  the  broker  would  not  fail  to  point  out  that  the  customer 
was  spared  further  losses  thanks  to  the  income  brought  by the  calls. 

Until  customers  gained  in  sophistication,  covered  writes  were  the  best 
game  in  town.  As  customers  started  understanding a little  more  statistics,  the 
game  moved  to  the  fancier  exotic  options  payoffs.  The  distributional  confusion 
moved  to  the  notion  of path  dependency.

he  would  be  able  to  go  short  the  dollar  back  at  5.60  where  the  entire  matter 
would  be  closed.  The  trader  would  be  able  to  start  a  new  life  as  a  dollar  bull 
again  if he  so  wishes.  Great  trade.  It  sold  very  well,  like  a  Le  Monde  issue 
on  election  day. 

“Fair  value”  for  the  trade  using  a  Black-Scholes-Merton  type  valuation 
(one  constant  volatility)  shows  the  trade  to  be worth  .63%  at  11.5%  volatility, 
6%  domestic  U.S.  rates,  and  7%  French  rates. 

The  profile  of the  trade  by itself  is first  examined.  Figure  20.6  shows  the 
value  of a  5.60  put  on  the  dollar  (call  on  the  FRF)  KO  at  4.85,  with  one  year

Figure  20.8  shows  the  position  after.  A drop  in the  bucket,  one  may  say. 

It is enlightening  to  compare  it to  the  position  with  the  Salvation  Trade. 
So today  the  trade  does  not  do much  for  the  hapless  Frenchman.  Tomor- 
row,  however,  there  might  be  some  hope.  Look,at  the  profile  around  expira- 
tion  in Figure  20.8.  A zone  of break-even  can  be  seen  between  4.85  and  5.60 
on  the  overall  package  (less  the  premium  spent  on  the  Salvation  trade). 

Trading  Rule:  Some  institutions  fool  the  gullible  investors  by tak- 
ing advantage  of their  lack  of knowledge  of probability  theory,  and 
truncating  the  distribution  of  profits.  The  investors,  particularly 
when  under  pressure,  tend  to  believe  in Santa  Claus.

But  there  is  some  hope. 

It does  not  improve  the  customer’s  condition  to  see  the  graph  in  Figure 

20.9.  But  the  broker  now  has a story  to  tell  in cases  of success  and  failure. 

Further  analysis  of  the  trade  shows  that  the  reason  such  protection  is 
cheap  is  precisely  because  its  first  exit  time  is  very  short.  The  trade  is  en- 
tirely  dominated  by the  barrier,  so  the  odds  of the  5.60  put remaining  an  op- 
tion  are  very  low. 

With  time,  the  value  of the  option  would  increase,  and,  should  (for  some 
reason)  the  market  become  stationary,  the  structure  would  look  like  a  real 
protection.  Such  an  event  has  an  infinitely  small  probability  of surviving  the 
next  year.  The  salesperson  would  show  the  customer  the  pictures  in  Figures 
20.9  and  20.10  but  would  fail  to  tell  him  that  such  a  picture  represents  not  the 
expiration  P/L  like  a  regular  option  but  shows  the  P/L  if  USD-FRF  never 
trades  below  than  4.850001.  There  is a  massive  difference  between  a  path  in 
dependent  expiration  P/L  and  a  path-dependent  one.  Most  customers  have 
not  been  trained  nor  are  they  used  to  looking  at  such  graphs  properly. 

Finally,  the  positive  time  decay  from  the  trade,  provided  the  USD-FRF 

remained  totally  frozen,  shows  in  Figure  20.11. 

Option  Wizard:  Fooled  by the  Expiration  Profile 

The  expiration  profile  is a  great  way  to  delude  a  potential  customer  into  enter- 
ing  a  good  trade  (good  for  the  seller).  It  has  already  been  established  that  the 
statistical  sense  of  people  is  rather  weak,  even  in  the  examination  of a  regular 
risk  profile. 

When  looking  at  a  path-dependent  profile  “at  expiration,”  the  customer 
may  not  realize  that  he  has  mentally  correct  for  the  payoff  probabilities.  This  is 
difficult  when  the  report  is  made  to  look  like  a  static  payoff  with  a  small  men- 
tion  at  the  bottom.

Note:  This  example  does  not  take  into  account  that  a  trader  who  lost  $12 
million  would  incur  interest  charges  on  the  losses.  In  fact,  some  trades  es- 
cape  such  treatment  but  are  penalized  by their  not  getting  any  interest  on 
their  profits. 

Some  customers  after  a  while  could  come  back  and  tell  their  salesper- 
son  that  perhaps  the  trade  might  not  always  work  fn  all  circumstances. 
They  may  be  paying  $800,000  (actually  the  bank  might  be  charging  them 
up  to  $1,000,000  for  the  trade  under  the  illusion  that  every  penny  above 
Black-Scholes-Merton  value  is  profits)  just  to  buy  a  butterfly.  So  here  is 
the  answer. 

Making  the  Trade  Debit-Free. 
By entering  the  trade  for  no  debit,  or  per- 
haps  a  small  credit,  the  customer  might  complain  very  little  in  the  event  of 
being  knocked-out  of the  trade.  So the  new  idea  is to  perform,  in addition  to 
the  “Great  Salvation,”  a  covered  write. 

The  customer  can  thus,  at  no  cost,  keep  performing  the  trade  until  the 
day, way  down  the  road,  when  he would  break  even.  A statistician  can  prob- 
ably estimate  that  day to  be a  few  hundred  years  away.

To  turn  the  trade  into  a  debit  trade,  the  dealer  could  make  the  gullible 
customer-underwater  sell  some  5.60  dollar  calls  for  some  premium.  This 
is  the  late  1990s,  however,  and  this  kind  of  trade  belongs  to  the  preexotic 
structures  of  earlier  days.  Moreover,  the  customer  could  then  decompose 
the  trade  by himself,  trade  it on  his  own  and  deprive  them  of the  profits.  Fi- 
nally,  then,  should  the  customer  sell  a  5.60  call  on  the  dollar,  the  structure 
could  cause  a  problem  in  the  event  of  the  KO  being  terminated  and  the 
other  leg staying  naked  to  prevent  the  renewal  of the  structure. 

What  to  do  then?  The  package  could  include  a  call  knock-out  that 
would  vanish  also  at  4.85.  The  no-debit  rule  can  be  achieved.  In  addition, 
the  trader  could  even  get  some  cushioning  income  from  it.  The  terms 
would  be  as  follows: 

Length:  one  year.  Customer  buys  5.60  put  on  dollar  KO  4.85,  sells  5.60 
call  on  dollar  KO  4.85  for  no  premium.  Should,  at  the  end  of  the  1.5 
years,  the  dollar  stay  above  4.75,  the  customer  would  get  back  his  $12 
million  losses. 

However,  should  the  structure  be  knocked  out,  which  means  that  the 
dollar  dropped  below  4.85,  the  trader  would  have  his  global  position  lose 
even  more  money.  That,  the  derivatives  house  would  not  mention. 

What  in  effect  the  customer  was  led  to  do  was  truncating  his  distribu- 
tion,  cutting  off  any  hope  of making  money  back  against  the  possibility  of 
keep  trying  the  trade  forever,  until  he  can  spend  one  entire  year  without 
hitting  a  barrier. 

Figure  20.12  shows  the  profile  of  the  entire  package  at  expiration.  The 
principal  difference  between  Figure  20.12  and  Figure  20.9  is that,  above  the 
barrier  of 485,  Figure  20.12  shows  perfect  breakeven.

Hedging  Reverse  Knock-Outs:  A  Graphical  Case  Study 

Reverse  knock-outs  are  principally  difficult  to  hedge.  The  following  case 
study  will  examine  the  reverse  knock-out  from  the  vantage  point  of  the 
trader  and  illustrate  the  possible  hedges.  The  presentation  will  go  through 
the  Greeks  and  examine  their  relevance—or  lack  of it. 

The  trade  will  be  examined  from  the  standpoint  of the  seller  of the  op- 

tion,  and  it will  be hedged  step  by step. 

The  trader  sells  $100  million  of  one-year  5.60  dollar-put  FRF  call  for 

$800,000,  with  a  KO  feature  at  4.85,  only  3%  away  from  the  market. 

The  Deltas. 
The  operator  is short  calls  but  an  inexperienced  trader  might 
be  surprised  to  see  the  deltas  move  from  positive  to  negative.  This  occurs 
because  close  to  the  barrier  the  option  structure  weakens  and  is dominated 
by the  bet.  The  trade  becomes  cheaper  as  the  market  approaches  the  barrier. 
Close  to  the  other  end,  however,  the  trade  becomes  cheaper  again  as  it re- 
sembles  a  long  put  in  a  rally.  In  between  the  two  poles,  the  trade  could  be 
somewhat  confusing. 

The  delta  is  expressed  in  percentage  of  face  value  (in  dollars,  not  cur- 
rencies).  Figure  20.13  shows  the  changes  in  the  delta  8f the  structure.  The 
reader  can  see  the  drop  from  the  cliff  at  the  barrier  price  of 4.75. 

As  time,  however,  moves  closer,  the  delta’  would  give  a  little  bit  of 

heartbeat.  Look  at  it with  one  day to  go  (Figure  20.14). 

The  delta  one  day from  expiration  reaches  2000  level,  which,  for,  a  $100 
million  position,  will  represent  serious  deltas.  The  face  value  of the  position 
is  actually  larger  for  a  dollar-based  person  since  it  corresponds  to  being 
short  the  equivalent  of 100  million  FRF  at  5.6,  560  million  FRE,  which  would 
be  by  the  two-country  paradox  constant  FRF  but  at  4.85  would  turn

into  100  x  5.60/4.85  =  $115.4  million.  So  2000  deltas  would  be  20  times 
115.4  =  $231  billion.  The  intrinsic  value  of  the  option  would,  by the  same 
token,  be  worth  $15.5  million,  quite  an  impressive  time  decay  given  that  a 
year  before,  it  is  worth  just  between  $600,000  and  $800,000,  the  price  at 
which  the  traders  sold  it. 

Figure  20.15  shows  the  accelerated  changes  in  the  value  of  the  option 
from  the  passage  of  time.  In  trading,  acceleration  means  instability.  Such 
instability  increases  at  the  barrier,  provided  the  structure  does  not  knock- 
out  before  the  end  of its  life.  So  this  scenario,  while  perhaps  being  the  most 
beastly,  is  no  doubt  the  least  likely  of  all.  There  are  very  small  chances  for 
the  market  spending  one  year  near  a  barrier  without  touching  it. 

The  reader  will  find  in  Figure  20.16  two  possible  scenarios:  The  change 
in  value  at  a  USD-FRF  rate  of  4.76  (close  to  the  barrier)  and  at  5.55  (away

from  the barrier).  At 4.76  the  trade  undergoes  a harrying  negative  time  decay 
for  the  seller.  At  5.55,  however,  the  trade  decays  positively.  The  trader  exe- 
cutes  his  delta.  He  sold  the  KO  put  and  is therefore  long  dollars  (short  FRF). 
He  sells  dollars,  buys  FRF  against  the  position  in  19%  of the  dollar  value  (at 
5.00  the  dollar  value  is 100  X  5.60/5.00  =  $112  mil  so  19%  is $21.2  mil). 

Figures  20.17  through  20.23  will  examine  the  various  risks  assuming 
dynamic  hedging.  Figures  20.17  through  20.20  will  assume  delta  neutrality 
and  the  remaining  figures  will  assume,  in addition  to  delta  neutrality,  vega 
neutrality.  Given  the  difference  between  the  local  behavior  of  the  Greeks 
and  their  global  behavior,  the  graphs  will  examine  the  sensitivity  both 
using  a  microscope  (for  a  local  sensitivity  assuming  a  small  change  in  the 
parameters)  and  a  telescope  (assuming  large  changes). 

Figure  20.17  shows  the  delta  sensitivity  through  the  microscope,  in  the 
neighborhood  of a  USD-FRF  of 5.00.  It looks  like  simple  long  gamma,  with 
the  “V”  Shape  of  the  P/L.  Figure  20.18  shows  the  same  sensitivity  at  a

larger  scale,  with  a  jump  at  the  barrier.  Figure  20.18  shows  the  real  need  to 
liquidate  the  delta  hedge  at  the  barrier,  one  of the  problems  in  managing  a 
barrier  option. 

Gamma  and  Vega. 
Figure  20.19  shows  the  disturbing  gamma,  as  it is cen- 
tered  in  the  neighborhood  of 5.30  USD-FRF.  Figure  20.20  shows  now  that,  5 
week  from  expiration,  the  gamma  peaks  at  a  level  close  to  the  barrier,  and 
turns  negative  in  the  neighborhood  of 5.35.  The  difference  between  Figure 
20.19  and  Figure  20.20  represents  the  reason  traders  are  scared  of  reverse 
knock-out  options,  since  they  cannot  be  trusted  to  retain  any  characteristic 
for  long. 

Before  looking  at  the  necessary  vega  hedges,  examine  the  stability  of 
the  measure.  Figures  20.21  and  20.22  show  the  position  at  current  spot.  Fig- 
ure  20.21  shows  the  volatility  sensitivity  of the  position  with  1 year  left  and

noticeable  that  both  the  vegas  and  the  vega  convexity  increase  with  time  to 
expiration,  in  the  neighborhood  of the  barrier. 

It is worthy  mentioning  that  the  vega  sign  is negative:  the  owner  is short 
vega.  The  trader  who  sold  the  option  will  have  to  sell  vega  to  offset  a  long 
volatility  position. 

By  looking  at  the  gamma  sheet  for  immediate  moves,  the  trader  would 
notice  that  the  gamma  peaks  at  around  5.30.  So  will  the  vega  (for a  single  op- 
tion  gamma  and  vega  peak  at  the  same  level).  So  the  trader  will  sell  an  option 
that  peaks  around  that  level.  The  trader  selects  a  3-month  option  struck 
around  USD-FRF  of  5.30,  which  leaves  him  with  a  vega-neutral  position. 
Figure  20.23,  which  is a  graph  of the  vega  combination,  shows  that  vega  neu- 
trality  will  be very  transitory  for  the  next  move. 

It is never  pleasant  for  traders  to  be  in  a  situation  where  the  vega  of  the 
position  increases  when  volatility  comes  down  and  decreases  in  a  rally.  It 
means  that  vega  neutrality  will be a  sure  loser. 

Figure  20.24  shows  the  vega  of  the  structure  unhedged  across  spot 
across  volatility  levels.  Comparing  Figure  20.24  to  Figure  20.23  would  cer- 
tainly  show  it  to  be  more  favorable.  Perhaps,  after  all,  it  would  have  been 
better  to  avoid  selling  the  3 month  options  as  a  hedge. 

Finally,  Figure  20.25  shows  the  hedged  exposure  across  the  exchange 
rate  moves,  to  show  that  not  just  the  volatility  changes  can  bother  the  vega, 
but  spot  moves  as  well. 

To  conclude  the  case  study,  perhaps  it  would  have  been  better  to  leave 
the  trade  without  a  vega  hedge.  As  a  trader  the  author  prefers  a  dangerous 
trade  left  roughly  wnhedged  than  accurately  mishedged.

DOUBLE  BARRIER  OPTIONS 

Double  barrier  options  are  structures  that  expire  when  either  of  the  two 

one-dimensional  option),  there  can  only  be  two  barriers,  one  higher  than 
the  market  and  another  one  lower.  With  multidimensional  options,  there 
could  only be  twice  as  many  barriers  as  dimensions. 

Figure  20.26  compares  the  value  of a  double  barrier  with  that  of a  simple 
barrier.  In both  cases  the  option  is a  1 year  call  struck  at  100.  The  single  bar- 
rier  has  an  upper  outstrike  at  110  while  the  double  barrier  has  an  upper  out- 
strike  at  110  and  a  lower  one  at 90. 

The  following  are  basic  rules  about  double  barriers: 

¢  Typically,  the  first  exit  time  is so  short  that  the  underlying  option’s 
characteristics  will  be of little  relevance.  At best,  the  structure  would

look  like  a  reverse  knockout.  At  the  worst,  it would  seem  to  want  to 
expire  imminently. 

¢  Consequently,  the  best  way  to  study  them  is  to  examine  American 

double  bets. 

Rebate 

The  rebate  is  a  simple  American  binary  option  that  pays  a  certain  sum  on 
the  termination  of the  barrier.  A knock-out  option  with  a  rebate  is therefore 
a  straight  knock-out  plus  an  American  bet  of the  same  strike. 

Suppose  that  a  reverse  knock-out  call  of strike  100  and  knock-out  trig- 
ger  109  paid  $9  on  termination.  The  structure  will  simply  be  additive:  one 
knock-out  call  100  trigger  109  plus  one  $9 face  value  bet,  which  means  that 
the  bet  pays  $9 if the  trigger  109  is reached  at  any  point  during  its  life. 

Exercise:  Adding  the  Knock-In 

The  reader  should  try,  as  an  exercise,  to  repeat  the  study  with  knock-in  op- 
tions,  using  the  methodology  of the  comparison  between  regular  knock-out 
and  regular  knock-in  options. 

Alternative  Barrier  Options 

These  are  also  called  outbarrier  options.  They  belong  to  both  the  path-de- 
pendent  and  correlation  families of exotic options. 

A  trader  may  have  an  option  on  one  asset  with  a  barrier,  typically  a 

knock-out,  in  another  one. 

xample:  A  SCUD,  a  second  currency  underlying,  is  an  option  on 
one  asset  in  one  currency  with  a  barrier  struck  on  the  exchange  rate. 

364 

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

Examples  are  a  Deutsche  mark  cap  with  a  dollar-mark  barrier,  or  a 
Nikei  Index  put option  with  a  knock-out  on  a  lower  dollar  yen. 

The  SCUD  assumes  that  the  customer no longer  needs  the  option 
protection  when  the  price  of the  asset  moves  in such  a  way  as  to  create  a 
profit  from  the  currency  alone. 

ay  that  a  dollar-based  fund  is long Japanese  stocks.  A lower  dollar, 
tronger  yen  would  be  sufficient  to  create  a  profit.  He  can  simply  pur- 
chase  a  protection  against  an  adverse  movement  in  the  Japanese  market 
that  terminates  if  the  currency  appreciates.  Should  the  option  termi- 
nate,  the  investor  can  then  unwind  the  entire  package  for  a  profit. 

Another  example  is for  a  U.S.-based  investor  to borrow  in short-term 
DM  and  roll  over  his  borrowing  periodically.  He  can  buy  a  cap  for  his 
borrowing  but  with  a  knock-out  should  the  DM  depreciate.  In  the  event 
of his  being  knocked  out,  he  will  be  able  to  satisfy  his  short-term  DM 
liability  by buying  back  the  currency  for  a  profit. 

The  following  are  key trading  issues: 

e  The  correlation  between  assets  makes  the  alternative  barrier  resem- 
ble  a  regular  one.  Independence  makes  the  barrier  become  a  bet  on 
the  other  option. 

¢  The  structure  will  end  up  having  two  correlated  deltas,  one  positive 
in  the  asset  A  and  one,  on  the  opposing:  side  of  the  barrier,  for  the 
asset  B  in  which  the  barrier  is  struck  (see  Chapter  22,  “Multiasset 
Options”). 

The  Exploding  Option 

ye: option  is one  that  presents  a  certain  payout  if and  when a cer- 
tain  price  is reached  between  the  initiation  and  maturity.  It is  said  then  to 
V4 
"explode." 

Assume  that  the  underlying  is trading  at  100.  A 102  call  “exploding”  at 
107  pays  5 points  when  107  is  touched.  It  offers  an  alternative  to  a  call 
spread  or  a  put  spread  since  the  owner  of  the  exploding  option  can  thus 
take  profits  without  having  to  incur  transaction  costs.  The  drawback  of 
such  an  option  is  that  should  the  owner  change  his  mind  about  the  posi- 
tion  before  expiration,  the  spread  costs  would  be  greater  than  those  of  a 
regular  option. 

An  exploding  option  is equivalent  to  a  reverse  knock-out  with  a  rebate 

equal  to  the  exploding  payoff  at  the  time  of the  termination  of the  option. 

Figures  20.27  and  20.28  show  the  difference  between  a  regular  call  and 
an  exploding  option.  The  regular  call  is  struck  at  100  while  the  exploding 
option  is  struck  at  100  and  terminates  at  105.  Figure  20.27  considers  a  ter- 
mination  payoff  of 2 while  Figure  20.28  considers  a  payoff  of 10.

Capped  Index  Option 

_ Gapped index  option,  called  CAPs,  is best  described  as  a  reverse  knock-out 
that  pays  a  rebate  on  termination  equal  to  the  difference  between  strike  and 
outstrike.  It is  made  to  appear  to  be  a  call  spread  or  put  spread  that  offers  a 
payout  equal  to  the  difference  between  the  two  strikes.  One  other  intricacy  is 

366 

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

that  unlike  most  knock-outs  that  are  triggered  if touched,  this  one  needs  the 
settlement  price  (in some  cases)  to  be at or  through  the  second  strike. 

APs  are  different  from  exploding  options  in  that  they  are  only  termi- 
ted  at  the  official  closing  price  of the  asset  while  the  exploding  option  is 
commonly  knocked  out  at  any  time.  It is then  said  to  explode.  As  explained 
in Chapter  18, the  at-settlement  options  act  like  American  binaries  (1.e.,  mo- 
notonously  long  or  short  vega)  except  close  to  expiration  day when  they be- 
come  European  and  can  thus  present  mixed  gamma  features. 

Figure  20.29  compares  the  P/L  value  of  the  CAPs  100-105 
Example: 
(i.e.,  a  100/105  capped  call  spread)  with  that  of a  regular  call  struck  at 
100  with  the  market  at  100.  The  initial  purchase  price  of the  CAP  is 2.72 
compared  with  3.11  for  a  regular  call.  Assume  that  volatility  is  15.7% 
annualized. 

CAPs  are  commonly  difficult  to  trade  compared  with  other  structures  be- 
cause  they  only  terminate  if the  underlying  assets  go through  the  settlement 
price,  regardless  of what  can  happen  during  the  trading  day.  While  this  fea- 
ture  may  appear  of small  consequence  to  the  nonhedging  user,  it carries  some 
significant  risks  or  some  significant  opportunities  to  the hedger. 

In  a  traditional  barrier  option,  the  trader  knows  exactly  when  to  un- 
wind  his  hedge.  When  a  market  maker  is short  the CAP  and  has  a  position 
in  the  underlying  asset  against  it, he  would  work  an  order  close  to  his  CAP 
price.  In  an  ordinary  barrier,  he  would  get  out  of his  hedge  at  close  to  the

Option  Wizard:  The Legality  of the  Triggering 

Operators  often  disagree  on  what  constitutes  an  incontrovertible  termination 
of a  barrier  structure.  If a  trader  owns  a  knock-out  option  that  was  terminated 
according  to  the  counterparty,  he  would  like  to  see  clear  signs  that  the  market 
earnestly  traded  there  without  manipulation. 

Manipulation  is  possible  (some  say  likely)  in  illiquid  over-the-counter  mar- 
kets.  Listed  exchanges  do  have  a  procedure  in  place  for  preventing  two  traders 
from  consummating  a  trade  at  a  fictitious  price.  A trade  cannot  be  recorded  at 
a  price  lower  than  existing  bids  or  higher  than  existing  offers.  Such  protection 
is  not  afforded  by the  over-the-counter  traders  who  do  not  have  a  centralized 
place  to  exchange  contracts. 

The  need  for  such  protection  caused  banks  and  dealers  to  establish  elabo- 
rate  contracts  specifying  that  the  barrier-triggering  conditions  would  be  met  only 
with  a  proof  of the  trade  on  more  than  an  independent  forum  (i.e.,  more  than 
one  broker).  Some  firms  are  usually  unhappy  about  such  terms.  They  consider 
that  a  market  if touched  condition  would  be  preferable,  as  in  the  heat  of the  bat- 
tle,  it would  be  impossible  to  predict  whether  the  option  was  knocked  out  if the 
operator  has  to  wait  to  gather  information  on  the  number  of times  it traded  and 
where.  The  operator  needs  certainty.  Knowing  immediately  whether  he  has 
been  knocked  out  is  of  the  utmost  significance.  Having  to  wait  for  the  proof 
might  be  costly  as  the  information  lag causes  slippage. 

The  best  solution  is  to  require  the  bank  short  the  knock-out  (or  long  the 
knock-in)  to  leave  a  stop-loss  with  a  designated  list  of  third  parties  (consid- 
ered  reputable  from  both  sides).  Thus  the  party  long  the  barrier  (i.e.,  having  to 
place  a  stop-loss  order  against  the  market  move  as  opposed  to  having a limit 
order)  can  satisfy  the  proof  that  the  barrier  was  triggered  with  a  simple  confir- 
mation  slip. 

knock-out  price  and  close  his  risk.  In  this  case,  he  does  not  know  the  exact 
price,  which  can,  ironically  give  rise  to  some  opportunity. 

Take  the  example  of  the  100/105  CAPs  structure.  The  trader  is  short 
$100  million  and  long  $48  million  of  the  underlying  asset.  At  the  105 
knock-out  price,  the  market  maker  has  his  delta  change  from  48%  to  zero 
instantaneously.  But  should  that  happen  during  the  day,  the  trader  will 
not  know  whether  to  cover  entirely  by  selling  back  the  $48  million.  He 
could  sell  a  portion  of it and  wait  to  see  whether  the  market  goes  higher,  in 
which  case  he  could  sell  the  balance  at  a  higher  price  if  he  gains  confi- 
dence  that  the  structure  would  be  terminated.  Should  the  market  head 
lower  through  the  barrier  he  could  buy  back  the  hedge  for  a  profit,  and 
hope  for  a  repeat  of the  operation.  So  in  this  example,  the  trader  has  an  in- 
valuable  option  in  his  hand.

Option  Wizard;  Barriers  and  Price  Manipulation 

There  are  famous  cases  of  traders  defending  their  barriers,  as  with  the  well 
publicized  case  of the  Venezuelan  par  bonds.  One  firm  owning  knock-in  puts 
allegedly  tried  to  buy  massive  amounts  of the  bond  to  satisfy  the  trigger  condi- 
tions  while  the  party  short  the  puts  left  massive  sell  orders  to  prevent  the  price 
from  going  through  the  limit.  A  flash  screen  update  caused  one  party  to  con- 
sider  that  the  option  was  knocked  in  while  the  counterparty  thought  otherwise. 
The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  was  alerted  by the  abnormal 
trading  volume  and  its  concentration  among  few  players. 

The  lesson  from  such  an  event  is  that  in  an  illiquid  market  the  seller  of 
the  barrier  option  (i.e.,  the  party  benefiting  from  the  hitting  and  therefore 
leaving  a  stop  order)  can  easily  manipulate  markets  with  quantities  small 
enough  to  make  such  manipulation  worthwhile.  The  payoff  at  the  barrier  is 
large  enough  to  make  the  risks  of  the  attempt  of  triggering  it very  small  in 
comparison.  According  to  the  contamination  principle,  this  represents  no 
less  than  a  free  option. 

There  are  similar  situations  with  cash-settled  options  where  small  buying  a 
few  minutes  prior  to  expiration  can  lead  to  massive  profits,  without  the  penalty 
of the  slippage  in  getting  out  of the  trade. 

¥ 

Lesson:  One  should  never  get  involved  in  a  knock-out  option  in  an  illiquid 

market  unless  one  gets  proper  compensation  for the  risk  of  liquidity  holes. 

The  example  shows  that  the  owner  of the  structure  would  be  at  a  disad- 

vantage  if he  engaged  in  dynamic  hedging. 

READING  A  Risk  MANAGEMENT  REPORT 

This  section  includes  the  following  material: 

e  A  report  on  the  way  Greeks  are  commonly  disclosed  to  trading  risk 

managers. 

e  Examples  of the  Greeks  as  treated  (or mistreated)  by a  conventional 

risk  management  system. 

e  Anexample  of the  pin risks  at  the  barrier. 
e  An  opportunity  through  the  gap  report  to examine  the  difference  be- 

tween  mined  and  clear  markets. 

The  discussion  of the  barrier  option  risk  precedes  the  introduction  of a 
standard  risk  management  report  (i.e.,  the  kind  used  by  banks’  risk 

Barrier  Options  (II) 

369 

management  departments  in  their  daily  monitoring  of the  risks).  Because 
few  institutions  today  have  positions  without  barriers,  the  author  believes 
in holistic  risk  management:  Have  all  possible  positions  on  one  underlying 
cumulated  in one  report. 

Risk  managers  get  a  hint  of  the  risks  of  a  particular  position  through 
common  scenario  analysis  reports  showing  the  sensitivity  of the  options  to 
ajl manners  of parameters.  The  principal  such  report  is the  spot  sensitivity. 
It outlines  the  risks  of P/L  stemming  from  the  changes  in asset  price. 

Note  that  some  firms  generate  “shadow”  reports  (i.e.,  showing  Shadow 
gamma,  as  defined  in  Chapter  8) while  others,  unfortunately,  limit  them- 
selves  to  straight  reports. 

The  risk  reports  of straight  option  positions  are  simple  to  look  at  as  the 
risk  manager  does  not  need  to  make  any  assumption  about  the  potential  ac- 
tions  of traders.  With  barrier  options,  managers  need  to  consider  the  risks 
of execution  of hedges  on  hitting  the  strike. 

Two  reports  are  included  in this  section:  One  takes  into  account  the  liq- 
uidation  of a  barrier  option  position  (Figure  20.30),  and  the  other  does  not 
(Figure  20.31).  The  example  will  illustrate  some  of the  concepts  we  covered 
and  will  show  the  variety  of  risks  faced  by risk  managers  in  dealing  with 
explosive  products.  For  the  sake  of  simplicity,  the  position  only  contains 
one  delta-neutral  position  in  a  flat  drift  flat  term  structures  of  volatility 
environment. 

It is assumed  that  the  Syldavian  currency  trades  at  SYD  1.00  to  the  dol- 
lar  (the  report  will  show  100  as  per  reporting  convention).  The  trader  has 
only  one  position  in his  inventory:  He  is short  100  million  dollar  equivalent 
of the  3-month  call  on  SYD  put  on  the  USD  struck  at  105.00  with  a  knock- 
out  feature  at  97.00.  Typically,  traders  can  carry  positions  with  thousands 
of strikes,  but  there  is no  loss  of generality  from  studying  an  exposure  with 
a  small  number  of positions. 

The  report  provides  the  following  information:

sued  from a database  audited  by the  controllers.  It signifies  that  the  re- 
port  produced  can  be  read  but  cannot  be  altered  by the  trader,  on  a 
read-only  mode.  The  trader  cannot  (in theory)  hide  positions  and  take 
risks  that  do not  show  on  the  report. 

¢  Barrier:  Analytic. 

The  pricing  of  the  barrier  options  is  performed 
on  a  simple  model  without  any  attempt  at  using  more  sophisticated 
tools.  Analytic  means  that  the  system  uses  a  closed-form  solution.

servedly  missing  because  of the  narrowness  of the  field  on  the  report). 
Indicates  that  a binomial  model  is implemented  for  American  options. 
The  field  Iterations  item  shows  90 O/E,  which  means  that  the  tree  will 
have  90  iterations  but  will  flip  between  odd  and  even  as a precision 
optimizing  trick. 
¢  Barrier:  ON  or  OFF. 

This  is where  the  beef  is:  Some  reports  assume 
that  the  trader  has  a  stop-loss  to  unwind  the  hetige  at  the  barrier  (in 
this  case,  35  mil  SYD  at 97.00),  and  Report  2 with  the  flag ON  makes 
such  assumption.  Typically,  if the  stop-loss  is  triggered,  the  trader 
has  a  documented  proof  that  the  market  traded  at  such  level  as  re- 
quired  by the  contract  and  finished  off  the  option.  So  it appears  safe 
that,  conditional  upon  a  firm  order  in  the  market,  the  risk  manager 
would  be interested  in seeing  the  rest  of the  position  post-stop-loss. 

Matters  are  not  that  easy,  however:  What  if the  barrier  stop-loss  was  not 
executed  at  the  desired  price?  There  is  the  nefarious  slippage,  as  defined  in 
Chapter  4.  Beyond  that,  there  might  be  the  more  severe  gap  risk:  the  discon- 
tinuous  moves  as  the  market  can  snap  through  the  barrier,  thus  causing  liqui- 
dation  at  lower  than  97.00.  Every  point  lower  would  cost  $3.5  million  dollars 
in execution  costs.  This  shows  the  need  for  another  risk  report,  the  gap  risk. 
Traders  assume  that  markets  in foreign  exchange  trade  on  a  24-hour  basis,  but 
there  is  the  risk  of  the  discontinuity  caused  by  the  weekend.  In  addition, 
there  are  political  announcements  that  can  cause  such  gap  risks:  The  news 
that  the  Syldavian  king has  some  cardiovascular  problems  can  hit the  screens, 
thus  causing  a  large  and  sudden  gapping  drop  in the  currency. 

Many  risk  managers  suggested  to  the  author  that  the  stop-loss  be 
placed  before  the  official  knock-out  trigger  (slightly  higher  than  a  lower 
barrier  and  slightly  lower  than  a  higher  barrier).  This  is a bad  idea  as  it cre- 
ates  a  negative  gamma  should  the  barrier  not  be  reached  (a phenomenon 
commonly  called  a  “bounce”  by traders  trying  to  defend  their  barriers). 

Barrier  Options  (II) 

373 

At  another  level,  banks  would  be  choked  with  risk  and  stopped  from 
trading  unless  they eliminated  the  triggered  barriers  from  the  risk  reports. 
Unlike  the  regular  short  option  gamma,  the  barrier  is  a  one-time  hit,  not  a 
permanent  danger.  Assume  that  the  trader  sold  the  $3.5  million  SYD  on 
a  stop-loss  basis.  The  trade  confirmation  would  be the  proof that  the  barrier 
was  knocked  out.  Should  the  market  rally  higher  or  continue  dropping,  the 
position  would  not  exist  at  all. 

The  best  solution  for  a  risk  manager  is to  have  Report  2 with  the  barrier 
stop-loss  ON  (not  Report  1 with  the  stop-loss  OFF)  as  well  as  a  gap  report 
showing  the  potential  execution  risks. 

This  risk  management  issue  illustrates  why  dynamic  hedgers  often  go 
through  the  difficult  task  of trying  to  explain  the  P/L  swings  to  their  boss. 
The  “I  thought  you  were  hedged”  is  an  answer  by  managers  unfamiliar 
with  the  product  (or  too  burned  out  to  try  to  learn  about  it)  and  the  best 
remedy  is the  gap  risk  report. 

Risk  Management  Rule: 
Traders  and  managers  need  to  make 
a  clear  distinction  on  a  report  between  the  contractually  path- 
dependent  positions  (i.e., barriers)  and  the  securities  that  are  path 
dependent  owing  to  dynamic  hedging  (vanilla  options). 

A brief  explanation  of the  report  columns  follows: 

e  P&L  (column  2)  shows  the  profits  from  the  origin  (Center  on  top 
shows  100).  It  assumes  no  shadow  gamma,  no  changes  in  volatility. 
To  compute  the  shadow  gamma  resulting  P/L,  one  needs  to  make  as- 
sumptions  about  the  volatility  behavior  conditional  on  a  move.  As- 
sume  the  trader  thinks  that  at  102  the  volatility  would  be  (for  the 
period  concerned)  one  point  higher,  an  extremely  safe  assumption. 
Being  that  he  is  short  modified  vega  (the  same  as  simple  vega)  in 
the  amount  of  $139,000  per  point  the  P/L  at  102  would  then  be 
—  644,000  —139,000  =  —$783,000  at  such  spot  level. 

¢  Gamma  in  this  report  is  conventional  except  that  it blows  up  at  the 
barrier  where  it becomes  a  Dirac.  The  report  shows  an  error  sign. 
¢  The  modified  vega  (expressed  in  100  not  1,000  for  reasons  of conven- 
tion)  assumes  curve  shifts  that  are  weighted  in  3-month  equivalent. 
Whatever  amount  is seen  corresponds  to  the  3-month  move  with  the 
previous  month a function  of it, according  to  some  empirical  observed 
weightings.  It assumes  the  move  to  be  one  point  in  the  3-month,  .5 in 
the  1-year,  and  so  on.  Because  the  model  is using  an  analytical  model 
in  place  of  the  Dupire-Derman-Kani,  it  is  safe  to  assume  that  the 

374 

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

modification  will  not  be  very  precise  for  a  barrier  since  the  barrier  re- 
acts  to  the  entire  curve. 

e  Rhod  shows  the  exposure  to  parallel  shifts  in  the  numeraire  cur- 
rency  and  Rhof  shows  the  shifts  in the  countercurrency.  Both  are  un- 
weighted,  an  extremely  bad  idea.  Rhod  is higher  than  rhof  because  it 
includes  the  exposure  to  the  carry  of the  premium. 

Gaps  and  Gap  Reports 

™  The  gap  report  shows  and  quantifies  the  possible  execution  risks  of the 
gap  delta  (the  deltas  that  need  to  be  unloaded  on a stop-loss  on  the  ter- 
mination  of the  structure).  These  are  one-time  slippage  costs. 

The  second  column  of  the  gap  report  shown  in  Figure  20.32  shows  the 
amount  of deltas  that  need  to be sold  at 97.00.  The  system  at  the  Credit  Bank 
of Syldavia  estimated  the  gap  risk  to  be  on  weekdays  $634,000  (Column  3), 
which  corresponds  to  a  gap  of .20  (the  risk  of having  the  order  filled  on  av- 
erage  at 96.80)  and  three  times  such  amount  when  the  market  gaps  over  the 
weekend  (Column  4). 

‘ 

The  magnitude  of the  gap  risk  is a  function  of the  number  of options  and 
will  remain  independent  of  the  duration  of  the  portfolio  or  stopping  time. 
Moreover,  the  market  has  a  tendency,  after  a  period  of  high  volatility,  of 
cleaning  up  some  range  in the  market  of stop-losses.  This  often  has  some  se- 
rious  impact  on  volatility.  It suggests  the  notion  of mined  markets. 

@  A  mined  market  is  one  that  has  many  knock-outs  and  knock-in  gap- 
delta  orders  placed  in  it  and  will  therefore  experience  a  high  level  of 
“whipping”  and  mean  reverting  volatility  around  these  prices.  A 
cleared  market  is one  that  has  no  such  orders  in  it. 

As  the  open  interest  in barrier  options  builds  up,  so  will  the  gap  orders  by 
operators.  Traders  monitor  the  recent  high and  low  (say for  one  month),  and 
when  such  difference  remains  narrow  for  a  few  weeks,  they  can  expect  the

buildup  of  gap  delta  orders  below  the  low  and  above  the  high.  As  soon  as 
the  market  enters  a  “mined”  zone,  a  chain  of  liquidity  holes  is  triggered. 
The  market  then  clears  out.  This  phenomenon  is  called  the  “driftwood  ef-_ 
fect”  as  all  barrier  option  orders  will  be  pushed  out  to  the  recent  high  and 
low  range  (see  Figure  20.33). 

Risk  Management  Rule: 
The  expected  slippage  costs  of  gap  deltas 
need  to  be  increased  when  the  risk  manager  has  adequate  informa- 
tion  to  conclude  that  their  level  is located  in a  densely  mined  market 
range.

Compound,  Choosers,  and 
Higher  Order  Options 

Hiring  an  option  trader  with  P/L  volatility  is the  most  common  manifestation  of a 
compound  option. 

Compound  options  are  options  that  deliver  another  option.  They  are  partic- 
ularly  present  in  the  extendible  option  variety  and  other  structures  where 
the  owner  of the  structure  has,  somewhere  along  the  way,  the  possibility  of 
extending  his  choice  against  the  payment  of a fee. 

Compound  options  are  extremely  sensitive  to  higher  derivatives  with  re- 

_traders  call  volatility  of volatility,  in addition 

to the second  moment  with  re- 
spect  to  volatility  (somewhat  related).  They  are  commonly  mispriced  because 
of that  effect.  More  than  regular  options,  they  depend  on  the  thickness  of the 
tails  of the  distribution{This  makes  a  constant  volatility  type  model,  written 
in  early  days,  dangerous  to  use.)This  chapter  also  gives  warning  of  a  more 
complex  modeling  technique  that  includes  the  volatility  of volatility  owing  to 
the  difficulties  in both  its  estimation  and  its  association  with  the  underlying 
price  behavior. 

At  the  time  of  this  writing,  there  is  no  known  formula  nor  publicly 
available  method  to  price  compound  options  correctly  (using  stochastic 
volatility),  other  than  a  few  numerical  techniques  this  author  dabbled  with. 
So  in  this  presentation,  the  author  will  use  what  poor  formula  is  available 
and  try to  work  around  it by estimating  the  appropriate  markup. 

7A compound  option,  or  second-order  option,  is an  option  on  a  European 
option.  It consists  in the  right to buy or  sell  a  European  option  (called  un- 
derlying  option)  of a  given  strike  and  maturity  for  a predetermined  price. 

Ac third-order option  is  an  option  on  a  compound  option,  and  so  forth.  A 
“Compound Spbou has ore tinal taken  aa nen cal ee 
(the  equivalent  to  a  vanilla).  In  addition,  it will  have  intermediate  strikes 
and  intermediate  dates.  So  a  second-order  option  will  be

VEGA  CONVEXITY:  THE  Costs  OF  DYNAMIC  HEDGING 

Vega  convexity  can  be  best  illustrated  with  the  following  case  study  (see 
Table  21.1).  The  underlying  option  has  tenure  of'2  years,  struck  at  100,  with 
a  flat  forward,  and  15%  volatility.  Assume  for  simplicity  that  the  volatility 
curve  is flat.  As  the  price  of the  option  is initially  8%,  the  trader  buys  a  16% 
out-of-the-money  call  on  the  call  and  hedges  it vega  neutral  in the  underly- 
ing security. 

To simplify,  assume  that  vega  neutrality  can  be done  without  the  adjust- 
ment  factors.  Adjustment  factors,  or  weightings,  add  nothing  to  the  exam- 
ple.  Figure  21.4  shows  the  instability  of vega  neutrality.  What  a  trader  gets

CHOOSER  OPTIONS 

Chooser  options  are  options  that  could  turn  into  either  a  put or  a  call  at 
some  predetermined  time. 

oe have  the  following  specifications: 

Simple  Chooser  (K,t, intermediate’  tinal) 
The  more  complex  “Gutspin”  Chooser  (K, K,,f,

with K the  strike  price,  t, s.rmediate  the  time  until  the  owner  of the  structure 
would  have  to  decide  on  whether  he  prefers  to  own  the  put or  the  call.  The 
“gutspin”  chooser  allows  for  two  strike  prices,  and  the  owner  would  cer- 
tainly  choose  the  one  that  is the  furthest  in the  money. 

A  European  chooser  option  that  has  the  intermediate  date  equal  to  the 
end  date  would  then  be  identical  to  a  straddle.  At  the  other  extreme,  a 
chooser  that  has  very  little  time  before  the  decision  deadline  would  be 
priced  at  the  highest  of the  put or  the  call. 

. 

Figure  21.5  shows  a  2-month  option  (strike  =  100,  no  drift)  with  a 
choosing  period  that  floats  between  the  immediate  need  for  a  decision  and 
a  time  to  decision  equal  to  the  end  date.  At  one  extreme,  as  the  choosing  pe- 
riod  is  equal  to  zero,  the  structure  will  be  priced  at  the  value  of a  2-month 
call  or  put  (they  are  equal  in  this  case).  At  the  other  it will  be  valued  at  the 
price  of the  straddle. 

onically,  the  chooser  resembles  a  rainbow  option  because  the  trader 
s  to  pick  one  of  two  assets.  It  reaches  its  maximum  (i.e.,  the  straddle 
price)  when  the  correlation  between  the  two  assets  (the  put  and  the  call)  is

go through  the  mental  exercise  of thinking  that  a  put and a call  are  two  neg- 
atively  correlated  assets. 

_ Figure  21.6  provides  a  pictorial  comparison  between  a  chooser  and  a 

straddle. 

There  are  few  interesting  things  to  say  about  the  chooser  except  that  it 
comes  halfway  between a vanilla  and  a  straddle\Its  sensitivity  to  volatility 
would  be  very  linear  when  it is at  the  money  and  more  convex  than  an  out- 
of-the-money  vanilla  as  it becomes  deep  in  the  money  (a chooser  has  the 
characteristic  or  never  being  out  of the  money  in the  simple  one-strike  case))

They  are  options  on  caps  and  options  on 
floors,  themselves  a  SDF  (smallest  decomposable  fragment)  sum  of  op- 
tions  on  independent  forward  Eurodeposit  (or other  form  of interest 
rates)  instruments  called  caplets  and  floorlets.  Hence,  captions  and 
floortions  are  options  on  baskets  (a basket  of Euros)  and  compound 
options  at  the  same  time.  The  first  characteristic  allows  traders  to 
use  covariance  matrices  in  the  analysis.  The  second  necessitates  a 
thorough  analysis  of the  volatility  of volatility. 

e  The  compound  element  in  captions  and  floortions  is not  remarkable, 
as  the  volatility  of the  basket  will  pull  down  that  of the  entire  struc- 
ture.  The  back  contracts  will  not  have  the  same  sensitivity  to  volatil- 
ity as  the  front  ones.  In  addition,  the  first  contract  will  not  be  very 
volatile. 

¢  The  multivariate  element  is not  as  dominating  as  with  regular  inter- 
est  rate  instruments.  The  correlation  between  the  prices  of  caplets 
and  floorlets  presents  more  stable  features  than  that  of the  underly- 
ing forward  Eurodeposits.

Multi-asset  options  range  from  the  basket  option  to  the  rainbow.  However, 
any  structure  in a pair not  involving  the  home  currency  as  a  numeraire  could 
be  interpreted  as  a  multiasset  option.  This  chapter  will  cover  the  essential 
risk  in most  of the  categories  but  will  focus  most  on  building  the  intuition  of 
their  risk  management  with  a  simplified  dual-asset  option  structure. 

Mathematicians  have  the  habit  of solving  problems  in  the  lower  dimen- 
sions,  then  generalizing  to  R".  The  reader  should  in the  same  fashion  gener- 
alize  structures  from  the  lower  into  the  higher  dimensions.  This  is  where 
the  quantitative  trading  starts:  While  pure  trader  judgment  and  intuition 
can  be  relied  on  in  the  lower  dimensions,  a more  mathematical  framework 
and  matrix  analysis  become  essential  in  the  higher  dimensions. 

Multiasset  structures  include: 

¢  Choice. 

Options  involving  a  choice  between  two  or  more  instru- 
ments:  best  of, worst  of,  rainbow  options,  etc.  A sample  will  be  ana- 
lyzed  with  the  rainbow  options. 

¢  Linear  Combinations. 

Options  involving  baskets,  spreads.  This  chap- 
ter  offers  a  brief  examination  of baskets.  Unlike  the  product  and  oth- 
ers,  a Sum  of two  exponential  Brownian  motions  is not  an  exponential 
Brownian.  These  instruments  resemble  Asian  options  in  the  sense 
that  they  will  present  some  pricing  complications  in  addition  to  some 
minor  skew  exposure  when  hedged  with  other  instruments. 

¢  Product  or  Quotients. 

Options  involving  a  product  between  two  or 
more  instruments.  They  are  easy  to  price,  often  more  difficult  to 
hedge.  The  chapter  includes  an  analysis  of a  sample  with  the  Mexi- 
can  structured  note. 

A  basic  understanding  of  the  risk  management  of  multiasset  options 
can  be  obtained  with  the  rainbow  option.  There  are  indeed  many  possible 

383 

384

structures  but  the  same  dynamic  hedging  method  applies  to  all  of  them, 
which  makes  it unnecessary  to  fill  up  a  phone  book  with combinations. 

CHOICE  BETWEEN  ASSETS:  RAINBOW  OPTIONS 

ot Rainbow  options  are  options  that  include  more  than  one  strike  price  on 

more  than  one  underlying  asset. 

They  are  usually  specified  as  having  one  expiration  date  and  a  payoff  that  is 
equivalent  to  the  largest  in-the-money  portion  of any  of the  strike  prices: 

Vee  (DIK pO  hp  wa  Kt) 

with ®, indicating  whether  it is a  put  or  a  call  (it could  be a call  on  asset  1 
and  a  put  on  asset  2) and  one  time  to  expiration  in  the  simple  case  (struc- 
turers  could  complicate  life  a  little  bit  by including  a  multiple  expiration 
date  structure). 

This  simple  example  shows  an  option  on  “either  or®  two  assets  A and  B, 
each  currently  trading  at  100,  with  two  strike  prices  of  100  for  asset  A and 
100  for  asset  B. The  reader  will  initially  consider'the  sensitivity  of the  struc- 
ture  with  30  days  to  expiration  then  will  extend  the  maturity  to  6 months 
for  a better  analysis.  Both  assets  trade  at  15.7%  volatility.  Assume  an  initial 
50%  correlation  between  the  two  assets. 

Note  that  one  could  rescale  the  assets  to  a  different  base  than  100  pro- 
vided  that  both  the  prices  and  the  strikes  are  multiplied  by  the  same 
amount. 

The  reader  can  intuitively  see  that  the  final  payoff  (Figure  22.1)  covers 
more  areas  than  either  of  the  two  options  each  taken  separately  but  some- 
what  less  than  the  sum  of  the  two  independent  options  (see  Figures  22.2 
and  22.3). 

Using  the  contamination  principle,  it is possible  to  see  that  the  price  of 
the  structure  with  time  until  expiration  would  look  like  an  inflated  balloon 
that  would  start  sticking  to  the  surface  of Figure  22.1  as  either  volatilities  or 
time  until  expiration  decrease. 

The  structure  is sensitive,  in  addition  to  the  usual  battery  of Greeks,  to 
correlation.  As  a  matter  of fact,  it has  a  correlation  vega,  usually  overlooked 
by researchers,  as  some  tend  to  write  off  correlation  as  constant,  owing  to 
improper 

training  in  the  physical  sciences. 

igure  22.4  displays  the  sensitivity  of  the  structure  to  correlation.  As 
rrelation  is bounded  between  —1  and  1, the  trader  does  not  have  to  simu- 
late  very  far  for  a  two-asset  option  structure.  For  a  higher  dimension  struc- 
ture,  the  trader  would  need  to  perform  the  more  difficult  matrix  analysis.

Sensitivity  of the  dual  strike  to  correlation. 

(At a  correlation  of 1, the  fact  that  the  option  has  two  assets  becomes  ir- 
relevant.  Because  the  two  assets  are  valued  at  the  same  volatility,  the  option 
structure  would  trade  at  the  price  of either  of the  two)If there  is  (for  some 
reason  attributable  to  the  cross-volatility  between  A and  B) a  difference  be- 
tween  the  volatilities  of the  assets,  the  structure  would  follow  the  highest  of 
the  two  volatilities. 

At a  correlation  of  —1,  the  structure  would  trade  at twice  the  value  of a 
regular  option because  it is guaranteed  to be in-the-money  in one  of the  two 
assets.  For  every  down-move  in one  asset,  the  operator  is guaranteed  an_an- 
tithetic  up-move  in the  other  so  one  of the  assets  would  be  in the  money. 

e.  This  example  uses  dual  call  options.  A  structure  with  a  call 

on 
oe and  a  put  on  the  other  (only  one  of  which  could  be  exercised  at 
maturity)  would  have  opposite  results:  negative  correlation  would  depress 
the  price. 

mA correlation  vega  for  a  dual  asset  structure  corresponds  to  the  change 
in price  in the  structure  that  results  from  a  change  in  correlation. 

wa a  multiasset  option  including  more  than  two  assets,  there  are  many  cor- 
relation  vegas,  one  for every  possible  pair.  So  for  a  structure  that  has 4 assets:

The  diagonal  is, of course,  0 since  every  asset  has  a  1 correlation  with  it- 
self.  Only  half  the  matrix  is  shown  because  the  correlations  are  mirror 
image  with  each  other  (correlation  between  asset  1 and  asset  2 will  be equal 
to  that between  asset  2 and  asset  1).

equivalent  of  a  volatility  being  negative,  something  even  experienced  op-

Correlated  and  Uncorrelated  Greeks 

(The dual  asset  option  presents  more  than  one  delta)and some  assumptions 
need to be made by the hedger  (Figure  22.5).  A believer  in the  stability  of cor- 
relations  would  necessarily  trade  the  structure  differently  from  a  conspiracy 
theorist.

Figure  22.6  shows  two  simulated  runs  for  asset  A.  One  varies  A  with- 
out  a  corresponding  correlated  move  in  asset  B  while  the  other  takes  B 
into  account. 

Asset  A  moving  alone  gives  a  different  result  than  when  the  asset  A 

move  is accompanied  by a  correlated  one  with  B. 

The  real  risk  then  needs  to be seen  in two  deltas,  A, and  A, as  well  as  in 
the  total  deltas.  It will  be  useful  to compare  the  deltas  a the  total structure. 
Table  22.1  shows  the  sensitivity  of the  option  partial  delta  A to  the  asset 

A  alone  (asset  B remains  frozen).

GammaBbB  =  Changes  in  the  A, stemming  from  the  changes  in B

Another  option  involving  choice  is the  outperformance  option. 

Man outperformance  option  (between  two  assets)  is an  option  that  entitles 
the  ‘owner  to buy or sell one asset  against  the  other  at  a  predetermined 
rate.  They  are  generally  calls  on  the  maximum,  puts  on  a  minimum.’ 

Outperformance  options  are  a  useful  tool  in  the  study  of  numeraire  issues. 
An  interesting  way  to  view  them  is with  index  allocation.  A fund  manager 
who  does  not  have  a  fixed  allocation  can  assume  that  he  has  a  theoretical 
delta  that  is similar  to  that  of such  option.  He  would  then  use  the  delta  vec- 
tors  and  gamma  matrices  to  continuously  adjust  his  position. 

390 

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

An  outperformance  option  can  easily  be  seen  as  a  spread  option  once  it 

is specified: 

Max(S1,  $2)  =  [S1  +-Max(0,  $2  —  S1)] 

which  means  that  an  outperformance  option  is nothing  but  one  asset  plus  a 
spread  between  two  of the  assets.  As  to  spread  options,  it is better  to  view 
them  from  the  vantage  point  of a  basket  by seeing  that  one  of the  assets  has 
a  negative  weight. 

Perhaps  the  mother  of  all  outperformance  options  is  the  option  on  the 
bond  future.  It entitles  the  short  future  party  to  deliver  the  cheapest  of the  el- 
igible  bonds.  As  such  it becomes  an  option  on  the  minimum  of several  assets. 

LINEAR  COMBINATIONS

cations:

\ the category  contains  basket  options,  spread  options,  and  any  combination 
one  would  dream  of.  In addition,  Asian  options  can  be  included  in it, as  will 
be  seen. 

Example 

e  With  n  =  2 and  w,  =  Ww,  =  1.  The  option  will  be a call,  put,  or  other 

(e.g.,  digital)  on  an  underlying  that  is the  sum  of two  assets.

¢  With  n  =  500  and  the  w, variable.  The  underlying  basket  would  be  a 

stock  index,  and  so  on. 

Linear  combinations  between  assets  pose  the  problem  of lognormality, 
which  does  not  occur  with  other  structures.  To  illustrate,  assume  that  as- 
sets  A and B are  both  lognormal:

It is  easy  to  see  that  the  sum  W  =  A  +B  cannot  be  put  in  a  geometric 

Brownian  shape 

W =  A,exp(  —  o,? At  +  a, VAt Z,) +  Bexp(  —%  a, At  +  o, VAt Z,) 

nor  would  W  =  A  —  B whereas  setting  W  =  AB,  results  in 

W  =  A,Bexp(  —%  (G2 +  a,7) At  +  (¢,Z,  +  o, Z,) VAD, 

or  if setting  W  =  A/B  gets 

W  =  A,/Bexp(—*%  (a, —  o,7)At  +  (¢,Z,  —  o,Z,)  V At), 

both  of which  are  geometric  Brownian. 

Basket  Options 

Basket  options  are options  on a weighted  sum  of two  or  more  assets.  They 
typically  have  a  strike  price  on  the  net  weighted  sum.  Basket  options  are 
Sere cence Ore merged  EORTC  a  basket  of  some 
subcomponent. 

These  options  will  not  receive  much  attention  here,  as  they can  be simply 
analyzed  as  options  on  a  product,  the  product  being  the  underlying  basket. 
Two  hitches—lognormality  and  the  correlation  between  the  underlying 
assets—represent  some  singularities,  however. 

Lognormality 

Problems  in hedging  basket  options  can  be  of some  significance  when  deal- 
ing with  markets  that  exhibit  a  strong  skew. 

operators  price  basket  options  as  if the  underlying  basket  were  a 
es on  its  own  following  a stochastic  process  similar  to that  of other 
commodities,  with  its  volatility  derived  from  its  own  time  series.  This,  how- 
ever,  conflicts  with  the  fact  that  an  average  (or  any  linear  combination)  of 
assets  with  a  lognormal  distribution  does  not  follow  a  lognormal  distribu- 
tion.  So  there  is  a  conflict  between  saying  that  the  SP100  components  are 
lognormal  and  that  the  SP100  as  a commodity  is.  In such  cases,  operators  re- 
sort  to  assuming  arbitrarily  that  the  most  traded  of the  basket  or  the  com- 
ponents  is going  to be  the  lognormal  product. 

This  problem  arises  in  swaps  and  Eurodollar  options.  It is well  known 
that  a  strip  is a basket  of Eurodollar  contracts  strung  together  and  weighted 
by some  discounting  factor.  An  option  on a strip  is  therefore  a  basket  op- 
tion.  Which  one  needs  to  be  lognormal? 

ee  eae,  factor  with  stock  indices  and  fixed  income  products  is that 
en  the  correlation  between  the  components  is high  the  sum  would  come 

closer  to  a  lognormally  distributed  asset. 

392

Example:

ing both  assets  A and  B would  be the  weighted  square  root  of the  volatil- 
ities  minus  correlation,  in  this  case  zero.  Therefore

with  w,  and  w,  the  weights  imparted  to  each  (a more  general  formula 
will  be  presented  in  the  next  section). 

Figure  22.7  graphically  displays  why  the  process,  the  volatility  of which 

is known,  is not  lognormal. 

Assume  no  drift  and  equal  weights  of .5, S,, and  S, both  initially  at  100 
and  50%  volatility.  So  the  operator  can  expect  the  resulting  sensitivity  of a 
position  that  is long  a  combination  of the  options  of the  assets  and  short  the 
basket  (in  ratio  satisfying  gamma  neutrality):  It  looks  like  a  risk  reversal. 
Figure  22.7  shows  such  position  at a  high volatility.  A more  acute  version  of 
this  problem  will  be  discussed  with  Asian  options. 

Correlation  Issues 

‘Vnoring 

a ee multiasset  structure  will  be  considered  on  n  underlying  securities.  Ig- 
the lognormality issue! the  operator  could  consider  the  structure  a 
pseudovanilla  option  and  price  it  by assuming  its  volatility  is  that  of  the 
basket.  To  derive  the  correlation  sensitivity,  he  would  reprice  the  structure 
at  different  levels  of  correlation.  This  is best  approximated  by multiplying 
the  vega  by the  effect  of the  correlation  on  the  volatility.

The  pseudovanilla  for  a  basket  is the  option  that  trades  at  the  net  volatility 

of the  basket.  It could  only  be  used  to  test  some  of the  sensitivities. 

A  pseudovanilla  for  a  barrier  is,  as  seen  earlier,  a  risk  reversal,  provided  one 
only  tested  for  the  skew  effect.  It could  also  be  (yes,  indeed),  a  calendar  spread, 
provided  one  tested  only  for  the  sensitivity  to  the  term  structure  of volatility. 

Before  gauging  the  effect  of  an  increase  in  any  of  the  volatilities  over 
the  overall  structure,  the  trader  must  get  some  formulas  updated  on  a 
spreadsheet. 

Assume  that  a  basket  S is  a  sum  using  the  individual  weights  w,  of as- 

sets  X, through  X_, that  is:

Rates  are  5%  for  the  USD,  5%  for  the  DEM  and  1%  for  the  JPY.  Note:  To 
compute  the  forward  of a  basket,  linear  weightings  of the  forwards  can 
be  used.  There  are  no  complications  (owing  to  the  homogeneity  of  the 
function)  as: 

Forward  (2w,S,,  t)  =  & w,  Forward  (S,, t). 

394 

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

Hence,  the  operator  can  ignore  the  forward  (taking  into  account  no 
shadow  gamma)  and  simply  use  spot  for  the  volatility  computation. 

The  6-month  volatilities  of USD-DEM  and  USD-JPY  are  11.85%  and 
11%  respectively.  Assume  that  the  weights  are  each  .5.  The  correlation 
between  the  instruments  is  .60.  Ignoring  lognormality  for  now,  the  op- 
tion  on  the  basket  can  be  priced  as  a  vanilla  with  the  volatility  equal  to:

Should  the  correlation  go  to  .5,  the  volatility  of  the  basket  would  de- 
crease  to 9.96%.  Should  correlation  go to  —1,  the  effect  would  be to com- 
press  the  option  price.

Risk  Management  Rule:  The  Correlation  Trap.  A  basket  option  — 
needs  to  trade  below  the  level  imparted  by a  correlation  of  T an 
above  the  level  imparted  by a  correlation  of  —1  where  either  of the 
volatilities  is  independently  (or  partially  independently)  variable. 
This  is a  simple  extension  of the  contamination  principle.  It results 
because@  correlation  becomes  convex  for  the_seller  when  it neigh- 
bors  1 and  for  the  buyer  when  it neighbors  —1. 

———

. 

Another  related  option  is  a quanto  option.  This  is an  option  where  the 
residual  from  the  trade  (i.e.,  the  P/L)  depends  on  a  foreign  rate  that  may 
be correlated  with  it.  This  represents  a  weak  correlation  effect  to  take  into 
account. 

COMPOSITE  UNDERLYING  SECURITIES 

UC A  composite underlying  security is a  security  whose  payoff  is linked  to 
a  formula  related  to  the  price  of two  or  more  securities.  Typically,  oper- 
ators  bundle  in  such  categories  options  on  assets  that  are  combined  in 
such  a  way  as  to  prevent  uncorrelated  delta  neutrality. 

Being  tailor-made,  these  securities  have  no  stable  specifications.  These  se- 
curities  can  be  ratios  or  weighted  combinations  (linear  or  nonlinear).  Linear 
combinations  have  been  addressed.  The  following  case  study  examines  an 
indexed  note  (a combination  involving  a  quotient). 

Defining  the  categories  is a  generally  difficult  task  so  each  one  of them 
must  be  tailor-priced,  generally  through  numerical  techniques.  Complica- 
tions  can  arise  when  a  sum  is involved:  A ratio  of two  log-normal  returns  is 
lognormal,  but  not  the  sum,  which  brings  the  operator  back  to  the  basket 
problem. 

Often  correlations  are  involved  in  such  instruments.  Operators  need  to 
exercise  great  care,  however,  in  finding  the  partial  derivatives  (partial  delta, 
partial  gamma,  etc.),  as  the  correlation  measures  will  show  serious  instability. 
Without  probing  into  the  firms’  motivations  when  they  issue  such  in- 
struments,  this  author  would  warn  potential  customers  not  to  look  at  path- 
dependent  payoffs  without  a  correcting  lens  as  the  final  term  sheets  can 
be  seriously  misleading  when  conditional  on  some  path,  as  seen  with  the 
French-Franc  case  study. 

QUANTITATIVE  CASE  STuDy:  INDEXED  NOTES 

This  case  study  affords  the  reader  a  study  of a  composite  underlying  secu- 
rity that  can  only be  decomposed  using a correlation  analysis. 

396 

§=Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

Mathematical  Note: 
This  indexed  note,  in  addition,  illustrates  a 
classical  problem  of  instruments  that  are  presented  in  incomplete 
markets  and  that  need  to  be  priced  on a statistical  (expected  expi- 
ration  value),  non-arbitrage  basis. 

In  consequence,  instantaneous  volatility  and  correlation  can  no 
longer  be  used,  but  rather  term  (expiration)  volatility  and  correla- 
tions.  We  also  recommends  the  use  of  trader’s  sense  in  describing 
the  discrete  possible  states  as  opposed  to  continuous-time  finance. 

Background 

A friend  of the  author  was  told  by some  indexed  notes  salesperson  that  the 
following  note  “embedded  a  currency  option”  making  it more  valuable  in 
the  eyes  of  his  firm.  The  friend,  seasoned  enough  to  discount  salespeo- 
ple’s  opinions,  especially  on  such  matters  as  option  valuation  asked  the 
author  to  tie  the  note  with  the  topics  covered  in  the  book.  This  examina- 
tion  will  be  limited  to  an  intuitive  approach;  the  attempt  at  pricing  the 
note  aims  only  at  the  general  qualitative  sensitivity  rather  than  at  estab- 
lishing  the  elusive  fair  value. 

Terms  of  the  Note 

Mexico  issued  on  December  5, 1995,  a USD-denominated  note  paying  the  fol- 
lowing  (using  the  notation  of the  term  sheet): 

Face  Value  (in USD)  x  Max  (CETES  option  or  LIBOR  option)  on  No- 
vember  27,  1996. 

°  With  LIBOR  option  =  FV  x  (1  + USD  LIBOR  X  Actual  days/360) 

known  on  the  issue  date  with  certainty. 

e  LIBOR  =  12  month  USD  LIBOR  rate  2 days before  the  issue.  Assume 

that  the  LIBOR  option  will  be fixed  at  1.056. 

CETES  option  =  FV MXN,  MXN,/USD, 

°  MXN,  =  MXN-USD  (i.e.,  number  of  pesos  per  1 U.S.  dollar)  2 days 

prior  to  the  issuance  of the  note.  Assume  it to be fixed  at  7.7. 

°  MXN,  =  1 +  Max  (CETES  rate  on  expiration  minus  2 days  (annual- 
ized  actual/360)  —  .06,  0).  The  CETES  rate  is  the  Mexican  govern- 
ment  note.  The  analysis  ignores  that  the  CETES  rate  will  be 

Multiasset  Options 

397 

compounded  from  the  issue  date,  which  causes  some  differences,  up 
to  30 basis  points. 

e  USD,  =  Peso  rate  MXN-USD  on  expiration  minus  2 days. 

The  term  sheet  explains  that  the  government  of  the  United  States  of 
Mexico  would  be glad to  accommodate  the  holder  in local  currency  should  it 
run  out  of dollars.  This  can  be interpreted  as  meaning  that  the  owner  is not 
exempt  from  the  well-known  default,  or  convertibility  risk:  Governments 
have  gotten  into  the bad  habit  of making  the  transfer  of money  illegal  when- 
ever  they face  a  shortage  of foreign  reserves.  The  note  may  thus  end  up  pay- 
ing back  in nonconvertible  pesos  forcing  the  holder  to brush  up  his  Spanish 
and  elect  some  peaceful  existence  near  a  Mexican  golf course. 

Where  Is  the  Underlying? 

Using  revised  terminology,  the  note’s  value  (in dollars)  will  be: 

exp  (—rt)  Max  (7.7  (1 +  c,)  X  1/MXN-USD,  1.056)  —  {Default  risk} 

or  roughly, 

exp  (—rt)  Max  (7.7  (1 +  c,) X  1/MXN-USD  —  1.056,  0) +  1 —  {Default  risk} 

since  the  1 +  LIBOR  at  inception  will  be  equal  to  the  financing  rate  exp  (7); 
r  is  the  continuously  compounded  rate  used  in  these  formulas;  c  is  the 
CETES  rate.  Therefore  it could  be: 

1 +  Call  on  U witha 

strike  price  of 0 —  {Default  risk}. 

With 

U=77  0 +6)  aly MXN-USD,  —.1.056 

Barring  the  default  risk,  this  note  seems  to  be  a  simple  call  on  an  underlying 
security  that  we  first  need  to  define.  The  security  is principally  composed  of 
the  product  of the  CETES  and  the  currency  (in American  terms)  or  the  divi- 
sion  of  the  CETES  and  the  currency  (in  peso  terms).  Is  this  product  a  cur- 
rency?  Not  very  likely,  unless  one  of  the  terms  (the  CETES  rate)  remains 
frozen.  Also  the  note  would  be  a  call  on  the  CETES  rate  if the  currency  re- 
mained  frozen.  Somehow,  the  cases  where  one  would  move  and  the  other  re- 
main  frozen  are  limited  to  spreadsheet  exercises.  Assume  that  both  CETES 
and  the  currency  move  in opposite  directions  when  expressed  in dollar  terms 
(the  rates  go up when  the  peso  weakens)  and  in  the  same  direction  when  the 

398 

Trading  and  Hedging  Exotic  Options 

operator  looks  at  the  currency  in peso  terms  (the  rates  go up  when  the  dollar 
rallies  against  the  peso).  So  the  underlying  for  the  currency  option  will  be 
conditionally  linked  to  the  currency  or  the  CETES. 

The  potential  buyer  could  therefore  start  correcting  the  salesperson.  He 
should  have  said,  “This  note  has  an  embedded  option  on  an  instrument  that 
I cannot  quite  define  but  that  is related  somewhat  to  a  currency.” 

Should  such  a  product  exist  in  the  market,  it  would  be  easy  for  the 
holder  of the  note  to  go delta-neutral  against  it, and  apply  all  the  great  rules 
of dynamic  hedging.  But  the  salesperson  no  doubt  would  show  no  intention 
to  make  such  a  market.  It is therefore  necessary  to  study  the  structure  as  a 
multiasset  by design,  as  defined  in  Chapter  1.  This  is  similar  to  a  currency 
option  on  a bizarre  pair that  the  owner  needs  to hedge  by triangular  decom- 
position  only,  therefore  having  to  look  at  such  matters  as  correlation. 

As  to  the  default  risk,  it could  be best  priced  by considering  it an  Amer- 
ican  binary  option  on  a  percentage  of the  face  value,  itself  correlated  to  the 
currency  rate. 

Triangular  Decomposition 

Omit  the  1 from  the  formula  for  a  while.  Look  at  the  payoff  at  expiration 
(Figure  22.8). 

e 

The  figure  shows  that  most  of  the  payoff  of  the  note  corresponds  to 
areas  Northeast,  which  corresponds  to  a  higher  CETES  and  a  stronger  Mex- 
ican  peso,  something  not  very  likely  to  occur  in real  life.  It is unnecessary  to 
price  it to  see  that  such  an  area  is  not  very  likely:  Operators  generally  ex- 
pect  high-yielding  currencies  to  raise  their  rate  when  they  weaken  and 

Payoff

Multiasset  Options 

399 

lower  it during  the  (rare)  times  of strength.  The  embedded  currency  option 
only comes  into  play in such  areas. 

Furthermore  the  expected  return  from  the  Mexican  peso  is  far  to  the 
right of the  inception  rate,  because  the Mexican  forward  trades  at a discount 
(the  dollar  at a  premium). 

Assuming  l-year  forward  rates  =  CETES  (a  simplification  as  the 
yield  curve  is being  eliminated  for  pedagogical  reasons) 

Mu = interest  rate  differential.  Assume  it  to  be  .225%  (the  differ- 
ence  between  the  United  States  and  Mexican  rate  to  use  only  the  in- 
formation  available  on  the  sheet). 

Forward  Mexico  =  Spot  exp  ( —Mu  f) the  equivalent  of 9.64  peso  to 
the  dollar.  Additional  pricing  information  will  be  relegated  to  the 
technical  note. 

e  The  first  conclusion  is  that,  as  the  salesperson  initially  said,  such 
note  has  some  form  of  “optionality”  in  it  (in  the  absence  of  default 
risk)  because  it pays  nothing  in  most  parts  of the  map  and  could  pay 
something  somewhere.  By the  rule  of stochastic  dominance  it needs 
to be  worth  some  premium. 

e  The  next  step  is to  evaluate  the  optionality  by computing  the  proba- 
bility  of ending  up  on  each  spot  on  the  map.  Intuitively,  the  operator 
has  already  established  that  the  raised  areas  are  quite  unlikely. 

Next,  it  is  necessary  to  estimate  the  probability  environment  at  some 
high  correlation  between  the  two  elements  MXN-USD  and  CETES.  Figure 
22.9  shows  the  probability  of being  on  every  spot  of Figure  22.8  assuming  a 
75%  correlation: 

¢  A  warning. 

One  needs  to  be  careful  about  correlation.  This  map  is 
an  expiration  map  and  requires  the  use  of  longer  term  correlation. 
Using  daily  correlations  will  include  some  noise  that  will  be  of 
small  significance  with  such  an  abnormal  market  as  Mexico.  An- 
other  way  to  look  at it using  the  variance  ratio  method  of analysis  is 
that  there  may  be  a  bias  linked  to  the  frequency  of  sampling: 
Shorter  sampling  periods  would  show a lower  correlation  measure. 
Finally,  up-correlation  is usually  different  from  down-correlation,  a 
point  discussed  in Chapter  15. 

e  Another  warning.  When  deriving  fair  value  for  such  a  security, 
one  needs  to  be  careful  about  the  horizon.  Assuming  that  the  oper- 
ator  is  with  either  a  mean-reverting  process  or  any  process  with 
some  heteroskedasticity,  one  needs  to  be  warned  against  the  risks

of assuming  that  V At,  the  square  root  of time  notion  works  (i.e.,  the 
variance  is linearly  proportional  to  the  time  horizon).  Therefore  one 
cannot  use  the  notion  of daily  measured  volatility  to  price  the  final 
payoff.  See  the  discussion  in Chapter  6. 

The  reader  can  mentally  combine  the  two  maps  to  examine  the  condi- 
tional  nature  of the  payoff.  We  do  not  need  additional  mathematics  to  see 
that  the  area  Northeast  of the  mountain  will  show  increased  country  de- 
fault  risk,  a  risk  that  is not  rewarded  for,  as  if it would  force  the  owner  of 
the  note  to  retire  in Mexico.  There  is indeed  a  tautological  relationship  be- 
tween  higher  interest  rates  in  a  country,  weaker  currency,  and  increased 
default  risk. 

An  examination  of the  sensitivities  shows: 

¢  The  note  statically  gains  in value  if either  the  CETES  or  the  currency 
gain  in  volatility.  This  can  be  visible  on  the  map:  the  mountain  in 
Figure  22.10  would  become  thicker  and  cover  more  payoff  areas. 

¢  The  note  statically  gains  in  value  if the  correlation  weakens  between 
the  two.  It would  also  make  the  area  of  the  mountain  less  diagonal 
(see  ricure  2.1): 

If Mexico  was  defined  as  a  biased  asset,  as  in  Chapter  15,  the  operator 
would  have  expectations  of  a  behavior  that  is  conditional  on  market 
regimes:  Mexico  would  have  a  higher  volatility  in  some  panic  conditions 
that  are  linked  to  the  position  of the  currency  on  some  spots  over  the  map. 
The  definition  of biased  asset  also  stated  that  the  down-correlation  is higher 
than  the  up-correlation,  a  result  of  a  negative-Poisson  that  affects  both  the 
rates  and  the  currency  pair.”  If the  two  are  governed  by a diffusion  plus  a 
negative  jump  that  affects  both  of  them,  it becomes  conceivable  that  the

tives  bears  no  true  benefit.  This  analysis  therefore  will  skip  the  sensitivity

The  operator  needs  to  study  the  process  for  MXN-USD  not  USD-MXN 

as  the  numeraire  is (so far)  in USD.  He  has  the  expected  rate  period  t

So  the  expectations  for  USD-MXN  are  9.645,  while  those  of the  MXN-USD 
are  at  35%  volatility  in  the  currency,  at  10.90.  This  is another  illustration  of

Minor  Exotics:  Lookback  and 
Asian  Options 

A veteran  trader-intellectual 
friend  of the author,  waxing  philosophical  after a few 
sips  of a remarkable  Bordeaux,  pointed  at  the  bottle  and  uttered:  “A  trader  with  a 
good  mind,  like  good  wine,  improves  with  age.  A  bad  trader  rapidly  turns  into 
vinegar.” 

This  chapter  presents  some  options  that,  despite  the  plethora  of  research 
publications  on  their  subject,  do  not  represent  any  meaningful  trading  nov- 
elty on  their  own.  They  are  called  minor  exotics  as  most  of the  information 
has  been  included  in  the  previous  chapters  on  exotics.

LOOKBACK  AND  LADDER  OPTIONS 

Lookback  options  are  options  that  allow  the  owner  to  sell  the  high  or 
buy the  low  over a set  period. 

As  such,  they 
are  called  “floating  strike,”  Chere are  other  varieties  of look- 
back  options,  such  as  the  fixed strike  where the  owner  of the  structure  owns 
an  at-the-money  option  that  will  be  exercised  at  the  maximum  over  the  pe- 
riod)Such  varieties  will  not  be  examined  here. 

The  major  problem  with  lookback  options  is that  they  do  not  customar- 
ily trade,  owing  to  their  high price.  They  are  indeed  very  costly:  as  a  rule  of 
thumb,  approximately  twice  the  premium  of a  conventional  option.

Example: 
The  structure  presented  in Figure  23.1  allowed  the  owner  to 
sell  the  high  over  the  period.  The  high  turned  out  to  be  116.92.  The 
owner  became  the  happy  owner  of a  put struck  at  116.92. 

There  are  many  ways  to  view  lookback  options  for  risk  management. 
Exotic  option  traders  grounded  in  barrier  options  usually  have  no  real  dif- 
ficulty  understanding  the  skew  exposures  stemming  from  the  product.

The  principal  risk  is the  gamma.  It becomes  easy  to  see  that  the  option 
has'a  gamma  that  is  “one-sided,”  as  it  requires  action  on  one  side  of  the 
market  and  not  the  other.  A lookback  option  that  has  reached  a  maximum, 
say  117  (as in Figure  23.1),  and  dropped  below  such  maximum,  would  not 
really  present  any  major  gamma  for  the  seller  unless  the  market  reaches  a 
new  high.  This  is called  a  one-sided  gamma  exposure.  Such a situation  is 
reminiscent  of barrier  options  where  the  gamma  changes  in style beyond  a 
barrier. 

The  Rollover  Option 

Lookback  options  can  be  viewed  for  risk  management  from  two  angles:  the 
roll-over  replication  on  one  hand  and  the  limit  decomposition  on  the  other. 
The  original  pricing  by Goldman,  Sosin,  and  Gatto!  was  inspired  by the  fol- 
lowing  replicating  strategy. 

Assume  that  the  dealer  sells  a  lookback  call  to  the  customer;  that  is, the 
right to buy the  low  over  the  next  year.  The  dealer  would  initially  buy a one- 
year  at-the-money  call.  Should  the  market  rally  immediately,  the  trader 
would  be relieved  as  the  risk  would  no  longer  require  dynamic  hedging.  The 
markets,  however,  have  a  bad  tendency  of  swinging a little.  To  guarantee 
owning  a  call  struck  at  the  low,  the  dealer  would  have  to  roll  his  option  po- 
sition  into  a  lower  strike  call  every  time  the  market  dropped.  Such a roll  in- 
cludes  a  cash  expenditure.  The  additional  cost  could  be  easily  calculated 
with  the  aid  of a  stochastic  integral.  The  lookback  option  would  then  be  the 
sum  of the  two  components: 

1.  The  original  option. 

2.  The  costs  of the  call  spread  “roll-down.” 

Minor  Exotics:  Lookback  and  Asian  Options 

405 

The  stochastic  integration  (in present  value)  of the  cost  function  corre- 
sponds  to  the  markup  over  an  at-the-money  option.  Such  an  option  is 
known  as  a  “strike  bonus.” 

Using  this  framework  to  analyze  lookbacks  can  provide  the  operator 
with  the  intuition  of the  real  problem  with  their  trading:  the  skew  A look- 
back  call  will  be  more  valuable  with  a  downside  skew  (when  lower  strikes 
are  more  expensive)  because  its  maximum  gamma  will  always  be  posi- 
tioned  at  the  lowest  price  the  market  reached  over  the  lifetime  of the  option. 
would  be less  valuable 
Likewise,  a  lookback  put in such  a  skew  environment 
because  its  gamma  would  be  located  at  upper  levels.|The  reader  should 
know  by now  that  in  down-skewed  markets  the  upside  is  not  where  the 
gamma  should  be  located. 

Risk  Management  Rule: 
exposure  that  is not  possible  to  hedge  with  vanilla  options. 

The  lookback  option  has  a  third  moment 

The  reason  for  the  rule  is  that  the  gamma  of the  lookback  would  always

match the gamma  risk  would rapidly  move away  from  the 

be  maximum  at  the  recorded  extreme  during  its  lifetime(A 
“that  would initially 
money  in a  continuous  sell-off  while  the  lookback  would  retain  its  gamma. 

One  consolation,  however,  is  that  the  lookback  gamma  remains  one- 
sided.  The  operator  would  not  be whipped  both  ways.  Figure  23.2  shows  the 
exact  issue:  The  gamma  of  the  option  follows  a  bell-shaped  curve  around 
the  strike  while  that  of the  lookback  looks  like  a  cliff  with  a  flat  top. 

Before  looking  at the  second  method  of pricing  the  lookback  for hedging 
purposes,  the  reader  should  examine  some  form  of  combination  involving 
them. 

CF ladder  options  are  lookback  options  giving  the  owner  the  right  to  sell 
the  high  or  buy  the  low  at  some  set  discrete  increments.  They  are  also 
called  discrete  lookbacks.

The  same  lookback  as  before  allows  the  owner  to  sell  the 
Example: 
high but  in $5 increments.  It can  sell  105,  110,  115,  120,  and  so  forth.  The 
high  was  116.90  but  the  owner  of  the  structure  was  able  to  sell  at  115, 
which  is not  disastrous. 

Figure  23.3  shows  that  the  ladder  resembles  a  lookback  that  is “rounded” 
in  price.  They  will  come  cheaper  because  their  payoff  is  capped  at  that  of 
he  lookback.  In  the  previous  example,  the  ladder  paid  off  $1.90  less  than  the 
lookback. 

Mathematicians  know  that  applied  problems  can  be  approached  from 
several  different  disciplines  to  yield  identical  results:  The  same  applies  to 
option  valuation.  The  ladder  option  can  be  viewed  as  a  lookback  when  the 
strike  bonus  part  is  only  calculated  off  a  set  price  increment.  It can  also  be 
seen  a  strip  of knock-in  options. 

Assume  that  the  option  gives  the  right  to  sell  the  asset  at  the  best  high 
rounded  to  the  lowest  5 points,  say  100,  105,  110,  115,  and  so  on  for  the  next 
year.  Also  assume  an  asset  price  of 100.  Such  option  can  be decomposed  into 
the  following,  using  the  notation  KI(strike,  trigger):

and  so  forth  until  the  difference  between  the  KI(S,S)  and  the  KI(S,S  +  5) 
vanishes  to  a  small  number. 

Now  the  skew:  The  reader  can  calculate  the  skew  for  knock-in  options 
using  the  method  in  Chapter  19,  thus  building  a  more  accurate  model  for 
both  ladders  and  the  general  lookback. 

The  lookback  option  can  be  viewed  as  a  limiting  case  of such  decompo- 
sition  as  the  difference  between  strikes  becomes  very  narrow.  The  general 
formula  is: 

Laddermax  =  limit  e0  Sum(KIP(S,,S,)  —  KIP(S,,S,  +  €)) 
from  i =  1 to  infinity,  with  e  as  increment. 

The  ladder  minimum  is  the  same  mirror  constructed  with  knock-in 
calls.  Skew-minded  traders  will  not  fail  to  improve  on  the  formula  by using 
a  volatility  function,  that  is  related  to  the  strike  price  of  the  barrier.  Typi- 
cally,  this  will  raise  the  price  of the  lookback  considerably. 

igure  23.4  shows  how  the  price  of a  strip  of  knock-in  options  will  con- 
rge  away  from  that  of a  lookback  as  the  trader  increases  the  size  of the  dif- 
ference  between  the  legs of the  knock-in.  The  graph  depicts  an  at-the-money, 
one-year  option  with  no  drift  and  10%  volatility.  At  the  extreme  left,  is  the 
price  of a  lookback,  close  to  twice  the  price  of a  vanilla.  At  the  extreme  right 
is the  value  of a  vanilla. 

addition  to  the  skew,  the  product  shows  the  “driftwood”  effect  as 
4ders  tend  to  call  it, which  is  the  same  chronic  problem 
as that incurred 
with  barrier  options.  This  is the  concentration  of strikes  right below  the  re- 
cent  lows  and  above  the  recent  highs.  It results  in  considerable  bad  gamma, 
which  is the  gamma  the  operator  will  start  incurring  as  the  cost  of covering 
it turns  onerous. 

Finally,  it is worthy  mentioning  another  application  of the  omnipresent 
Arcsine  law  of  the  random  walk  that  was  used  for  the  distribution  of  the 
profits  or  loss  of an  individual  trader  in Chapter  3 (see  Figure  23.5).  The  dis- 
tribution  of the  extrema  of any  Brownian  motion  will  be  such  that  it will  be 
maximal  very  early  on  or  very  late  in  the  game.

saris in  the  middle  of the  period  makes  the  concept  easier  to  grasp. 
Assume  that  the  option  has  six  months  to  expiration  and  that  the  market 
just  made  new  lows.  The  probability  of the  new  low  of being  the  low  of the 
next  six  months  is very  weak  as  the  market  has  a high probability  of moving 
down  further.  It is as  if the  trader  were  standing  with  an  entirely  new  look- 
back  option  in  front  of him. 

Look  at  the  beginning  of the  period:  The  possibility  of the  market  hav- 
ing reached  one  of its  extremes  is very  high  as  any  trend  will  build  up  on 
the  other  side.  If one  throws  dice  and  make  three  winnings,  the  cumulative 
P/Lis  three.  The  trend  is such  that  the  probability  of the  lows  (here  0) being 
close  to  the  origin  is highest. 

A FOOTNOTE  ON  BASKET  OPpTIONs:  ASIAN  OPTIONS 

Asian  options  are  commonly  entrusted  to junior  traders  owing  to  the  regu- 
larity  of their  risks  and  the  ease  of their  management. 

“ Asian options  refer  to  options  on  averages.*  Their  payoff  depends  on  a 

weighted  combination  of events  through  a  certain  period. 

aoe options  include  the  average  floating  strike  where,  as  with  the  lookback,

strike,  an  option  that  has  a  known  strike  and  that  settles  at  the  weighted  av-

As  with  the  exercise  of  Chapter  22,  the  following  will  help  the  reader 

understand  some  of their  pricing  difficulty. 

Assume  an  average  of four  days.  One  would  have  the  following  process: 

Geometric 
average 

=  (Sq 5, exp(—%2  1/365  0?  +  01/365)  z,) Sr exp(=  22/00)  O-

=  S, exp(  —'2  6/365  6? +  0\(1/365)(3  z, +  22, +  z,))" 

The  process  takes  an  exponential  shape  and  can  easily  yield  some 

closed  form  results  using  simple  Black-Scholes-Merton. 

The  arithmetic  average,  however,  will  be  more  illuminating.  Look  at  the 

process  for  the  same  four  days: 

average 

Arithmetic  a(S  hk  S .exp(—/2  1/365:0°  +  o\(1/365)z,)

+  S, exp(—'2  3/365  o? +  0\(1/365)(z,  +  z, +  z,))) 

exactly  as  if the  user  were  looking  at  a  linear  combination  of options  on  in- 
dependent  assets  of the  same  volatility  (it is  known  that  ye  ee  ae akeaim 
dependent).  There  is  little  lognormality  to  it  as  the  process  cannot  be 
summarized  in  the  form  S, =  S, exp(something).  In  other  words,  one  cannot 
obtain  dS/S  a  normally  distributed  variable.

This  complication  has  caused  some  ink  to  flow.  As  a  trader,  the  author 
was  rapidly  put  to  sleep  by Asians.  As  an  amateur  probabilist,  he  discov- 
ered  the  process  to  be  quizzical.° 

The  remaining  of the  chapter  will  focus  on  the  few  points  that  matter 
for  hedging.  The  pricing  methods  currently  in  place  attempt  to  fudge  the 
process  of the  average  2w.S, by finding  some  form  that  can  track  the  bias  be- 
tween  the  lognormal  distribution  and  that  of the  averages. 

The  reader  will  be  happy  to  learn  that  such  bias  is the  skew.  Most  fudg- 
ing methods  attempt  to  replicate  the  distribution  by detecting  its  moments 
and  coming  up  with  a  lognormal  distribution  function  that  satisfies  such 
moments.  Still  most  traders  are  satisfied  and  resort  to  the  more  entertain- 
ing Monte  Carlo  engines  as  will  be  seen. 

By comparing  the  distribution  of the  average  to  that  of the  underlying 
itself,  it is possible  to  see  that  the  ratio  of the  second  moments  of the  distri- 
butions  is  close  to  1/V3.  So  the  instantaneous  local  variance  can  be  miti- 
gated  with  a  ratio  hedge  of equal  amounts: 

¢  The  trader  buys  an  Asian  option  and  sells  a  corresponding  vanilla  in 
proper  gamma  neutral  ratios  of approximately  1.73  to  1.  Figure  23.6 
compares  each  position  independently. 

. 

e  Figure  23.7  shows  the  spread  between  them,  as  expected,  short  the 

skew. 

i 

A  helpful  way  to  understand  the  effect  is  through  the  notion  of com- 
pounding.  A  sum  of exponentials  does  not  compound  in  the  same  way  as 
an  exponential  of  a sum.  A sum  of exponentials,  say  exp(n)  +  exp(m),  that 
are  equal  to  another  exp(a  +  b)  will  not  track  the  growth  when  they 
are  all  multiplied  by  2.  The  result  is  exp(2n)  +  exp(2m)  compared  to

exp(2(a  +  b)).  The  reader  can  try  it as  an  exercise  to  see  one  of the  convex 
qualities  of the  exponential. 

When  pricing  an  Asian  option,  the  reader  is  recommended  to  use  for- 
ward  volatility  and  interest  rates  (i.e.,  the  entire  curve)  as  every  bucket  mat- 
ters.  It is also  recommended  to  use  a  Monte  Carlo  whenever  volatility  rises 
above  30%.  In most  other  cases,  a  pricing  model  based  on  the  usual  approx- 
imations  would  do.  More  precision  in  the  approximation  is minuscule  com- 
‘pared  with  the  precision  lost  in  the  use  of the  homoskedastic  model. 

A  few  final  points: 

¢  Bucketing.  Asian  options  require  a  schedule  of  bucket  vegas  and  a 
distribution  of  forwards.  Strangely,  the  middle  point  for  forward 
hedges  resembles  visually  that  of the  stopping  time. 

e  A  Catch.  An  arithmetic  average  is not  invertible,  by Jensen’s  inequal- 
ity. An  average  on  USD-DEM  is not  equal  to  1/average  on  DEM-USD.

Brownian  Motion  on  a 
Spreadsheet,  a Tutorial  | ~ 

This  module  provides  an  introduction  to  the  random  walk. 

vv 

WA random  walk  for  security  prices  means  that  a  share  of  the  price 
changes  of the  security  over  a  given  period  of time  is random.\The  share 
of the  price  change  that  is not  expected  to  be  random  is called  the  drift. 

& 

Financial  instruments,  for  reasons  of efficiency,  are  assumed  to  follow  a 

random  process  that  we  will  let  the  reader  create  on  a  spreadsheet. 

wiggneten  motion  =  Random  walk  +  Drift 

These  exercises  will  focus  on  the  random  component.  The  drift  will  be 

covered  in Module  B. 

THE  CLASSICAL  ONE-ASSET  RANDOM  WALK 

Think  of  a  drunk  man  on  Madison  Avenue.  Dead  drunk,  he  will  have 
no  memory  as  to  where  he  was  last.  He  can  only  move  forward  and  will 
keep  moving  at  the  same  pace.  Each  one  of his  steps  will  be  exactly  one  for- 
ward  + left  or  one  forward  +  right,  as  shown  in  Figure  A.1. 

After  10 steps,  the  following  combinations  are  possible:  10 forward  +  10 
left  on  one  extreme  and  10 forward  +  10 right on  the  other  extreme,  with  all 
the  combinations  in between.

(Securities  markets  are  assumed  to follow  a  similar  walk,  with  one  hitch: 
The  size  of  the  steps  increases  in  function  of  the  asset’s  price)Creating  a 
random  walk  on  an  Excel™  spreadsheet  will  provide® a  good  illustration  of 
the  concept:'

Number  of random  numbers  =  248 

Distribution  =  Normal 

Mean  =  0 

Standard  deviation  =  1 

Output  range  =  B4 

=>  OK 

Excel  will  generate  248  random  numbers.  The  average  will  be  close  to  0. 
These  numbers  are  then  called  normally  distributed  with  a  mean  of 0 and  a 
standard  deviation  of 1. 

i 

Put  the  number  100  in  cell  A3.  This  will  be  the  initial  asset  price.  Next, 
put  the  volatility  of  the  asset  (say  .157)  in  cell  A2. This  means  that  the  an- 
nual  standard  deviation is  V248 = 15.7%  (a daily equivalent  of 1%  ona  248- 
day year).  In  cell  A4,  put the  following  formula: 

ASX  EXP(=.5-$A92"  2 *  (1/248)  +  SA$2  X  (11/15.  7) X  B4) 

and  copy  it down  to  A251.  This  would  be  the  path  of daily  returns:

Equating  the  cells  to  the  preceding  formula  is accomplished  as  follows:

oe  we 

b=  1/248 

Vit =  SORT  (1/248)  since  every  line  is one  day, so  Vt =  SORT  CH/15.7) 

W, is the  random  number  with  mean 0 and  average  positive  1 and  negative  —1. 

Next  select  (A3:A251)  and  graph  it.  Figure  A.2  will  result. 

Repeating  the  random  number  generation  to  get a  fresh  series  of “white 

noise”  numbers  causes  new  paths  to  form  on  the  screen. 
Increasing  the  volatility  magnifies  the  movement.

SOME  QUESTIONS 

Question  1 
(a  question  that  is  invariably  asked):  How  does  one  go 
from  the  drunk  man  with  equal  size  steps  to  the  unequal  steps  W,? (W, 
can  be  any  number  between  minus  infinity  and  infinity,  and  take  on  a 
wide  array  of values  like  .56,  1.03.) 

The  answer  lies  at the  core  of probability  laws  and  involves  breaking 
up  time  in infinitely  small  fractions  of ‘40 of  a second  where  such  move- 
ment  takes  place  in digital  form  +1  and  —1. 

The  sum  of  the  moves  after  1 second  (composed  of  10  moves)  will 
average  0 but  will  be  spread  between  —10  and  +10.  Assuming  the  +1 
and  —1  came  from a “fair”  random  number  generator,  the  resulting  his- 
togram  of the  1-second  moves  will  present  a  clearly  defined  bell  shape. 
The  reader  can  try  that  in  a  spreadsheet  by creating  a  tree,  with  up- 
branch  +1  and  down-branch  —1.  There  will  be  1024  combinations 
called  sample  paths  leading  to  11  possible  outcomes.  After  10  steps,  the 
outcome  can  only be  an  even  number  of steps.  The  final  proportions  are 
shown  in Table  A.1  and  plotted  in Figure  A.3. 

This  represents  a  heuristic  derivation  of  the  central  limit  theorem 
(in its  simplest  form:  DeMoire-Laplace).  The  sum  of a  +1,  —1  series  of 
random  steps  approaches  the  bell-shaped  distribution  shown  in  Figure 
A.3  when  one  increases  the  number  of observations.  An  apparent  con- 
straint  is that  the  steps  need  to  be  the  same  size  at  all  times.  The  law  is 
simpler  to  understand  in that  context,  except  that  it is perhaps  the  most 
misinterpreted  law  in  the  history  of mathematics. 

Question  2  Why  is the  standard  deviation  the  square  root  of time? 

In the  preceding  scenario,  it was  assumed  that  every  step  for  the  +1, 
—1  distribution  is  a  unit  of  time.  The  standard  deviation  is  the  square

and  since  all  the  W?  =  1, and  t, the  time  equals  n,  0  =  Vt 

Therefore  the  standard  deviation  of the  binary  +1,  —1  is equal  to  the 
square  root  of  the  number  of  steps.  It  is  apparent  that  the  standard 
deviation  in  this  exercise  would  equal  to  V10  =  3.16.  Roughly  two- 
thirds  of the  paths  lie between  +3.16  and  —3.16.

Option  Wizard:  The  Diffusion 

. 

The  random  walk  on a spreadsheet  illustrates  a  diffusion  process. 

The  principal  property  of  a  diffusion  is that,  no  matter  how  small  time  is 
sliced,  the  function  remains  jagged.  It will  always  look  geometrically  like  the 
following  sample  path: 

The  same  sample  path  with  more  frequent  observations  would  look  like 

this: 

Slicing  time  in  even  smaller  increments  would  not  make  the  picture  any 
“rounder”  in  any  of  its  segments.  Although  it  is continuous,  it  is  nowhere  dif- 
ferentiable  and  does  not  become  so  any  time.  A  fashionable  term  to  describe 
such  jaggedness  is  the  “fractal”  structure(Students  taking  college  calculus 
learn,  through  _Taylor  methods,  that  any  function  in  a  very  narrow  segment 
could  be  expanded  into  a  polynomial  involving  its  derivatives. 

~  Fx  +  Oe  (Xe  (eA 

xe  oer  Ne  ee  XC  a) 

They  also  learn  that,  for  a  function  S of time  t, when  the  partitions  become 
very  small,  (AS)?  +  0 when  t  >  0.  One  of the  fundamental  rules  of stochastic 
calculus  is that  no  matter 
how small  time  is  sliced,  AS?  does  not  vanish  owing 
to  the  random  element  in  it.  As  a matter 

of fact AS? >  o?  At. 

For  an  option  trader,  such  intuition  is  important: 

If there  is  a  possible 
smoothness  on  the  curve  of  the  underlying,  then  the  manufacturing  costs  of 
the  option  through  gamma  rebalancing  would  be  lowered  provided  the  opera- 
tor  picked  a  frequency  of hedges  that  matched  such  increment.  Black-Scholes- 
Merton  does  not  allow  for  such:  Even  if the  trader  rebalanced  every  billionth  of 
the  second,  the  cost  of the  option  would  not  go  down.

A Two-AsseET  RANDOM  WALK:  AN  INTRODUCTION 
TO  THE  EFFECTS  OF  CORRELATION 

As  the  single-asset  random  walk  has  been  used  in  connection  with  the 
drunk  man,  think  of a  drunk  bird  in  space.  Its  location  at  any  time  will  be 
determined  by the  elevation  and  position  on  the  map  (north-south  and  east- 
west).  So  the  location  of the  bird  requires  three  pieces  of information.  It is 
therefore  considered  in three  dimensions. 

The  two-asset  random  walk  can  easily  be  simulated  on  the  computer, 
and  it does  not  require  very  complex  matrix  algebra.  The  hitch  is that  three 
parameters  must  be estimated:  volatility  of asset  A, volatility  of asset  B, cor- 
relation  between  the  assets. 

Note.  The  reader  can  ignore  matrix  algebra  for  now  and  take  the  results 

for  granted. 

As  in  the  example  before,  the  reader  can  simulate  the  same  Brownian 

motion. 

The  example  can  be  done  on  a  similar  spreadsheet  as  before  but  with 

cells  defined  as  names  for  ease  of computation. 

There  are  two  assets  A and  B: 

. 

Go  to  Excel™ 

Open  a  new  spreadsheet 
Tools  —  Data  analysis  +  Random  number  generation 
Number  of variables  =  2 

Number  of random  numbers  =  252 

Distribution  =  Normal 

Mean  =  0 

Standard  deviation  =  1 

Output  range  =  B4 

—  OK 

As  in the  previous  example,  there  are  two  series  of independent  random 
numbers.  The  first  asset  A will  be  independent.  The  second  will  need  to be 
bridged  to  the  first  by the  corresponding  correlation: 

Cell  Al:Type  Voll 
Cell  B1  type  1  >  Insert  ~ Name  >  Define.  Name  Voll 
Cell  A2:  Type Vol2 
Cell  B2  type  1  >  Insert  +  Name  >  Define.  Name  Vol2 
Cell  A3:  Type Correl  Cell  B3  type 0  >  Insert  > Name  >  Define.  Name  Correl 

Thus  the  cells  are  named.  Voll  is 100  times  the  daily  volatility.  Assume 

for  the  example  that  it was  1%  and  enter  1. 

Brownian  Motion  on  a  Spreadsheet,  a  Tutorial 

421 

Next  create  the  covariance  matrix.  It is necessary  to  create  a  2 by 2 ma- 

trix  with  the  following: 

Cell  C1:  type  Cov  Matrix 

Cell  C2:  type  =  Vol1*2 

Cell  D2:  type  =  Correl  X  Voll  x  Vol2 

Cell  C3:  type  =  Correl  X  Vol2  X  Vol1 

Cell  D3:  type  =  Vol242 

Next,  a  special  matrix  called  Cholesky  is needed  to  decompose  the  pre- 
vious  matrix.*  Familiarity  with  such  decomposition  is  not  essential  (see 
Table  A.2). 

Cell  E1:  type  Cholesky 

Cell  E2:  type  =  SQRT(C2) 

Cell  E3:  type  =  C3/E2 

Cell  F3:  type  =  SORT(D3  —  E32) 

Next,  give  names  to  the  Cholesky  matrix: 

Name  E2  a_11 

Name  E3  a_12 

Name  F3  a_22 

Next,  start  looking  at pairs  of returns. 
Then,  to  generate  logarithmic  returns  for  the  securities  that  agree  with 

the  correlation  matrix. 

Cell  G7:  type  REF  A 

Cell  D7:  type  REL  B 

Cell  C8:  type  A8  X  a_11  copy  down  to  cell  C 261

Now  there  are  streams  of  paired  returns.  Since  a22  =  0, returns  B are 

completely  independent  from  returns  A.

circle  is apparent  with  the  density  of the  points  very  high  in  the  cen- 
r  and  diminishing  away  from  it.  Just  as  traders  look  at  the  market  for  a 
distribution  of one  asset  as  a  bell-shaped  curve,‘they  need  to  look  at  that  of 
a  pair  of assets  in concentric  circles.  The  transformation  is shown  in  Figure 
A.5  and  in Figure  A.6. 

Next,  change  the  correlations  and  examine  the  resulting  returns. 
Figure  A.7  shows  that  the  curves  compress  toward  the  center  forming 
one  line  as  the  correlation  increases  toward  one.  As  the  correlation  tends  to- 
ward  negative  one,  again  only  one  line  is forming;  the  returns  will  be  equal 
but  with  opposite  signs. 

Figure  A.8  allows  the  reader  to  compare  the  example  with  correlations 

in  the  real  world.

Risk  Neutrality  Explained  vg 

The  risk-neutral  argument  of financial  theory  is explored  in  this  module.  It 
is  essential  for  the  understanding  any  arbitrage  pricing  of  a  contingent 
claim.  The  reader  needs  to  get a  notion  of it to  comprehend  that  all  proba- 
bilities  used  in the  text  will  be  “tricked”  into  their  risk-neutral  equivalent. 

STEP  1. PROBABILISTIC  FAIRNESS,  THE 
“FAIR  DICE”  AND  THE  SKEW* 

In  this  example,  start  by assuming  an  economy’  without  rates. 

The  expected  payoff  of the  security  is each  final  price  times  its  proba- 
bility.  In  the  example  shown  in  Figure  B.1,  it will  be  101.01  x  .499  +  98.99 
 .501  =  100  minus  the  initial  price,  which  sums  up  to  0.  The  security  is 
therefore  priced  at  a  level  where,  based  on  information  about  possible 
events  and  their  probability,  it constitutes  a  fair  game  for  a  trader. 

On  a binomial  tree,  the  following  equality  would  occur.!

being  satisfied  at  all  times  in  the  economy.  This,  in  a  nutshell,  is called  the 
probability  fairness  or  “no  free  lunch.” 

It has  been  simplified  to  allow  for  discrete  steps  between  prices  in  the 

market. 

at  if there  was  a  skew?  Assume  that  the  market  can  move  up  by a  u 
larger than v. To make  it probability  neutral,  the  larger  size  of 
considerable 
the  up-steps  needs  to  be  compensated  with  a  reduced  probability  of  the 
event. 

In  Figure  B.2,  each  outcome  is  multiplied  by  its  probability:  105.13  x 

165  =  98.99  X  .835  =  100. 

Step  2.  ADDING  THE  REAL  WORLD: 
THE  Risk-NEUTRAL  ARGUMENT 

The  Drift 

Assume  the  asset  that  the  operator  is concerned  with  commanded a rate  of 
return  pw in the  economy.  It would  then  be necessary  to  assume  that  the  ex- 
pected  return  from  holding  the  stock  would  be  »  multiplied  by the  time 
horizon,  p At,  the  “drift”  return.  What  if the  rate  » was  different  from  the 
risk-free  rate in the economy  because  it  includes  a  premium  for  “some- 
thing”  that  could  be  called  risk? 

The  answer  lies  in  the  Black-Scholes-Merton  breakthrough.  There  could 
not  have  been  an  option-pricing  formula  without  the  following  argument: 
Arbitrage  derivation  of security  prices  means  replication.  Option  replication 

428 

Modules 

eliminates  the  delta  and  the  exposure  to  the  asset  change  of direction  (i.e., 
the  return)  and  would  let  the  operator  only  concern  himself  with  the 
volatility  of the  asset  not  its  required  rate  of return,  nor  the  operator’s  risk 
preference.  Black-Scholes-Merton  constituted  a  self-financing  (cash-flow 
neutral)  delta-neutral  portfolio  that  would  attempt  to  replicate  the  option 
through  continuous  rebalancing  (the  buying  and  selling  of the  underlying 
asset  against  buying  or  selling  a  risk-free  bond  with  the  residual  cash  thus 
obtained).  The  value  of the  option  would  then  correspond  to  the  replication 
costs  of  the  portfolio,  themselves  depending  on  the  volatility  of  the  asset 
and  the  risk-free  rate  in  the  economy.  Module  G  includes  a  demonstration 
of the  Black-Scholes-Merton  magic  trick. 

This  leads  to  the  following  result:  For  arbitrage  trading  and  option  val- 
uation,  the  drift  of the  underlying  non-interest-paying  asset  needs  to  be  re- 
placed  by the  risk-neutral  rate  in  the  economy. 

On  this  tree,  one  needs  to  earn  the  “risk-free”  rate  of .11  for  the  period. 
There  are  many  ways  finance  academia  has  adjusted  for  it.  The  first  would 
be to increase  the  difference  between  up-steps  and  down-steps.  The  second, 
for  reasons  that  will  appear  handy  with  the  pricing  of barrier  options,  con- 
sists  in  changing  the  probability  of  every  move  (while  satisfying  that  the 
sum  remains  100%).  Figure  B.3  shows  the  risky  asset  réturns. 

The  operator  tricks  the  distribution  by fictitiously  changing  the  proba- 
bilities  to  make  believe  (for  derivative  security  valuation  purposes  only) 
that  the  expected  payoff  is that  of a  riskless  asset.  This  is called  a  change  of 
probability  measure.  Figure  B.4  shows  the  result. 

Say  that  r  is  the  risk-free  in  the  economy  and  that  the  asset  concerned 

has  an  expected  future  payoff  of w.

The  operator  defines  the  up-and-down  prices: 

S(t +  At)  =  S(t) e" 
S(t +  At)  =  S(t) e 

with  the  following  restriction: 

Pron  bet  At)  (Wp)  1S  (beet)

So  at  the  note  t +  At, the  trader  has 

pe  +  (1= p)e*  =e 

He  creates  a  new  probability  measure  p*, which  should  satisfy  the  fictitious 
replication  values  at  the  same  period: 

pre  al (1 ae p*) ef  =  et 

Option  Wizard:  Why  Traders  Know  the  Risk-Neutral  Argument 

The  risk-neutral  argument  is easier  for traders  to  understand  once  they  consider 
the  simpler  put-call  parity  rules.  Assume  that  the  asset  is expected  to  grow  at 
23%.  The  asset,  however,  can  be  “rolled”  (sold  and  bought  back  to  avoid  de- 
livery)  every  day at  11%  annualized,  the  differential  between  the  financing  and 
its  carry,  which  makes  its  forward  price  one  day hence  lower  by the  annualized 
11%.  If the  call  traded  at  premium  to  the  “roll”  (hence  the  put  at  a  discount  to 
the  “roll”),  then  the  operator  can  sell  the  call,  buy  the  put  and  own  the  asset 
that  would  cost  him  only  11%  per  day  (annualized).  Hence  all  puts  and  calls 
need  to  be  priced  at  the  “roll,”  the  net  of the  risk-free  rates. 

Another  way  to  view  it is to  see  that  the  forward  for  an  asset  is risk  neutral 
(cash  and  carry  makes  it trade  at  the  risk-free  rate  minus  its  yield).  Given  that 
neutrality,  the  puts  and  calls  need  to  synthetically  replicate  the  forward  owing 
to  the  equality  for  European  options: 

Call  —  Put  =  Forward 

“Bullishness”  would  normally  raise  the  value  of  the  call.  But  arbitrage 
would  also  raise  the  value  of the  put,  to  satisfy  the  equality,  which  is a  paradox: 
Bearishness  would  also  raise  the  value  of  the  put.  Hence  one’s  preferences 
should  not  affect  the  option’s  fair  value.

This  gives  a  hint  of the  technique  of changing  the  probability  measure 
to  satisfy  some  purpose.  This  method,  based  on  the Girsanov  theorem’,  will 
present  more  applications  in option  pricing. 

An  option  theory  generalization  is that  the  risk-neutral  drift  used  for  a 
pair  is  the  difference  between  the  two  risk-neutral  drifts.  For  a  dividend- 
paying  stock,  it becomes  the  differential  of carry  (dividend  minus  the  risk- 
free  rate),  for  a  bond  it becomes  the  difference  between  its  carry  and  the 
financing  rate,  and  so  forth.

Numeraire  Relativity  and  the 
Two-Country  Paradox 

oe 

\  mA base  currency  for  an  operator,  also  called  a  numeraire,  is  one  in 
which  his  final  P/L is  expressed.  A countercurrency  is the one that  cor- 
responds  to  the  number  of units  traded. 

numeraire  could  also  be  any  possible  unit.  An  operator  can  have  his  nu- 

meraire  defined  as  a  stock  index  or  a  bond  fund,  as  many  unwittingly  do. 

The  numeraire  problem!  is  well  known  to  option  traders  with  experi- 
ence  in  the  currencies.  Unlike  other  contracts  where  the  trading  is  exclu- 
sively  done  in units  per  dollar  (or, if the  contract  is traded  in France,  in units 
per  French  franc),  trading  in  currencies  is  done  in  pairs  where  the  unit 
could  be  either  of the  two  currencies.  The  relativity  is of the  utmost  impor- 
tance  as  the  hedging  amounts  will  depend  on  the  base  currency. 

The  notion  is counterintuitive  because  in most  people’s  minds  a  currency 
pair is invertible.  A JPY against  the  USD  is the  inverse  of the  USD  against  the 
JPY.  However,  although  the  equality  will  apply  to  the  price,  it will  not  apply 
to  the  profits  and  losses  since  the  P/L  will  be caused  by currencies  diverging 
and  that  such  divergence  will  cause  a  change  in the  yardstick. 

As  will  be seen  a  put on  a  currency  is a  call  on  the  countercurrency.  Like- 
wise,  a  call  on  a  SP500  can  be  viewed  as  a  put on  cash.  The  governing  notion 
that  a  stock  market  can  only  go  to  zero  as  expressed  in  dollar  terms  can  be 
stood  on  its head:  Cash  can  go to  infinite.  For  a SP500-based  person,  a  call  on 
the  index  (put  on  cash)  can  have  a  limited  potential,  while  the  put  on  the 
index  (call  on  cash)  can  have  an  unlimited  upside.  This  notion  is  largely  ig- 
nored  by fund  managers,  to  the  detriment  of their  hedging  precision. 

As  is  the  convention,  the  currencies  in  this  module  are  expressed  in 
pairs,  with  the  first  currency  the  countercurrency  and  the  second  one  the 
base  currency. 

The  following  symbols  are  used  in  the  book  (and  the  market): 

USD  is the  U.S.  dollar. 

DEM  is the  German  mark. 

GBP  is the  British  pound  (the  “G”  stands  for  Great). 

431 

432 

Modules 

ITL  is the  Italian  lira. 

FRE  is the  French  franc. 

SP500  is the  SP500  index. 

USD-DEM  will  therefore  be  the  DEM  units  expressed  in  marks  per  dollar 
(called  the  European  convention).  DEM-USD  will  be  the  dollars  per  mark 
(American  convention).  GBP-USD  is  the  number  of  dollars  one  pound  can 
buy,,GBP-DEM  is the  number  of German  marks  per  pound  sterling. 
7050 will  be  the  SP500  expressed  in  USD  (as  implied).  SP500-GBP  is 
e  GBP-denominated  SP500.  However  a  GBP-SP500  will  be  the  units  of 

pounds  expressed  in units  of SP500. 

Following  is  an  example  outlining  the  importance  of  the  choice  of 

numeraire. 

Example:  Assume  the  operator  is  trading  USD-DEM  (as  is  the  con- 
vention  in  the  over-the-counter  market,  since  worldwide  USD-DEM  is 
quoted  in  dollar,  not  currency,  face  value).  He  buys  10  million  of  US 
dollars  at  1.40  DEM  per  USD.  The  market  rallies  to  1.50  and  he sells  $10 
million.  He  will  have  the  pleasant  profits  of  DEM  1,000,000.  For  a 
dollar-based  entity,  these  profits  need  to  be  hedged,  whereas  for 
a  German  company  there  is  no  risk  since  its  profits  were  in  its  base 
currency. 

‘ 

A  counterexample:  If the  trader  is  dollar-based,  he  would  trade  in- 
stead  14  million  DEM  at  the  inverse  rate  (DEM-USD),  1/1.40  =  .7142. 
Should  the  market  drop  to  .6666,  he  would  sell  back  14 million  DEM  for 
a  profit  of $666,400. 

However,  the  contract  is  defined  in  USD-DEM,  and  the  over-the- 
counter  unit  for  the  currency  is in dollars.  So mentally,  the  trader  would 
go  to  the  market  and  quote  amounts  that  are  constant  foreign  currency. 
In  the  preceding  example,  the  trader  would  have  had  to  trade  $10  mil- 
lion  and  then  exit  by trading  the  dollar  amount  that  represents  a  con- 
stant  14 million  DEM,  namely  $9,333,333. 

Risk  Management  Rule:  A  position  in  a  numeraire  is  considered 
neutral.  A residual  long the numeraire  will  be positive  P/L,  a resid- 
ual  short  the  numeraire  will  be negative  P/L.  By residual  is meant  a 
position  that  arose  from a trade. 

Conversely,  the  hedger  considers  any  position  in a  unit  that  is not  a  nu- 

meraire  to  be an  “open”  position,  long or  short. 

A  DEM  balance  for  a  German  is considered  square,  while  the  U.S.-based 
person  needs  to  have  his  residual  balance  in  USD.  A person  from  a  country 

Numeraire  Relativity  and  the  Two-Country  Paradox 

433 

with  hyperinflation  might  think  of anything  not  denominated  in hard  assets 
as  an  open  position. 

EXTENSION:  THE  Two-COUNTRY  PARADOX 

Two  traders  (one  German  and  one  American)  were  discussing  dollar-mark 
(USD-DEM).  The  dollar  was  trading  then  at  1.42  and  volatility  was  high.  In- 
terest  rates  were  equal  so  the  forward  traded  at  “flat”  with  the  cash,  namely 
1.42.  Both  had  a  view  on  the  other’s  currency  being  weaker.  Both  were  some- 
how  right. 

Consider  the  following  (the  reader  should  examine  the  description  of 
the  Brownian  motion  that  asset  prices  are  assumed  to  follow):  Assume  that 
assets  follow  the  log normal  distribution  with  expected  volatility  20%  per 
annum. 

The  risk  neutrality  forces  the  operator  to  have  the  expected  price  at  any 

time  in the  future,  given  the  spot,  equal  to  the  spot.  This  leads  to: 

Price  period  t =  up-price  period  (f +  1) X  probability  of going  up 

+  down-price  period  (t +  1) <  probability  of going  down. 

Or: 

See  or  1p  or  1). (bp) 

with  S_ the  up-price,  S, the  down-price,  p the  probability  of going  up,  1 —  p 
that  of going  down  since  the  sum  of both  should  be equal  to  1. 

The  operator  has  as  the  process  followed  by spot  (as explained  in  Mod- 

ule  G): 

which  solves  for  p 

S  (f+  1) =  S(t) exp(o  Vt) 

u 

S(t  +  1) =  S(t) exp(  -o  V4) 

Pe  (lead)  (ad) 

with 

u  =  exp  (o Vt) and d =  exp  —e  Vt) 

So  a  tree  can  be built  with  two  six-month  nodes: 

1.  The  asset  price  at  the  preceding  node  x  Exp(+  .20  x  Sqrt(.5))  with  a 

probability  of 46.47%. 

2.  The  asset  price  at  the  preceding  node  x  Exp(—  .20  x  Sqrt(.5))  with  a 

probability  of 53.52%.

The  expected  final  asset  price  is  computed  by the  final  outcome  times 

its  probability.  Table  C.1  shows  the  German’s  position. 

So  far  so  good:  The  German  expects  his  currency,  in the  absence  of drift 
and  interest  rate  differential,  to  remain  the  same  at  the  end  of one  year.  To 
see  at  every  node  what  he  expects  the  inverse  of  dollar-mark  to  do,  one 
would  take  the  same  table  and  replace  dollar-mark  by  1/dollar-mark  (see 
Table  C.2).  The  first  cell  will  be  1/1.42  =  .7042. 

So  the  German  expects  his  currency  to  remain  the  same  in dollar-mark 
terms,  but  to  appreciate  considerably  in mark-dollar  terms.  This  paradox  is 
rather  unsettling in  a  global  economy. 

Table  C.3  shows  the  marks  per  dollar  point  a view.  Table  C.4  shows  the 

reverse  at every  node. 

The  American,  too  believes  that  his  currency  would  increase  against  the 

other’s. 

Chapters  7 and  17 present  an  extension  of the  paradox:  A call  on  dollar- 
mark  will  therefore  not  have  the  same  delta  as  a  put on  mark-dollar.  An  in- 
tuitive  way  to  see  it  is  by  considering  a  move  up  in  dollar-mark  to  the 
infinite.  For  a  dollar-based  investor,  the  move  in  the  currencies  is  down  to 
zero,  therefore  limited.

price  equivalent  (except  for  Asian  and  digital  options),  but  the  delta  will  be 
different.* 

Conclusion 

Any risk  manager  /trader  should  be  aware  of the  real,  true  numeraire  before 
proceeding  to  analyze  and  measure  risks.  This  issue  crops  up  at  either  a 
higher  volatility  or  in  situations  where  many  pairs  are  traded  against  each 
other  without  any  dominant  home  currency.

Correlation  Triangles:  A Graphical 
Case  Study 

This  section  is necessary  preparation  for  the  analysis  of multiasset  options.' 
The  analysis  is limited  to  implied  volatility  and  correlations  stemming  from 
European  options. 

Assets  can  be  represented  for  delivery  in  a  given  maturity  (the  assets 
emselves,  not  the  quoted  pairs),  as  points  in  a  Euclidean  space.  The  “dis- 
tance”  between  the  points  will  correspond  to  the  implied  volatility  between 
them.  This  method  can  facilitate  the  understanding  of the  relationships  be- 
tween  volatilities  and  the  effect  the  correlation  has  on  aJl the  possible  pairs. 
The  definition  of  an  asset  for  that  purpose  is  a  unit  that  needs  to  be 
paired  with  some  other  unit  for  it  to  become  tradable.  So  corn  could  be  an 
asset,  gold  another  asset,  the  U.S.  dollar  a  third  one.  One  could  easily  see  a 
contract  defined  as  an  option  for  corn  against  gold,  a  vanilla  product  for indi- 
viduals  whose  home  currency  is corn  or  gold. 

It is always  easier  to  analyze  currencies  in  that  light  because  currencies 
lend  themselves  very  well  to  changes  in  numeraire.  A  currency  trader  can 
easily  see  a  dollar-yen  option  on  the  same  footing  as  a  yen-Mongolian  Tugrit. 
A currency,  by definition,  is  a numeraire,  but  so  could  any  other  unit,  includ- 
ing  baseball  tickets,  for  those  who  are  too  centered  on  the  matter  and  see 
everything  else  translated  into  baseball  ticket  equivalence. 

The  implied  volatility  of  a  pair  (for  a  given  maturity)  is  measured 
with  the  distance  between  the  points  represented  by their  coordi- 
nates  in a  Euclidean  space. 

e  Ina  two-dimensional  universe,  the  formula  of the  distance  between 

two  assets  with  coordinates  (x,,x,)  and  (y,,y,)  is

It is easy  for  the  mathematical  stickler  to  see  that  the  volatility  function 
thus  defined  satisfies  the  conditions  for  a  metric,  or  distance  function. 
Hence,  v(x,y)  will  represent  the  volatility 
of  the  tradable  pair  x-y,  or x in 
terms  of units  of y:

1.  v(x, y) is strictly  positive  if x  is different  from  y. In addition,  o(x,x)  = 
_0: The  volatility  of  the  asset  expressed  in  terms  of  itself  as  a  nu- 
meraire  is nil.  It suffices  to  see  that  the  volatility  of cash  in  terms  of 
cash  is 0.

ace  (the  one-month  space)  with  coordinates  {7,12.12}.  Also  pick  USD  to  be 
(0,0).  It  is  always  recommended,  for  the  sake  of  simplicity,  to  use  the  point 
(0,0)  for  the  numeraire,  the  commodity  in which  the  P/L  is computed. 

ee. conform  to  market  standards,  the  notation  v(x,y)  will  be  used  to 
rite  v(x_y),  which  should  read  “volatility  of  the  pair  x_y”.  v(USD-DEM), 
the  metric  between  point  {0,0}  and  the  point  {7,12.12}  shown  in_Figure  D1 
will  be  V7?  +  12.12?  =  14,  which  puts  the  USD-DEM  volatility  at  14%  (ex- 
ample  is  rescaled  by  100  for  simplicity).  By  the  same  token,  the  v(DEM-

It  is  easy  to  see  that  correlation  (x-n,  y-n)  =  correlation  (n-x,  n-y);  in  other 
words,  the  correlation  between  the  asset  x  measured  against  the  numeraire 
n  and  the  asset  y measured  against  the  numeraire  n  is  equal  to  the  correla- 
tion  between  the  asset  n  measured  against  the  numeraire  x  and  the  asset  n 
measured  against  the  numeraire  y. 

It is now  possible  to  return  to  the  example  and  calculate  the  correlations 
imparted  by the  three-currency  world.  Compute  the  correlation  between 
USD-DEM  segment  and  the  USD-JPY: 

Corr(DEM-USD,JPY-USD)  =  (7 —  0)(11  —  0) 

+  (12.12  —  0)(4.79  —  0)/V(49  +  146.89)  V(121  +  22.94)  =  .8035 

Corr(DEM-JPY/USD-DEM)  =  .52 

Corr(DEM-JPY/USD-DEM)  =  .09 

For  correlation  to  remain  constant,  the  volatilities  of the  sides  should  in- 
crease  by the  same  percentage  amount  (Figure  D.4).  This  would  cause  the

third  volatility  to  increase  as  well.  It  is  somewhat  hard  to  imagine  that 
DEM-JPY  now  increases  in  volatility  because  both  components  gained  in 
volatility  against  the  dollar.  This  author  spent  some  precious  time  trying  to 
convince  fellow  colleagues  who  were  reluctant  to  accept  the  notion. 

Furthermore,  when  the  third  leg rotates  (as  in  Figure  D.5),  the  volatili- 

ties  remain  constant  and  correlation  shifts.

mare by 1. Including  the  GBP  requires  adding  one  dimension  to  all  the 
others.  Using  an  {x,y,z}  coordinate  system,  the  result  (displayed  in  Figure 
D.6)  is 

USD(numeraire)  =  {0,0,0}

What if  a user  added  the  SP500?  He  would  now  have  five  units,  four  dimen- 
sions  for  a  possible  representation.  However,  he  could  eliminate  one  unit 
every  time  for  representation  purposes. 

The  trader  represents  the  subuniverse  USD,SP,DEM,JPY  (without  the 
GBP).  He  removes  the  third  line  accordingly  for  the  representation,  repre- 
senting  (n1,n2,n4)  to  accommodate  the  fact  that  even  traders  can  only  view 
the  world  in three  dimensions. 

USD = {0,0,0} 
DEM = {7,12.12,0} 
JPY  =  {11,4.79,0} 
SP  =  {0,0,10} 

The  pair  SP500-USD  satisfies  no  correlation  with  any  other  segment.  The 
reader  could,  as  an  exercise,  verify  that.  The  implication  is  apparent,  as 
corr(2  segments)  =  0 infers  the  cos(angle)  =  0, which  results  in a  right angle 
between  SP-USD  and  JPY-USD,  as  well  as  with  SP-USD  and  DEM-USD,  as 
shown  in  Figure  D.7. 

Result:  The  world  of  volatilities  can  be  represented  as  a  universe  of 

points. 

Absence  of volatility/correlation  arbitrage  requires  that  all  the  volatili- 
ties  in  the  market  (and  the  correlations  stemming  from  it) satisfy  the  same 
metric  between  points.  Any  shift  of  a  point  to  the  left,  right,  up,  or  down 
should  then  result  in  arbitrage.

The  Value-at-Risk 

Ve 

Abyssus  abyssum  invocat  (The  abyss  calls  for  the  abyss).! 

Latin  Proverb 

Below  is a  presentation  of a  risk  management  method  that,  like  portfolio  in- 
surance,  can  only  work  if a  small  number  of people  are  using  it.  It is  a  para- 
dox,  discussed  in Taleb  (1997),  that  states  that  it can  only work  (and  succeed) 
if it is unsuccessful. 

@  Value-at-risk*  is  a method  of estimating  the  maximum  loss  for  a portfolio 
at  a  confidence  level  assuming  a  knowledge  of the  process  governing  its 
components. 

The  VAR  can  present  some  useful  short-term  hedging  tools  for  traders,  as 
we  examined  with  the  discussion  on  stacking  in Chapter  12.  However,  it led 
to  seriously  disputed  applications  by risk  management  firms  that  led  (per- 
haps  innocently)  their  customers  to  believe  they possessed  tools  to  summa- 
rize  the  overall  market  risks  for  a  position,  a  unit,  a department,  or  an  entire 
firm,  in  one  simplified  numerical  exposure,  without  standard  error. 

As  the  concept  is evolving  in  its  applications,  the  presentation  here  will 

be limited  to  a  rapid  intuitive  exposition. 

Value-at-risk’  is  growing  in  use  among  the  banks  and  corporations  both 
for  adequate  risk  allocation  and  appropriate  quantification  of  the  risk- 
adjusted  returns  on  capital.  The  idea  of disclosing  the  overall  exposure  as  one 
simple  quantity  appeals  to  most  corporate  board  members  and  regulators, 
many  of whom  are  uninitiated  into  the  nuances  and  complexities  of financial 
market  risks.  They  can  easily  be  impressed  by the  “scientific”  tools  used. 

The  condensation  of complex  factors  naturally  does  not  just  affect  the 
accuracy  of the  measure.  Critics  of VAR  (including  the  author)  argue  that 
simplification  could  result  in such  distortions  as  to  nullify  the  value  of the 
measurement.  Furthermore,  it can  lead  to  charlatanism:  Lulling  an  innocent 
investor  or  business  manager  into  a  false  sense  of security  could  be a seri- 
ous  breach  of  faith.  Operators  are  dealing  with  unstable  parameters,  un- 
like  those  of the  physical  sciences,  and  risk  measurement  should  not  just be 
understood  to be a  vague  and  imprecise  estimate.  This  approach  can  easily 
lead  to  distortions.  The  most  nefarious  effect  of  the  VAR  is  that  it has  al- 
lowed  people  who  have  never  had  any  exposure  to  market  risks  to  express 
their  opinion  on  the  matter. 

445

In brief,  it cannot  be  used  to  say,  “Within  99.7%  (or within  90%  or  some- 
thing  of the  sort),  you  are  not  expected  to  lose  in  the  next  month  more  than 
1 million  dollars.”  The  innocent  treasurer  or  company  official  would  believe 
himself  to  be  listening  to  a  scientific  statistic  similar  to  statistics  on  air- 
plane  crashes.  It could,  however,  be  used  to  say:  “ You  are  expected  to  lose 
no  more  than  100,000  dollars  within  the  next  two  hours  with  a  66%  accu- 
racy,  provided  you  do  not  try to  liquidate  your  position  and  the  other  simi- 
lar  firms  do  not  have  the  same  portfolio.” 

SIMPLIFIED  EXAMPLES 

In  these  examples,  the  VAR  corresponds  to  the  risk  for  1 standard  devia- 
tion  (66%  of the  time),  not  3 standard  deviations  as  expressed  in  the  com- 
mon  literature. 

Assume  for  this  series  of examples  that  the  universe  offered  to  a  trading 

desk  is composed  of the  following  four  items: 

USD-DEM:  USD  against  the  German  mark  currency  pair  as  quoted  in 
the  interbank  market. 

7 

USD-JPY:  USD  against  the  Japanese  yen  currency  pair  as  quoted  in  the 
interbank  market. 

Treasury  Bond  futures:  As  traded  on  the Chicago  Board  of Trade  (the ex- 
ample  translates  units  into  face  value  exposure). 

SP500  Index  futures:  As  quoted  on  the  Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange. 

The  example  uses  data  as  of May  23,  1995. 
Annualized  nine-month  historical  volatilities  (percentage)  are  as  follows:

The  Value  at  Risk 

447 

Example  1.  No  Diversification 

"a 

The  trader  has  a  $20  million  face  value  limit  and  decides  to  invest  in  going 
long  one  of  the  four  instruments,  but  does  not  know  which  one.  Table  E.2 
shows  the  net  exposure  that  would  correspond  to  each  undiversified  posi- 
tion.  The  net  exposure  is defined  arbitrarily  for  one  daily  standard  deviation 
of the  moves  in  the  market,  which  should  (in theory,  unless  the  distribution 
changes)  represent  67%  of all events.  It should  also  resemble  the  average  daily 
swing  in  the  portfolio.  Should  the  trader  decide  to  include  wider  events,  like 
3 standard  deviations,  he  could  multiply  the  exposure  by 3:  It  would  then 
show  the  total  maximum  possible  loss  with  a  99.7%  confidence.  However,  the 
management  of that  trader  has  heard  of fat tails  and  prefers  to  see  1 standard 
deviation  as  a  benchmark  for  a  comparative  purpose. 

Example  2.  A Cross-Position 

The  trader  might  desire  to  get involved  in cross-positions.  Would  he benefit 
from  a  positive  correlation? 

It is apparent  here  that  the  VAR  stemming  from  a  cross-currency  position 
as  shown  in  Table  E.3,  owing  to  the  higher  correlation  of  changes  between 
dollar/mark  and  dollar/yen  would  correspond  to  71%  of  the  risk  of  a 
dollar /mark  position. 

Obviously,  the  diversification  works.  Since  he  has  not  fully  drawn  on 
his  gross  limit,  he can  add  to  the  position  and  utilize  the  balance  of $10 mil- 
lion  in  a  diversified  manner  (Table  E.4). 

The  overall  position  is  thus  reduced  from  the  undiversified  Example  1: 
The  capital  at  risk  for  1 standard  deviation  corresponds  to  at  least  half  the 
risks  of any  of the  initial  four  positions.

While  the  normality  assumption  could  be  acceptable  for  some  applica- 
tions,  such  as  the  pricing  of  at-the-money  options,  such  approximation  of 
the  distribution  could  be  considered  inappropriate  for  the  measurement  of 
“worst-case”  risks.  Risks  are  located  in  the  tails,  which  is where  the  distri- 
bution  is the  least  known. 

Assuming  that  the  volatility  of markets  is not  constant,  the  rule  of the  o

In  addition,  correlations  not  being  constant  (as  dicussed  in  Chapter  6), 

the  “joint  tails”  of several  assets  are  fuzzier  to  model.

Problem  2.  Liquidity  Risks. 
(This  argument  is  developed  in  Chapter  4.) 
The  VAR  method  makes  no  allowance  for  the  fact  that  liquidity  could  repre- 
sent  the  largest  risks  in  some  markets.  In  some  less  mature  instruments, 
liquidity  costs  become  indistinguishable  from  market  risk.  The  selling  of a 
large  block  of  securities,  particularly  in  the  event  of  a  forced  liquidation, 
can  lead  to  total  market  collapse. 

Those  not  interested  in  the  liquidation  value  of their  portfolio  need  not 

be concerned  about  its  market  price  risk. 

Problem  3.  Behavior  of  Parameters  at  Times  of  Stress. 
The  essence  of 
the  VAR  concept  is correlation  and  diversification.  The  widespread  use  of 
these  techniques  leads  to  the  simultaneous  breakdown  of both  at  times  of 
excessive  stress  in  the  markets.  Typically,  low  correlation  between  assets

market  crash”  of 1994  as  all  the  bond  markets  sank  together.  Similarly,  the 
high  correlation  drops  abruptly,  sometimes  even  turning  negative,  in  the 
face  of  such  events:  The  cross-maturity  hedges  cease  to  work.  The  yield 
curves  shift,  often  causing  nonpredicted  deformations,  at  times  of  high 
volatility. 

There  is  a  significant  conflict  between  a  multiasset  risk  model  and  the 
stress-testing  approach.  One  relies  on  known  relationships  while  the  sec- 
ond  has  grounding  in a statistics-free  world.  Relying  exclusively  on  the  first 
would  mislead  grossly  at  times  of  uncertainty.  Relying  exclusively  on  the 
second  would  prevent  firms  from  trading. 

Problem  4.  Dangers  of  Generalized  Use.  Assume  that  everyone  used  the 
value  at  risk  and  that  the  market  moved  abruptly.  The  fact  that  such  a  sys- 
tem  became  a benchmark  would  cause  a  snowball  effect. 

The  chain  would  be  as  follows:  In  a  schematic  world  of a  small  number 
of homogeneous  leveraged  players,  everyone  would  end  up  with  close  to  the 
same  portfolio  constitution  and  weights  owing  to  the  diversification  scheme 
(the  optimal  portfolio)  {A,B,C}  with  weights  Wi 7 Wp,  I  such  a  way  that 
they  reduced  their  risks  to  fit  the  optimal  allocation.  They  would  all  invest 
more  lulled  with  the  knowledge  of  being  comfortably  diversified  as  they 
were  properly  taught by the  risk  management  consultant. 

Assume  that  A went  down  in  price  causing  the  total  portfolios  to  drop 
in  value.  Assume  that  the  volatility  of A increased.  To  maintain  a  constant 
VAR,  the  weights  would  need  to  be  adjusted  down,  so  the  operator  would 
have  to  sell  some  stocks  of B and  C.  The  quantities,  though  small,  would  be 
large enough  to push prices  lower  and  make  operators  race  each  other  to  the 
state  of near-bankruptcy.  The  factor  would  cause  the  correlation  between 
the  components  to  rise,  weakening  the  diversification  effect  in  an  unex- 
pected  way.  The  same  effect  would  take  place  if one  of the  weights  is nega- 
tive  and  the  operators  are  “hedging.”  An  interesting  parameter  in hedges  is 
that  they  only  work  when  they  are  not  identified  as  hedges  by the  multi- 
tude.  If most  other  similar  institutions  needed  to  act  in a  similar  manner  in 
similar  circumstances,  there  would  be  a  dynamical  system  traders  would 
need  to  account  for.*

Problem  5.  Computational  Problems. 
Severe  computational  issues  are  as- 
sociated  with  the  VAR.  Large  firms  do not  cumulate  all their  position  in one

place  from  where  they  could  be  retrieved  easily  and  in  a  timely  way.  Miss- 
ing one  simple  position  could  cause  sufficient  distortions  to  invalidate  the 
measurements.  The  way  the  VAR  is computed  makes  it necessary  to  merge 
all  the  individual  positions  together,  not  add  up  the  VAR  of  different  de- 
partments  and  branches. 

Again,  the  value  at  risk  of a  sum  is not  the  sum  of the  VARs.  Despite  the 
sophistication  of operators,  most  active  firms  experience  data-gathering  lags. 
The  complexity  of  their  operations  led  them  to  account  for  units  by using  a 
pyramid  of net  numbers.  The  VAR  project  would  necessitate  the  handling  of 
every  single  position  in  every  single  branch,  not  easy  for  institutions  with  a 
large network. 

Another  problem  arises  when  the  instruments  become  too  numerous, 
creating  a  large  matrix.  Estimating  the  covariances  will  create  some  round- 
ing  and  estimation  errors,  and  when  such  errors  cumulate,  they  will  pre- 
vent  the  matrices  from  being  positive  definite.  This  makes  large  matrices 
impracticable.° 

Problem  6. What  Is  Volatility? 
So  far,  volatility  has  been  discussed  as  if it 
were  some  observed  physical  phenomenon.  Because  it  is  unstable,  traders 
need  to  consider  modeling  and  all  the  resulting  problems.  Which  volatility? 
Implied  or  historical?  Over  which  horizon?  and  so  on. 

Problem  7.  Do  Not  Even  Dream  of Applying  It to  Derivatives. 
The  sub- 
ject  matter  of  this  book  stresses  the  difficult  interplay  of  parameters 
traders  must  face  in evaluating  the  risks  of an  option  position,  owing  to  its 
multidimensional  nonlinearity.  The  notion  of higher  moments  also  under- 
scores  that  there  is no  way  of tracking  the  risks  of complex  portfolios  with 
one  simplified  Greek. 

Conclusions.  Many  efforts  are  under  way  to  correct  the  inherent  defects 
of  the  system.  Most  promising  results,  typically  in  the  shape  of  nonpara- 
metric  methods  for  stress  testing,  are  presently  outside  the  public  domain.

Probabilistic  Rankings  in Arbitrage 

RANKING  OF  SECURITIES 

The  value  of a  security  can  be established  by ranking.  If security  A is worth 
more  than  security  B and  less  than  security  C, a  book  runner  can  thus  get 
some  orientation  on  how  to  price  it.  This  is  particularly  easy  when  the 
prices  are  readily  available  for  the  comparative  “straddling”  securities  and 
when 

the  comparative  securities  are  close  in price  to  each  other. 

This  instrument 

pricing  and  hedging  method  is  based  on  the  rule  of»

used  to  price  options  given  the  availability  of  other  prices  in  the  market. ) 
They  certainly  can  be  extended  to  portfolio  management. 

European  Option  Rules 

The  following  notation  will  be  used:  C(S,  t) is  a European  call  expiring  pe-- 
riod  t with  a  strike price  S.  P(S,  t) is  a European  put.  A  C(S,  t, H,) is a  call 
with  a  barrier  below  the  market  (down  and  out)  at  a  price  H, and  a  C(S,  ft, 
H,,) is a  call  with  a  barrier  higher  than  market  (up and  out)  at price  H,,, also 
called  a  reverse  knock-out.  A call  (S, t, H,, H,,) is a  double  barrier: 

—_— 

uw  CS )=Cc6 ba?) 

A  101  call  will  be  worth  more  than  a  102  call  of the  same  expiration  under 
all  circumstances.  This  rule  is obvious: 

S/ PS +0, 1) =  POS, 2) 

A  101  put will  be  worth  more  than  a  100  put under  all  circumstances. 

The  butterfly  rules:

454 

Modules 

Two  101  calls  are  worth  less  than  one  100  call  and  one  102  call  together.  It 
means  that  the  100/101/102  butterfly  should  be  worth  at  least  0. The  reason 
is that  it will  have  a  value  of 0 everywhere  except  in the  “eye”;  at the  center,  it 
may  have a value  of 1. 
By put/call  parity:

Two  puts  at  101  should  be worth  more  than  one  100  put and  one  102  put 

together. 

These  rules  may  seem  simplistic  but  veteran  option  traders  on  the  ex- 
changes  who  pride  themselves  on  trading  without  “sheets”  have  been  able  to 
operate  by these  butterfly  rules  alone.  They  can  price  the  entire  spectrum 
using  a  small  number  of options.

(In present  value:  It is more  appropriate  to  deduct  financing.) 

This  means  that  a  longer  straddle  should  be  worth  more  than  a  shorter 
one,  after  taking  financing  into  account.  The  rule  always  holds  for  “serial” 
options,  options  on  only  1  future  (like  a  1-month  2-month  option  on  a  3- 
month  future).  It does  not  unconditionally  apply  to  options  where  the  under- 
lying  security  S is  not  “fixed,”  and  such  weakness  gets  exacerbated  with 
nonfungible  assets  (i.e.,  live  cattle.  Exceptions  can  occur  when a security  can- 
not  be swapped  into  a  longer  maturity). 

Barrier  and  Digital  Rules 

An  American  digital  is  worth  more  than  a  European  one.  An  American  dig- 
ital of the “if 
touched” variety where  the bet  is satisfied if some  event  takes 
place  at  all  times  during  the  life  of the  instrument  is worth  more  than  a  bet 
that  an  event  would  take  place  at  expiration  only. 

Example:  A note  that  pays  off  one  dollar  if the  security  goes  above  103 
at  any  point  in the  next  year  is worth  more  than a note  that  pays  off  one 
dollar  if the  security  is above  103  on  expiration  day:

The  possible  currencies  are  Currency  A  (used  for  numeraire),  Currency  —

areas 
for  the  pair A against  B.

It  implies  that  given  three  security  pairs,  implied  volatility  between 
them  cannot  be  such  that  one  of  the  implied  correlations  exceeds  1 in  ab- 
solute  value. 

Furthermore,  by the  rule  of contamination,  no  combination  between  op- 
tions  should  allow  for  a  combination  yielding  a  correlation  higher  than  1 in 
absolute  value. 

Warning.  This  does  not  represent  full  arbitrage  (i.e.,  a locked-in  profit 
or  loss)  since  the  P/L  of combinations  with  the  numeraire  can  be predicted 
with  certainty,  whereas  the  “cross”  (in  this  case,  DEM-FRF  for  a  dollar- 
based  person)  can  yield  a  P/L  that  depends  on  the  performance  of the  com- 
ponents  with  respect  to  the  base  currency. 

A  generalization  based  on  the  preceding  is  that  an  implied  covariance 
matrix  (implied  from  at-the-money  option  prices)  needs  to be positive  defi- 
nite  (its  eigenvalues  need  to  be  positive  definite).  It is  an  extension  of  the 
boundary  rules  for  a  three-currency  world.  Otherwise  an  operator  would 
be able  to  arbitrage  it by getting  some  combination  of options  for  free  (or for 
a  credit).

It is  easy  to  check  whether  the  matrix  is  “clean,”  or  arbitragé-free.  As 
volatility  cannot  possibly  be negative,  } needs  to be positive  definite,  which 
requires  the  eigenvalues  to  be  positive.  In  this  example,  the  aberrations  for 
a  2 by 2 matrix  can  be  visible  to  the  naked  eye  while  those  of a  20 by 20 ma- 
trix  would  require  computer  crunching. 

In  the  next  example,  there  are  restrictions  on  one  of  the  elements  the 
matrix  (considering  it to  be  symmetric  with  covariance  1, 2 =  covariance 
2,  1).  Assume  that  vol  USD-DEM  is  14%  and  DEM-FREF  (the  cross)  is  4%. 
Then  the  restriction  is on  USD-FRF  to  be  between  10%  and  18%.  Outside 
that  band,  arbitrages  are  possible.  Below  10%,  an  operator  could  buy  the 
USD-FRF  and  DEM-FRF  volatilities  and  sell  the  USD-DEM.  He  would  be 
completely  bounded  as  this  operation  is equivalent  to being  “short”  corre- 
lation  at  1. Any drop  in correlation  at any  time  between  the  two  currencies 
would  benefit  the  trader. 

Probabilistic  Rankings  in Arbitrage

Likewise,  “buying”  correlation  at  —1  could  be  perfected  by  buying 
USD-DEM  at  14%,  buying  DEM-FRF  at  4%,  and  selling  USD-FRF  at  18%. 
Any rise  in the  correlation  above  —1  would  result  in profits. 

A more  involved  matrix  can  be  created  by adding  a  security  to  the  ma- 
trix.  It becomes  much  more  difficult  to  see  with  a  naked  eye  the  implica- 
tions  of an  arbitrage-free  situation:

assets  23  and  32  FRF-CHF.  With  vol  USD-DEM  at  15%,  USD-FRF  at  12%, 
USD-CHF  at  18%  and  crosses  USD-FRF  at 4%, CHF-FRF  at 6%  and  DEM-CHF 
5%,  one  of the  eigenvalues  flags  a  negative  number  that  causes  the  computer 
to beep.  The  matrix  above  is faulty.  The  arbitrage  can  be constructed  through 
a  combination  of options. 

Remember  that  enough  currencies  are  there  to  allow  for  some  arbitrage, 

or  at  least  to  construct  a  trade  with  a  high expected  return. 

Warning.  The  rule  of the  positive  eigenvalues  does  not  hold  for  a  com- 
parison  between  implied  volatilities  of  options  that  are  not  at-the-money 
forward.

everything  else  being  equal.  Say  that  a  trader  in  a  three-asset  world  pays 
11%  for  USD-FRF  and  4%  for  DEM-FRF  and  sells  USD-DEM  at  14%.  He  re- 
ally  disbursed  the  equivalent  of one  volatility,  or  sold  correlation  at  97%.  It 
is an  application  of the  following  formula: 

© cross  ra \o ”  o; a  2p, 

from  which  is derived  a  correlation  p of .97. 

In the  real  world,  correlations  are  unstable.  Therefore,  a  trade  that  has  a 
better  chance  of benefiting  from  changes  in  correlation  than  losing  from  it 
is of higher  grade  than  a  trade  that  presents  the  opposite  characteristic.

GENERAL  CONVEXITY  RULES 

Risk  Management  Rule:  A security  that  is convex  with  respect  toa 
nonconstant  parameter  should,  everything  else  being  equal,  be 
security  that  is not  as  convex  with  respect  to  the 
worth  more  thana 
same  parameter. 

In  a  flat-yield-curve  environment  and  assuming  the  back-month  matu- 
rities  have  the  same  volatility,  it is preferable  to  own  the bond  with  the  high- 
est  convexity. 

A corollary  is that  a  portfolio  of options  that  presents  a  symmetric  con- 
vexity  in its  vega  is worth  more  than a similar  portfolio  that  presents  none. 

_ Phan Two  portfolios  are  long  vega  in  the  amount  of  $100,000  per 
volatility  point  (from  16%  down  to  15%).  Portfolio  A’s  vega  increases  as 
\S 
volatility  rallies  and  decreases  in  a  sell-off,  while  portfolio  B’s  vega  de- 
creases  in the  rally and  increases  in a sell-off.  On  that  account  alone,  the 
options  that  constitute  portfolio  A  are  more  valfiable  than  those  that 
constitute  portfolio  B. 

t is preferable  to  be  square  vega  and  own  the  second  derivative  of 
ega  than  have  a  position  (through  binary  options  hedged  with  vanilla) 
that  loses  money  when  vega  moves.  These  instruments  are  therefore 
deemed  “inferior.” 

<isk  Management  Rule:  A portfolio  of options  that  presents  sym- 
metric  convexity  in  its  vega  with  respect  to  underlying  A  is worth 
more  than  a  similar  portfolio  of options  of the  same  symmetric  con- 
vexity  with  respect  to  underlying  B  if  underlying  B is  less  het- 
eroskedastic  than  underlying  A. 

A portfolio  of options  long  vega  through  shorting  a  barrier  op- 
tion  is  less  valuable  than  a  portfolio  of  options  that  is  long  vega 
through  out-of-the-money  options.

Iro’s  LEMMA  EXPLAINED 

Ito’s  lemma  is an  important  tool  in option  pricing.  Without  spending  an  ex- 
cessive  amount  of time  on  theory,  this  module  will  provide  a  heuristic  defi- 
nition,  couching  as  much  of  it  as  possible  in  terms  practitioners  can 
understand. 

The  gist  of  Ito’s  method  is  that  a  function  of  a  random  walk  (not 
smooth)  is smooth  and  differentiable.  The  module  of the  Brownian  motion 
on  a  spreadsheet  (Module  A)  goes  into  the  details  of  the  lack  of  smooth- 
ness. 

The  random  walk  has  already  been  intuitively  defined: 

AW  =  W(t  +  At)  —  W(t)  =  n(W,  HAt  +  o(W,  HAZ 

(1) 

with  AZ  =  VAt  U(0,  1), U(0,  1) ani.i.d.  process  following  a  normal  distribu- 
tion!  with  mean  0 and  unit  variance.  The  shortcuts  o  and  pw for  o(W,  ft) and 
w(W,  t) will  be  used. 

Equation  (1) means  that  the  change  in  W, over  time  Aft,  is composed  of a 
drift  and  of a  stochastic  element  the  magnitude  of which  is  determined  by 
the  variance. 

It is established  that  no  matter  how  small  one  defines  the  increments  Af, 
the  function  will  not  be  smooth  anywhere.  It  will  remain  jagged  and 
nowhere  differentiable.  This  is  analogous  to  a  coastline  that  no  one  can  ac- 
curately  measure  because  of its  infinite  jaggedness. 

Select  time  in  tranches  so  small  that  any  smaller  increment  would  be  0. 

Anything  that  is multiplied  by time  would  vanish. 

It is possible  to  check  that: 

E(AW)  =  pAt since  E(AZ)  =  0 
V(AW)  =  E{AW)  —  E(AW)?}?  =  E{0  +  o2At  U2} 

SO 

V(AW)  =  o2At

at the  limit.  This  differential  form  should  be always  seen  as  a  shorthand  for 
a  stochastic  integral,  not  a  true  partial  differential  equation. 

Let  F(W,  t) be a  security  that  is function  of both  W and  time.  Expanding,

With  the  results,  operators  can  proceed  to  price  options,  in several  ways. 

¢  By using  the  Black-Scholes  (1973)  argument  of delta  neutrality  lead- 
ing us  to  ignore  the  utility  curve  of operators  and  possible  risk  pre- 
miums  establishing  that  ~  =r.  The  argument  will  be  displayed 
further  down. 

e  A  more  modern  method  consists  in  using  the  Harrison  and  Kreps 
(1979)  and  Harrison  and  Pliska  (1981)  generalization  that  allows  the 
extension  of the  previous  argument  to  any  type  of contingent  claims, 
under  some  conditions  of market  completeness  (as far  as  all  of the  in- 
strument  affecting  the  derivative  are  concerned)  that  can  easily  be 
summarized  as:  allowing full  replication  through  dynamic  (hence  static) 
hedging. 

¢  Other  methods,  such  as  Feynman-Kac,  which  are  being  used  in mod- 
ern  finance  to  integrate  Ito’s  lemma  and  derive  an  underlying  pro- 
cess  under  risk-neutralized  paths.

Modules 

The  Feynman-Kac  solution  of a  large class  of stochastic  differential  equa- 
tions  as  the  probabilistic  expectation  of  a  function  (under  some  regularity 
conditions  on  the  drift  and  the  variance,  see  Dana  and  Jeanblanc-Piqué,  1994 
for  a  clear  review)  allows  operators  to  use  probabilistic  methods,  rather 
than  the  more  burdening  (and  less  intuitive)  partial  differential  equations, 
in order  to  tackle  option  pricing.  More  simply,  one  can  price  a  path indepen- 
dent  option  (and a large  class  of soft  path  dependent  options  such  as  barri- 
ers)  as  the  expectation  of the  terminal  payoff  assuming  that  the  asset  price 
follows  a  risk  neutral  diffusion.  The  solution  is then  said  that 

exp  (1 (t ~  ty) E2 (f(S)} 

for  a  path independent  option,  and 

exp  nS  iE  iS) /  ia) 

for  a  soft  path  dependent  one  (like  a  barrier),  with  Q the  risk  neutral  proba- 
bility  measure,  f(S)  the  final  payoff  function,  t the  time  to  expiration  and  1 
the  stopping  time  (when  hitting  the  barrier).  It facilitates  Monte  Carlo  meth- 
ods  (of averaging  the  payoffs  in a  series  of random  paths).  It presents  the  spe- 
cial  advantage  of allowing  the  use  of numerical  integration,  a method  which 
this  author  finds  extremely  flexible  to  program’  (owing  to  the  widely  avail- 
able  subroutines).  Numerical  integration  can  be  lengthier  in  computer  time 
but  saves  in  considerable  programming  labor  and  presents  a  smaller  error 
rate. 

The  operator  can  go  about  his  business,  provided  he  can  ascertain  that 

E, (S(t))  is risk  neutral. 

Ito’s  Lemma  for  Two  Assets 

It is easy  to  generalize  Ito’s  lemma  to  multiple  assets  (Table  G.1)

BLACK-SCHOLES  EQUATION 

The  Risk-Neutral  Argument 

First  it is necessary  to  get the  drift  out  of the  equation.  Say that  the  operator 
sold  a  European  call  C on  a  dividend  paying  asset  S and  bought  a  bond  B 
with  the  proceeds.*  The  bond  pays  r,  the  underlying  asset  is  r,  the  asset  is 
expected  to  return  yw  rate  of return.  The  call  is defined  as  the  Max(S-K,  0) 
and  expires  at period  t. 

Say  that  the  operator  would  remain  delta  neutral  at  all  times.  So  he 

would  have  on  his  balance  sheet  the  following  portfolio  P composed  of: 

hence 

Piet  Art  C/ O97 Og  A 

B= 

—GC/0515 

and  would  have  B equal  of the  difference  between  the  cash  raised  from  the 
call  and  the  dollars  invested  in  the  stock  S.  The  portfolio  earns  interest  at 
the  risk-free  rate  and  earns  dividends  on  the  stock  held.  Setting  AP  =  0 for 
the  portfolio  to  be  cash-flow  insensitive,  gives: 

NO  HOe/ Oo  NS  +  ABI  =  0 

so,  for  infinitesimally  small  increments  and  using  Ito’s  expansion: 

—  aC/at  dt  —  aC/aS  dS  —  % 8? C/aS*dS*  +  aC/aS  X  dS  +  dB  =0 

with 

dS  =  S(wdt  +  a dW) 

dS*  =  S? (uw dt  +  odZ)?  =  S*o7dt  from  the  Ito  multiplication  tables 

dB  =  rB,  the  interest  earned  on  the  bond  portfolio  (or paid,  if negative) 

AB  Stn  —10G/05  5 t=  0C  0a  a) ii=  mr  Eat  —  0C/es  S.(7  —  d) dt 

Thus: 

hence: 

~<8C/at  dt  —  %20°C/0S*  S207dt  +  r C dt  —  aC/0S  S (7, —  d) dt  =0 

aC/at  +  202C/0S?  S20?  — 

rC  +  0C/0S  S (r —  d) =  0 

(10)

One  can  see  dS  coming  out  of the  equation,  along  with  2.  The  only rates  left 
are  the  risk-free  and  the  payout  rate. 

From  here  on,  m  will  be called  the  risk-neutral  drift,  equivalent  to  r  —  d. 
The  operator  can  proceed  and  price  the  differential  equation  (10)  under 
boundary  conditions.  Or  he  could  integrate  the  diffusion  to  yield  the  same 
results  as  before  in  (7) but  with  (r —  d) in  place  of  pu: 

Ge  iexts  aa)  [max Cee  er

oo 

+  o\(t —  ty) x  —  K,) n(x)d(x) 

x  being  a  centered  Gaussian  random  variable.  The  solution  for  the  integral 
from  here  is  tedious  but  only  requires  slight  manipulations.  Users  end  up 
with  the  value  of the  call,  using  f, =  0 to  simplify  as: 

C=  exp(—  at) S.N@L)  —exp(  =  7  t)  K N(d2) 

with: 

d1  =  [log(S,/K)  +  (r —  d)t]/[oVt]  +  oWt/2 
d2  =  [log(S,/K)  +  (r —  d)tl/[oVi]  —  oVt/2 

A numeraire  change  will  easily  give the  put value.  The  put/call  parity  rules 
can  also  be  used  to  derive  it as  a  mirror  image  to  the  call. 

Following  are  the  formulas  and  techniques  used  in the book.  Most  of the 
thrust  was  on  numerical  methods  as  the  author—thanks  to  a  Pentium  chip 
received  as  a  birthday  gift—did  not  need  to  find  closed  form  solutions  to 
many  of the  exotic  options  and  the  stochastic  volatility  model. 

Most  of  the  numerical  methods  implemented  were  part  of  a Mathemat- 
ica™  Nintegrate  command  that  is based  on  the  Konrod  quadrature  method. 
One  integrates  between  —5  and 5 in lieu  of positive  or  negative  infinity  as  the 
error  beyond  becomes  very  small.  These  methods  are  outperforming  in cases 
where  early exercise  is excluded  and  mix  rather  well  with  options  priced  par- 
tially  analytically.  Being  still  a  trader,  the  author  did  not  have  to  subscribe  to 
academic  elegance  and  drew  on  the  comfort  of computer  power. 

STOCHASTIC  VOLATILITY  MODEL 

It  is  assumed  that  both  the  security  and  the  volatility  follow  a  Brownian 
motion.  This  is to  illustrate  the  effect  of heteroskedasticity  on  option  prices. 
The  process  is being  used  for  simple  purpose:  to gauge  the  value  of the  port- 
folio  at  expiration  assuming  the  operator  hedged  both  the  delta  and  the 
gamma  of the  options.  It is inspired  by stochastic  volatility  models,  such  as 

Option  Pricing 

465 

Hull  and  White?  (1987),  that  did  attempt  to  replicate  the  volatility  in a  risk- 
neutral  way  (through  the  buying  and  selling  of options),  akin  to  the  Black- 
Scholes  method  for the  asset  itself.  This  formula  assumes  that  there  exists  a 
risk-neutral  replication,  which  allows  for Feynman-Kac  final  payoff pricing. 
As  the  model  below  assumes  independence  between  asset  return  and 
volatility,  a numerical  “fudge”  is provided  that  considers  that  the  quadratic 
norm  of the  volatility  process

cesses  each  independent  and  normally  distributed  with  0  mean  and  unit 
variance. 

For  simplification,  assume  that  t, =  0.  The  no-free  lunch  rules  must  be 

satisfied:

Eop=  ic on(z’)dz’  =  6, 

n(z)  is the  normal  density  function  of z  with  mean  0 and  variance  1. 

Another  simplification  is to  make  the  expectation  uniform  with  time,  in 
order  not  to  include  a  term  structure  of volatility.  This  allows  the  use  of  a 
model  for  the  values  from  period t only. 

The  price  of the  European  option  follows: 

option(S,,  K, 0,7,  d, vvol) 

=  exp  (- 1) iS ie Max(®S,  —  ®K,  0)n(z)n(z)dzdz’ 

With  ®  =  1 when  the  option  is  a  call  and  ®  =  —1  when  the  option  is  a 
put.  The  double  integral  could  be  simplified  by integrating  a  Black-Scholes- 
Merton  call  over  different  o,.

r  is  the  risk-free  rate;  d, the  counterrate  for  asset  A  (foreign  rate  for  a  cur-

With  the  following  model,  traders  can  price  several  varieties  of multias- 

set  options  using  expectation  of final  payoff  thanks  to  Feynman-Kac.

®, equals  1 if the  mother  is a  put,  —1  if it is a  call. 
t, is the  time  to  expiration  of the  mother  option.

®, equals  1 if the  daughter  is a  put,  —1  if it is a  call. 

t, is the  time  to  expiration  of the  daughter  option. 

In addition  to  the  conventional  models,  the  following  will  be  included:

mother. 

These  rates  are  not  the  spot  rates  in  the  market  but  need  to  be  derived

BARRIER  OPTIONS 

There  are  two  ways  to  price  barrier  options.  The  first,  most  intuitive,  way,  is 
to  approach  it through  stopping  time  and  say  that  the  option  is the  Feynman- 
Kac  expectation  under  risk  neutral  probability  Q, times  the  risk  neutral  prob- 
ability  of  the  option  not  being  knocked-out  before  expiration  (which  is 
equivalent  to  the  probability  of stopping  time  being  longer  than  expiration). 
The  second,  more  convenient,  is to  use  the  reflection  principle  as  described  in 
Chapter  19, which  allows  for  simple  results  with  single  barriers. 

It is worthy  to  note  that  the  study  of the  joint  distribution  of the  triplet 
(upper  range,  lower  range,  Brownian  motion)  was  investigated  early  on  in 
probability  theory.  Its  premonition  was  attributed  to  a  later  (and  no  less 
precursor)  Bachelier  by Geman  and  Yor  (1996).  More  recent  results  for  op- 
tion  pricing  were  obtained  by Kunitomo  and  Ikeda  (1992). 

Thanks  to  the  reflection  principle  and  the  Girsanov  theorem,  one  can 
use  closed  form  solutions  for  barriers.  There  are  two  classes  of pricing  for- 
mulas  for  barriers: 

Option  Pricing

1.  Closed  form  Black-Scholes-Merton  based  formulas,  unfortunately 
weak  because  they  assume  constant  volatility  and  constant  interest 
rates  between  time  0 and  expiration,  a method  that  misprices  options 
when  there  is either  a  sloping  implied  volatility  or  interest  rate  curve. 

2.  Numerical  methods,  none  of  which  is  presently  in  the  public  do- 
main.  They  range  from  heavy-duty  Monte  Carlo  simulators  to  trees 
with  accurate  local  volatility  between  the  nodes. 

The  Reflection  Principle 

As  described  in  Chapter  19,  the  reflection  principle  allows  users  to  deter- 
mine  the  number  of conditional  Brownian  paths  between  two  points.  It will 
be  used  here  to  compute  the  risk-neutral  probability  density  of  the  paths 
that  reach  a  given  destination  without  going  through  the  barrier.  They will  be 
the  complement  (i.e.,  the  sum  equals  100%)  of: 

e¢  The  number  of paths  that  reach  a  destination  going  through  the  bar- 

rier  (the  difference  between  knock-in  and  knock-out). 

e  The  number  of paths  that  do not  reach  the  final  destination. 

Let  W, be  defined  as  a  standard  Brownian  motion  (0 drift)  and  /a  given 
limit  underneath  it.  The  reflection  principle  (see  Karatzas  and  Shreve,  1991; 
Grimmet  and  Stirzaker,  1992;  Lamberton  and  Lapeyre,  1991)  allows  the  fol- 
lowing  transformation: 

Ve  W, if the  barrier  is not  touched, 

and 

Ue,  =  2ieey  if the  barrier  is touched. 

Hence,  options  can  be priced  using  the  difference  between  the  two  processes 
as  described  in  Chapter  19.  However,  a  hitch  would  appear  if there  is a  drift, 
which  forces  us  to  use  the  Girsanov  theorem. 

Girsanov’s  Theorem 

What  Girsanov’s  theorem  allows  users  is to  create  a  new  fictitious  probabil- 
ity  density  to  replace  the  previous  one,  the  new  density  being  the  risk- 
neutral  one.t  Most  presentations  of  Girsanov  present  arduous  features 
whereas,  explained  to  traders,  it  appears  rather  simpler  to  digest  once 
stripped  of measure  theory.  A stripped-down  version  of the  theorem  is pre- 
sented  here  as  it becomes  a  lot  less  complicated  in  situations  where  the  drift 
is constant. 

470 

Modules 

The  principal  result  is  that  it  eliminates  the  drift  and,  instead, 
integrates  it  within  the  probability  distribution  by shifting  the  expecta- 
tion  accordingly. 

Define  W, as  a  standard  Brownian  motion  with  (0 drift  and  unit  vari- 

ance)  under  a  probability  measure  P. 

Girsanov’s  theorem  establishes  that  the  process  defined  by 

W’,= t+ W, 

a  standard  Brownian  motion  under  probability  measure  Q, with  Radon- 
Nikodym  derivative: 

dQ,/dP  =  exp  (12 \7t  —  XW’) 

A function  V of the  payoff  of  a Brownian  motion  (i.e.,  a derivative  secu- 
rity)  will  be  priced  so  its  expectation  under  probability  measure  Q is  the 
expectation  under  probability  measure  P  times  the  derivative  of  the  two 
measures: 

SO 

EV)  =  E’(dQ,/dP  V) 

E°(V)  =  EP(exp  (2N7t  —  XW“)  V) 

With  these  elements,  the  reader  can  build  the  pricing  intuition  for  bar- 

rier  options. 

Pricing  Barriers 

The  results  below  are  inspired  by Douady  (1996). 

The  trader  begins  with  the  call  up-and-out  and  builds  the  intuition  of 

the  pricing: 

e  Call  up-and-out  CUO  =  Under  probability  measure  P (risk-neutral), 
the  discounted,  by exp(—  rt), expectation  of the  Max  (S —  K, 0) as  be- 
fore  with  the  Black-Scholes-Merton  formula,  but  conditional  on  the 
barrier  H, not  being  touched. 

Therefore,  the  trader  should  start  with  S) <  H;  otherwise  the  option 
would  be  terminated  from  the  beginning.  Hence,  using  Girsanov,  the  process 
W’, =  I/o log(S,/S,)  is a Brownian  motion  without  drift  under  the probability: 

Q,=  exp( > =  Ww’ R 

with d =  (r —  d)/o  —  o  /2 

Option  Pricing

Hence, 

¢  CUO  =  Under  probability  measure  Q, exp(—  rt)  times  the  expecta- 
tion  of the  exp(—  '2\’t  —  \/olog(S,/S,))  times  (Max  (S —  K, 0), condi- 
tional  on  the  barrier  H not  being  touched. 

e  Using  the  reflection  principle,  the  density  of the  process  (under  Q) of 
S, is,  conditional  on  the  barrier  H,, not  being  touched,  equal  to  that 
of the  process  of H’/S.. 

This  allows  jumping  to: 

e  CUO  =  Expected  (discounted)  price  of  distribution  of  the  S, >K 

minus  the  expected  price  of the  paths  that  touch  the  barrier  H:

Stopping  Time  and  Its  Expectation. 
The  author  avoided  introducing  stop- 
ping time  in the  analysis  of barrier  options  in order  to build  on  the  intuitive 
approach  of the  reflection  principle.  Most  papers  introduce  it in the  deriva- 
tion  of  the  pricing  of any  barrier.  The  following  formula  is  the  calculation 
for  the  stopping  time  and  its  expectation. 

Take  as  before  \  =  (r —  d}/o  —o/2  and  the  barrier  h =  1/o  log  Hho, 
with  H  the  barrier.  The  density  of  the  unconditional  stopping  time  is  given 
with  no  drift: 

P(t)  =  (h/ V2a8) exp(—h?/2t) 

and,  adding  the  drift: 

P(t)  =  (h/ V2) exp(dh  —  X24/2  —  h2/2t) 

As  to  the  expectation  of  the  exit  time,  that  is  the  distribution  of  the  mini- 
mum  of 7  the  exit  time  and  the  time  to  expiration  T: 

E(17,,)  =h/d  +  (T —  h/d)  N(A/ VT —  XVT) 

—  exp(2Ah)(T  +  h/d)  N(—h/VT  —  XVT) 

With  a  double  barrier,  the  following  can  be computed. 

n=  t/o  log H/s, 

b=  T/olog  is,

INTRODUCTION 

1.  Leland  (1985)  provides  a  clear  review  of  the  literature  on  the  issue  of  discrete  time 
dynamic  hedging.  He  shows  that  the  replicating  portfolio  value,  composed  of long  the 
asset  and  short  the  option  will  not  be  0 at  all  times  once  we  start  hedging  infre- 
quently.  The  reader  will  see  in  the  Module  F that  the  Black-Scholes  price  is  derived 
from  a  strategy  that  would  make  the  P/L  stay  at  0 the  entire  time.  In  reality  it is not 
possible  to  buy  and  sell  continuously.  So  in  place  of  the  continuous  dt  we  opt  for  At, 
the  time  lapse  between  hedging  revisions.  The  P/L  will  be, however,  0 in  expectation. 
The  variance  of  the  package,  he  verified,  decreased  by V2  when  At  was  cut  by half. 
Similar  results  can  be  obtained  using  the  functional  central  limit  theorems  by show- 
ing  that  as  the  sample  paths  is  divided  in  infinitely  small  fragments  the  variance  of 
the  P/L  would  (uniformly,  no  less)  converge  to  0. 

_ 

One  alarming  fact  for  modern  financial  theory  is that  the  package  has  a  variance. 
It looks  just like  any  other  risky  security.  In  other  words:  option  replication  has  risks, 
which  requires  compensation.

CHAPTER  1.  INTRODUCTION  TO  THE  INSTRUMENTS 

Trading  them,  however,  can  be  done  in  such  a  way  as  to  cause  dependence  on  the  cor- 
relation  between  parts  and  make  them  akin  to  multiasset  options. 

The  bond  future  includes  a  hidden  option  (the  right  to  choose). 

Dixit  and  Pyndick  (1994)  study  the  application  of option  theory  to  corporate  financial 
management. 

Most  traders  think  in  terms  of the  forward  while  the  quants  think  in  terms  of the  cash 
since  the  Black-Scholes  (1973)  formula  views  an  option  price  as  a  function  of the  cash 
price  of  the  asset.  Merton’s  (1973)  approach  is  more  compatible  with  traders’  meth- 
ods.  This  distortion  can  lead  to  mishedging  in  cases  of currency  bands. 

American  options  complicate  the  solution  of the  Black-Scholes-Merton  partial  differ- 
ential  equation  under,  among  other  boundary  conditions,  the  early  exercise  rules  of 
Q(t),  an  optimal  exercise  path  where  the  derivative  security  is equal  to  6(S  —  K). Such 
time-dependent  boundary  condition  is causing  much  ink  to  flow.  Worse,  there  might 
be  two  boundaries  as  will  be  shown. 

More  complex  analysis  would  use  stochastic  interest  rates  and  take  into  account  the 
possibility  of  changes  in  the  structure  of  the  interest  rate  differential.  On  that,  see 
Amin  and  Jarrow  (1991)  for  a  treatment  of currency  option  pricing  with  stochastic  in- 
terest  rates. 

There  is, ironically,  a  flood  of academic  papers  attempting  to  value  American  options 
precisely  while  parameters  affecting  their  value  are  imprecise. 

A simple  application  of Ito’s  lemma  gives  these  results.

While  Eurodollars  are  quoted  in  100  —  yield  for  all  purpose  of analysis  (like  the  com- 
putation  of volatility  and  correlations),  we  use  the  derived  yield  as  the  variable. 

CHAPTER  2.  THE  GENERALIZED  OPTION 

In  Durett  (1991). 
J. Piper,  O’Connel,  and  Piper  seminar,  Chicago,  December  4,  1995.  It  is  remarkable 
that  some  veteran  equity  traders  fear  the  “bad  distribution”  to  the  point  of  refusing 
to  touch  a  put.  Such  phobias  are  part  of the  traders  survival  toolkit. 
More  advanced  analysis  would  show  that  it harbors  a  measure  of shadow  gamma  and 
shadow  delta,  characteristics  that  will  be  discussed  later  in  this  book. 

CHAPTER  3  MARKET  MAKING  AND  MARKET  USING 

This  case  is easily  replicated  in the  real  world  where  the  trader  buys  a  one-year  at-the- 
money  European  binary  option  for  $2.5  mil  paying  either  zero  or  $5 mil  at expiration  if 
the  SP500  closes  at  or  above  668.00. 

See  Grossman  and  Miller  (1988).

7.  A  clear  way  to  view  it  is  to  compare  the  P/L  of a  trader  to  a  Brownian  motion  with  a 

drift.  The  real  “skills”  of the  trader  would  correspond  to  the  drift. 

Let  P  be  the  profits  of  the  trader,  with  P, 

0,  4  a  Wiener  process  and  o  the 

volatility  of the  trader’s  P/L: 

dP  =  wdt  +  odZ 

an  arithmetic  Brownian  motion  (the  P  can  be  allowed  to  be  negative).  The  reader 
should  view  the  p  as  the  “edge”;  if he  believes  he  has  a  51%  against  49%  edge  on  the 
market  during  a  given  period  of time,  the  drift  is 2%  of the  net  amounts  involved.  The 
o  is  simply  the  volatility  of  the  market  in  which  the  trader  has  the  drift.  It becomes 
clear  that  the  volatility  of the  trader  will  dominate  the  drift  in  most  cases.  Counterin- 
tuitively,  the  o  will  typically  drown  the  p.

sent  a  high-right  moment,  a  skewness  with  a  small  sample  property  that  weakens  the 
power  of the  Sharpe  ratio.

CHAPTER  5  ARBITRAGE  AND  THE  ARBITRAGEURS 

These  are  applied  definitions  of arbitrage  largely  stripped  of the  dimension  in  micro- 
economics  and  financial  theory.  The  text  will  introduce  the  notion  of  self-financing 
strategies  in  connection  with  option  values. 

Oxford  English  Dictionary  (1971). 
If  there  is  a  multivariate  Ito  process  then  the  link  is  stochastic  (see  Module  G)  in 
terms  of Z, through  Z.. If both  securities  share  the  same  random  component,  then  the 
link  is deterministic. 
It is  uncertain  whether  one  can  use  risk  neutral  probabilities  when  pricing  the  value 
of a  passive  arbitrage. 

CHAPTER  6  VOLATILITY  AND  CORRELATION 

The  simplification  is  pedagogical  but  valid  at  the  limit  of very  small  increments.  The 
process  for  asset  prices  dS/S  =  w dt  +  o  dz  with  boundary  S(t,)  =  S, has  for  solution 
Ze hencesS  tS.  Fexpan((uem  Yo?) (t —  Eis 
log  .(5,/'5;)  =  (% —'ho?)(t  —  Eithio  IVE  sat 

o  Vt—t,Z))  with  S the  asset  price,  o  the  volatility,  t time,  and  Z  a  random  variable 
normally  distributed  with  unit  variance  and  zero  mean. 

Some  assets,  according  to  Raphael  Douady,  can  exhibit  overgeometric  behavior,  with 
their  volatility  increasing  in  higher  levels  and  decreasing  at  lower ones. 

See  Cox  and  Rubinstein  (1985). 

Some  traders  use  yp,  the  risk-neutral  drift  ina  SENS,  as  a  mean,  in  accordance 
with  the  Black-Scholes-Merton  prescription. 

See  Hamilton  (1994)  for  a  presentation  of state-space  models. 

See  Parkinson  (1980);  see  Atilgan  (1996).  Notice  that  Cox  and  Rubinstein  (1985)  calcu- 
lates  the  estimation  of volatility  based  on  the  average  S,,/S,,  which  biases  the  estima- 
tor  downward  by a factor  of 91%. 

Option  traders  call  gamma  trading  the  subsequent  delta  adjustments  emanating  from 
a  long  or  short  gamma  position. 

See  Taleb  (1996b). 

Lo  and  McKinley  (1988).

There  are  many  potent  methods,  such  as  the  Brock-Dechert-Scheinckman  BDS  test  of 
nonlinearity.  The  variance  ratio  is  satisfactory  enough  for  traders  and  risk  managers 
to  gain  a  knowledge  of the  structure  of the  volatility.  See  Brock,  Hsieh,  and  LeBaron 
(1991)  for  a  complete  analysis  of  nonlinear  dependence  (including  a  presentation  of 
the  correlation  integral). 

See  Kritzman  (1994). 
One  should  note  that  the  variance  ratio  is another  way  to  look  at autocorrelation.  It cor- 
responds  to  the  summation  of the  autocovariance  function  over  the  corresponding  lags. 
For  a  good  intuition,  see  Harvey  (1993)  and  the  excellent  book  by Bloomfield  (1976). 

CHAPTER  7  ADAPTING  BLACK-SCHOLES- 
MERTON:  THE  DELTA 

See  Black  (1988). 
If pair  (N, A) has  a  constant  volatility  (N is  a numeraire)  and  pair  (N, B) has  a  constant 
volatility,  and  pair  (B, A) has  a  constant  volatility,  then  the  correlation  between  (N, A) 

and  (N,  B) will  be  constant.  When  cross  options  trade  heteroskedasticity  means  un- 
stable  correlations. 

This  is  attributable  to  the  issue  of  discrete-time  convergence.  Options,  therefore,  con- 
verge  in value  to  Black-Scholes-Merton  but  not  in  the  higher  derivatives. 

Chapter  9 

483 

This  is  another  facet  of  the  discrete-time  convergence  problem.  A  binomial  leads  to  a 
continuous  time  valuation  of the  option.  But  the  delta  and  higher  Greeks  will  not  con- 
verge.  This  issue  is easier  to  see  with  a  portfolio  of options.

The  Taylor  expansion  thus  can  be  pushed  to  include,  in  addition  to  the  delta,  the 
gamma—the  DgammaDspot  (i.e.,  the  stability  of the  gamma)  in  the  measurement.  But 
for  a  portfolio  with  many  options,  the  expansion  needs  to  cover  higher  and  higher 
order  derivatives  to  track  the  risks.  It becomes  intuitive  that  the  VAR  does  not  apply 
to  a  book.  We  will  see  in  Chapter  11  why,  since  a  book  is  not  “compact”  and  since 
higher  orders  or  AU  do  not  vanish,  we  need  more  powerful  ways  to  look  at  the  risks. 

CHAPTER  8  GAMMA  AND  SHADOW  GAMMA 

I owe  the  coining  of the  term  “shadow  gamma”  to  one  of my  former  coworkers,  Lenny 
Dundennen. 

Sig(x)  is  the  change  in  volatility  resulting  from  the  changes  in  asset  price  between  x, 
) 
and  x. 

Shadow  gamma  should  not  be  confused  with  stochastic  volatility  techniques.  Implied 
volatility  here  is defined  to  be  a  direct,  deterministic  function  of the  move  as  predicted 
by the  trader  and  added  to  Black-Scholes-Merton.  Traders  can  thus  assert  that  volatil- 
ity would  be  higher  by 100  basis  points  should  the  market  drop  by 1%  and  establish  a 
map  of volatility  changes.  Another  way  to  view  the  difference  is  that  shadow  gamma 
is concerned  with  implied  volatility  (as  measured  by Black-Scholes-Merton),  whereas 
STOCHASTIC Volatility is concerned witha pricing model that tracks  more  accurately  the 
distribution  of the  actual  volatility(The  latter  assumes  that  volatility  is randomly  dis- 
around  some  mean,  similar  to  the  underlying  itself,  often  correlated  with 
tributed 
the  asset  price.

European  Rate  Mechanism. 

CHAPTER  9  VEGA  AND  THE  VOLATILITY  SURFACE 

It  is  assumed  that  one  Brownian  motion  affects  the  volatility  for  one  maturity  and 
that  the  rest  of them  follow  in  some  known  proportion. 

Taleb  (1996a). 

The  author’s  strong  reservations  about  the  value-at-risk  system  do  not  apply  to  the 
volatility  curve  for  the  following  reasons:  (1)  This  method  is  an  aid  in  short-term 
hedging  not  worst-case  scenario  analysis.  In  the  “tail”  events,  volatility  buckets  mat- 
ter  less  than  the  gamma  exposure  getting  there.  In  addition,  the  cross-vega  generally 
vanishes  in  the  tails;  (2) this  could  be  considered  a  second-degree  value-at-risk  method 
since  the  principal  instrument  is the  expectation  of the  second  moment. 

This  corresponds  to  the  floor  traders’  designation  of calendar  spreads  as  “horizontal” 
and  strike  spreads  as  “vertical,”  with  the  mixture  called  “diagonal.”

Notes 

The  local volatility  is  the  volatility  between  two  points  with  coordinates  (S,  t) and 

(S  + AS,  t +  At).  A  local  volatility  between  (S,  t) and  (S,  t +  At)  is  called  a  forward _ 

a  volatility,  as  discussed  earlier. 

a 

;  /  Dupire’s  (1996)  volatility  spot forward  is  expressed  as  V (20F/at)/(d?F 
x 

/dK*) with  K 
the  strike  price,  F the  derivative  security  value,  and  f¢ time  to  expiration.  The  second 
derivative  of  the  option  price  with  respect  to  the  strike  presents  what  Breeden  and 
Litzenberger  (1978)  deemed  to  be  the  local  risk-neutral  density  of  the  underlying 
asset. 

7.  Some  operators  build  the  volatility  surface  as  a  function  of the  delta  of the  option  in- 
stead  of the  spot/strike.  We  avoided  the  pitfall  of having  to  determine  the  delta  as  it is 
well  known  that  the  delta  is a  function  of volatility. 
8.  The  following  polynomial  function  was  estimated: 

x:  time  (days),  y =  In(fwd/K) 

Volatility  =  11.9257  +  0.110067  Sqrt[x]  +  5.77624  y  +  350.516  y —  / Sqrt[x] 
+  153.843  y? —  1088.23  y> —  1805.65  y* +  21942.8  y°

For  the  pair  numeraire-asset. 
It  is  always  preferable  to  derive  the  numerical,  not  the  anaMtical,  exposure  for  the 
rho.  The  analytical  exposure  would  sum  up  the  microscopic  derivatives  of  every  op- 
tion  multiplied  by the  size.  The  numerical  method  reprices  the  portfolio  and  can  thus 
deal  with  changing  derivatives. 

This  section  can  be  skipped  at  first  reading. 

It  can  be  computed  using  the  classical  Black-Scholes-Merton  differential  equation 
(eliminating  the  drift): 

Kor bridge  the  alpha  with  fair  value,  the  trader  can  consider  that  the  expected  theta 
given  a  volatility  would  be  negative  where  one  “pays  up”  for  the  alpha.  Expected 
theta  for  a  Black-Scholes-Merton  hedger  is  the  net  of  time  decay  after  hedging  in  a 
market  of  a.  given  volatility.  Using  0 as  time  decay,  I the  gamma,  a  as  the  alpha,  o  as 
implied  volatility,  and  o’  as  actual  over  the  period,  we  get  the  expected  theta: 

E(8)  =  a(a)  I'(a)  —  a(o')P(a’) 

We  see  that  expected  time  decay  is positive  if o’  >  o  and  negative  if o’  <o. 

6.  This  section  was  added  because  it came  to  the  author’s  attention  that  traders  tend  to 

use  these  measurements,  not  because  of their  risk  management  value. 

7.  Mathematical  Note.  The  percentage  difference  is  inaccurate  for  large  moves  because  of 
the  asymmetry  in  lognormal  markets.  It  is  more  mathematically  correct  to  use  Log 
(spot/barrier).  The  difference  becomes  larger  when  the  barrier  is  away  from  the 
money. 

8.  Gamma  is  a  special  case  of  convexity  (i.e.,  convexity  with  respect  to  the  asset  price). 

However,  its  precision  required  presentation  in  a  separate  section. 

9.  Using  the  best  fit  method  given  the  limited  number  of points,  the  author  found: 

Factor  =  1.30825  —  .03789  x  +  .0007419  x?, with  x  the  maturity  (in years). 

10. 

The  mathematical  way  to  price  such  a  convexity  is through  Ito’s  change  of variable  as 
described  in  Module  G.  There  is  an  Ito  term  in  the  payoff  of the  Eurodollar.  The  Eu- 
rodollar  futures  could  be  interpreted  as  a  function  of a  random  variable  with  a  payoff 
equal  to  dr  X  exp  {r(t  —  to)}  with  the  random  variable  r  following  a  Brownian  motion.

trader  who  has  a  bad  run  knows  he  has  hit  the  absorbing  state  when  clearing  firm 
representatives  show  up  in  the  middle  of  the  pit to  take  away  his  trading  privileges 
(sometimes  they  require  the  help  of security  guards  to  draw  the  hapless  trader  out  of 
the  pit). 

3.  Mathematical  Note.  If we  bound  a  random  walk  to  W, <  W,,,,.  It becomes  clear  that  as 
W, becomes  close  to  W,,,,,  volatility  needs  to  drop  for  the  market  to  remain  in  a  “fair” 
game.  Another  solution  is for  the  market  to  have  excessive  skew.

times  the  square  of the  second  moment.

2.  The  matching  cannot  be  perfect.  It is necessary,  therefore,  to  establish  a  cost  function 
(typically  the  quadratic  norm  of  the  difference)  and  minimize  it.  In  addition,  some 
weights  can  be  introduced  to  reflect  the  importance  of the  parameter  risk. 

3. 

To  use  market  maker  jargon,  “below  sheets.”  “Sheets”  are  spreadsheets  with  theoret- 
ical  value  that  market  makers  carry  on  the  exchanges.  Below  sheets  means  below  the- 
oretical  value  (assuming  no  shift  in  parameters). 

4.  This  is analogous  in  probability  theory  to  the  Brownian  bridge  where  possible  paths 

are  examined  conditional  on a final  arrival  point. 

5.  Assume,  for  simplicity,  that  the  forward  trades  at  flat  with  the  spot  and  that  the 

owner  of an  option  incurs  negligible  carrying  costs. 

CHAPTER  17.  BINARY  OPTIONS:  EUROPEAN  STYLE

CHAPTER  18  BINARY  OPTIONS:  AMERICAN  STYLE 

Howard  Savery’s  rule  of thumb  is that  the  American  digital  will  be  roughly  twice  the 
European.  The  reason  is  that  in  at  the  money  American  will  be  worth  $1  (it  termi- 
nates)  while  an  European  is worth  $.50.  This  relationship  will  “contaminate”  to  lower 
prices. 

CHAPTER  19  BARRIER  OPTIONS  (I) 

The  reader  should  be  acquainted  with  liquidity  holes  (Chapter  4) before  proceeding. 

Advanced  Topic.  (It is recommended  that  the  reader  practice  the  skew  decomposition 
method  of the  binary  option  prior  to  further  reading  of this  section.) 

See  Grimmet  and  Stirzaker  (1992);  Karatzas  and  Shreve  (1991). 

The  stickler  can  use  an  up  node  of exp  {(a  —  '20)t}  and  a  down  node  of exp  {(—  at)}  sat- 
isfying  both  risk  neutrality  and  lognormality.  Again  there  is  no  point  complicating 
such  exercise  with  true  lognormal  moves.  Alan  Brace  told  the  author:  “communication 
is  more  important  than  accuracy.” 

See  Dupire  (1992,  1993,  1994,  1996),  Rubinstein  (1994),  and  Derman  and  Kani  (1994). 

CHAPTER  20  BARRIER  OPTIONS  (II) 

A thorough  understanding  of American  binary  options  is necessary  before  proceeding. 

CHAPTER  22  MULTIASSET  OPTIONS 

The  matrix  needs  to  be  symmetric  and  positive  definite. 

Lee  Stulz  (1982). 

be Sa We 

See  Margrabe  (1978). 
Mathematical  Note.  Since  the  exercise  aims  at  finding  sensitivity,  not  prices,  it is possi- 
ble  to  set  aside  the  lognormality  issue.  The  correlation  vega  does  not  vary  markedly 
after  an  adjustment  in  the  stochastic  process.  Only  the  odd  moments  (the  ones  linked 
to  the  skew)  will  be  truly  affected. 

See  Taleb  (1997). 
The  devaluation  risk  is excluded  in  pricing;  therefore  the  operator  would  focus  on  the 
option  without  the  component.

CHAPTER  23.  MINOR  Exotics:  LOOKBACK  AND 
ASIAN  OPTIONS 

See  Goldman,  Sosin,  and  Gatto  (1979). 
Given  the  fluidity  of market  designations,  the  term  Asian  may  bear  some  other  mean- 
ing in  some  circles. 
For  an  interesting  approach  to  the  problem,  see  Geman  and  Yor  (1993)  where  the  aver- 
age  of a  geometric  Brownian  is decomposed  in  a  series  of subordinated  Bessel  processes.

Such  a  method  allows  the  pricing  of puts  as  calls  with  the  numeraire  flipped. 

This  section  can  be  omitted  without  any  loss  of the  substance  of the  paradox. 

For  a  definition  of a  convex  function,  see  Chapter  1.

Changes  of  numeraire  are  used  with  term  structure  models  as  “glue”  where  every

MoputLeE  E-  THE  VALUE-AT-RISK 

A  trader  translation:  “when  it goes  it keeps  going.” 

See  Markowitz  (1959)  for  the  breakthrough  in  minimum  variance  portfolio  selec- 
tion  and  the  birth  of  modern  portfolio  theory.  See  Ingersoll  (1986),  Huang  and

Litzenberger  (1988),  or  the  more  accessible  Elton  and  Gruber  (1995)  for  a  descrip- 
tion  of the  notion  of mean  variance. 

Similar  to  the  VAR  is an  excellent  technique  called  “generalized  pairs  trading,”  a  short 
term  trading  method  where,  conditional  upon  the  return  vector  IM  ee lay  bomen  aly Co 
time  t of securities  a  vector  X, =  {X,,  X,,...,  X,} of security  prices  where  a  multivari- 
ate  diffusion  is  assumed,  one  can  find  a  linear  combination  a  =  [Ol Op 
mizing  the  conditional  probability  of  making  a  profit  on  a  portfolio  a!  (X,  —  X,.,,) 
where  a’  is  the  transpose  a,  if  the  market  diffused  properly  between  (f —  At) 
and  (f +  At).  In  other  words,  the  trader  can  thus  detect  which  securities  at  times  t 
behaved  as  an  outlier  with  respect  to  the  covariance  matrix  between  securities  as 
know  at  period  t —  At  and  take  action,  hoping  that  this  would  correct  by next  period 
t +  At.  If two  assets  assumed  to  behave  alike  (that  is  highly  correlated)  parted  way, 
there  might  be  a  trade  (assuming  no  new  information)  with  the  certainty  of a  profit 
potential  higher  than  97%.  The  trader  can  buy one  and  sell  the  other  if he  attributes 
the  statistical  divergence  to  some  liquidity  factor.  Unlike  the  VAR,  such  technique, 
handled  by the  professional,  is impervious  to  a  large  amount  of tail  events  as  it fore- 
casts  the  “body”  of  the  distribution,  not  the  rare  occurrences.

More  formally,  W  is  a  Wiener  process.  Uncertainty  about  the  process  is  represented 
by a filtered  probability  space  “quadruple,”  {Q,  P,  F,  F,}  where  ©  is  the  probability 
space,  P the  objective  probability  measure,  F a  o-algebra  (or,  in  this  instance,  a  Borel

Cox,  J., &  Rubinstein,  M.!  (1985).  Option  Markets,  Englewood  Cliffs,  NJ:  Prentice  Hall. 

The  best  book  ever  written  on  options;  after  more  than  a  decade  the  book  has  not  a 
speck  of dust.  It is written  with  rare  intuitive  depth  of market  sense.  Imperative  read- 
ing  for  anyone  who  enters  a  trading  room. 

Natenberg,  S.  (1995).  Option  Volatility  and  Pricing  Strategies  (2nd  ed.),  Chicago:  Probus. 

Unencumbered  with  theory,  it  portrays  option  trading  from  the  vantage  point  of  a 
down-to-earth  floor  trader.  It provides  an  essential  introductory  text  for book  runners 
and  risk  managers. 

Baird,  A.  (1994).  Option  Market  Making,  New  York:  Wiley. 

More  advanced  than  Natenberg,  a  compact  reading  for  a  market  maker.  The  reader 
will  find  in  it some  introductory  preparation  for  the  concepts  of  risk  management  of 
an  inventory.

(continued  from  front  flap) 

Dynamic  Hedging  is  replete  with  helpful 
tools,  market  anecdotes,  at-a-glance  risk 
management  rules  distilling  years  of 
market  lore,  and  important  definitions. 
The  book  contains  modules  in which  the 
fundamental  mathematics  of  derivatives, 
such  as  the  Brownian  motion,  Ito’s  lemma, 
the  numeraire  paradox,  the  Girsanov 
change  of measure,  and  the  Feynman-Kac 
solution  are  presented  in  intuitive  practi- 
tloner’s  language. 

Dynamic  Hedging  is  an  indispensable 
and  definitive  reference  for  market  mak- 
ers,  academics,  finance  students,  risk 
managers,  and  regulators. 

NASSIM  TALEB,  an  option  arbitrage  pio-

Mr.  Taleb  has  consulted  on  complex 
derivatives  risk  to  the  world’s  leading

of  Paris.  He  also  holds  an  MBA  in 
finance  from  the  Wharton  School.  Taleb 
is currently  principal  of Taleb  Research,

“Dynamic  Hedging  bridges  the  gap  between  what  the  best  traders  know

“The  most  comprehensive,  insightful,  intuitive  work  on  the subject.  It 1s

“A tour  de  force.  That  rare  find,  a  book  of great  practical  and  theoreti- 
cal  value.  Taleb  successfully  bridges  the  gap  between  the  academic  and 
the  real  world.  Interesting,  provocative,  well  written.  Each  chapter  worth 
a fortune  to any  current  or  prospective  derivatives  trader.”
