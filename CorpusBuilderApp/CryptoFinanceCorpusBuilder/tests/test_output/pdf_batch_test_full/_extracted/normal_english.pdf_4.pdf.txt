FOREWORD 
The great bull market in stocks has led to an equally great bull market in the number of books 
published on the subject of how to make m oney trading the markets. Many ideas abound, some go od, 
some not, some origin al, some just a repackagi ng of earlier work s. Occasionally, tho ugh, a writer 
comes forward with something that really sets him or her apart from the pack, someth ing special. One 
such writer is Mark Douglas. Mark Douglas, in Trad ing in the Zone, has written a book that is the 
accumulation of y ears of t hought and res earch—the work of a life time— and for th ose of us w ho view 
trading as a professio n, he has pr oduced a gem. 
Trading  in the Zone is an in-depth look at t he challenges that we face when we take up t he challenge of 
trading. To the novice, the only challen ge appears  to be to find a way to ma ke money. On ce the n ovice 
learns that tips, brokers' a dvice, a nd other ways to justify buying or selling do not wo rk consistently, he 
discovers th at he either needs to d evelop a reliable trading strategy or purchase one. After that, trading 
should be easy , right? All you have to do is follow the rules, and the money will fall into your lap. 
At this point, if not before, novices discover that trading can tu rn into one of the most frustrati ng 
experiences they will ever face. 
This experience leads to the oft-started statistic that 95 percent of futures traders lose all of their mo ney 
within t he first year of tr ading. Stock traders generally experience the same results, which is why 
pundits alwa ys point to the fact that most stock traders fail to outperform a simp le buy and h old 
invest ment scen ario.  
So, why do peopl e, the majority of whom are extremely succe ssful in oth er occupation s, fail so 
miserably as trad ers? Are successf ul trad ers born and not made? Mark Do uglas says no. What's 
necessary, he says, is that the i ndividual acquire the trader's mi ndset. It sounds easy, but the fact is, this 
mindset is very forei gn when comp ared w ith the way our life experiences te ach us to think about the 
world. 
That 95-percent fa ilure rate ma kes sense when you c onsider how mo st of us experience life, using 
skills learned as we gr ow. When it comes to trading, howeve r, it turns out that the skills we l earn to 
earn high marks in school, advance our careers, and create relationships with other people, the skills we 
are taught that sh ould ca rry us t hrough life, turn out to be inappropriate for trading. Trad ers, we find 
out, must learn to think in terms of pr obabilities a nd to surre nder all of the sk ills we ha ve ac quired to 
achieve in virtually every other aspect of our lives. In Trading in the Zone, Mark Douglas teaches us 
how. He has put together a v ery valuab le book. His s ources are his own p ersonal experiences as a 
trader, a traders coach in Chicago, author, and lecturer in his field of trading psycholo gy. 
My recommendation?  First see how a trading community  looks like and then Enjoy Douglas's Trading 
in the Zone and, in doing so, develop a trader's mindset  
 
 
 
PREFACE 
 
 
The goal of any trader is to turn profits on a regular basis, yet so few people ever really make consistent 
money as traders. What accounts for the small percentage of traders who are consistently successful? 
To me, the determining factor is psychological—the consistent winners think differently from everyone 
else.I started trading in 1978. At the time, I was managing a commercial casualty insuran ce agency in 
the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan. I had a very successful career and thought I could easily transfer that 
success into trading. Unfortunately, I found that was not the case.  
By 1981, I was thoroughly disgusted with my inability to trade effectively while hol ding another job, 
so I moved to Chicago and got a job as a broker with Merrill Lynch at the Chicago Board of Trade. 
How did I do? Well, within nine months of moving to Chicago, I had lost nearly everything I o wned. 
My losses were the result of both my trading activ ities and my exorbitant life style, which demanded 
that I make a lot of money as a trader. From these early experiences as a trader, I learned an  enormous 
amount about myself, and about the role of psycholo gy in trading. As a result, in 1982, I started 
working on my first book, The Disciplined Trader: Developing Winning Attitudes.  
When I began this project I had no concept of how di fficult it was to write a book or explain something 
that I understood for myself in a manner and form th at would be useful to other people. I thought it was 
going to take me between six and nine months to get the job done. It took seven and a half years a nd 
was finally published by Prentice Hall in 1990. In 1983, I left Merrill Lynch to start a consulting firm, 
Trading Behavior Dynamics, where I presently develop and conduct seminars on trading psychology 
and act in the capacity of what is commonly refe rred to as a trading co ach. I've done countless 
presentations for trading companies, clearing firms, brokerage houses, banks,  and investment 
conferences all over the world.  
I've worked at a personal level, one on one, with virtually every type of trader in th e business, including 
some of the biggest floor traders, hedgers, option sp ecialists, and CTAs, as well as neophytes As of this 
writing, I have spent the last seventeen years dissec ting the psychological dynamics behind trading so 
that I could develop effective methods for teaching the proper principles of success. 
What I've discovered is that, at the most fundamenta l level, there is a problem with the way we think. 
There is something inherent in the way our mind s work that doesn't fit very well with the 
characteristics shown by the markets. Those traders who have confidence in their own trades , who trust 
themselves to do what needs to be done without hesitation, are the ones who become successful. They 
no longer fear the erratic behavior of the market. Th ey learn to focus on the in formation that helps them 
spot opportunities to make a profit, rather than focusing on the inform ation that reinforces their fears. 
While this may sound complicated, it all boils down to  learning to believe that: (1) you don't need to 
know what's going to happen next to make money; (2) anything can happen; and (3) eve ry moment is 
unique, meaning every edge and outcome is truly a unique experience. The trade either works or it 
doesn't. In any case, you wait for the next edge to appear and go through the process again a nd again. 
With this approach you will learn in a methodical, non-random fashion what works and what doesn't. 
And, just as important, you will build a sense of self-trust so that you won't damage yourself in an 
environment that has the unlimit ed qualities the markets have. 
Most traders don't believe that their trading problems are the result of the way they  think about trading 
or, more specifically, how they  are thinking while they are trading. In my first book, The Disciplined 
Trader, I identified the problems confronting the trader from a mental perspective and then built a  
philosophical framework for understanding the nature of these problems and why they exist.  
I had five major objectives in mind in writing Trading in the Zone: 
 
To prove to the trader that more or better market analysis is not the solution to his trading difficult ies or 
lack of consistent results. 
 
To convince the trader that it's his attitude an d "state of mind" that determine his results. 
 
To provide the trader with the sp ecific beliefs and attitudes that are necessary to build a winner's 
mindset, which means learning how to think in probabilities. 
 
To address the many conflicts, contradictions, and paradoxes in thinking that cau se the typical trader to 
assume that he already does think in probabilities, when he really doesn't. 
 
To take the trader through a process that integrates this thinking strategy into his mental system at a 
functional level. 
 
(Note: Until recently, most traders were men, but I re cognize that more and more women are joining 
the ranks. In an effort to avoid confusion and awkward phrasing, I have consistently used the pro noun 
"he" throughout this book in describing traders. This  certainly does not reflect any bias on my part.) 
 
Trading in the Zone presents a serious psychological approach to becoming a consistent winner in your 
trading. I do not offer a trading system; I am more interested in showing you how to think in the  way 
necessary to become a profitable trader. I assume that you already have your own system, your own 
edge. You must learn to trust your edge. The edge means there is a higher probability of one outcome 
than another. The greater your confidence, the easier it will be to execute your trades. This book  is 
designed to give you the insight and understanding you need about yourself and the nat ure of trading, 
so that actually doing it becomes as easy, simple, and stressfree as when you're just watching the 
market and thinking about doing it. 
In order to determine how well you "think like a tr ader," take the following Attitude Survey. There are 
no right or wrong answers.  
Your answers are an indication of how consistent your current mental framework is with the way you 
need to think in order to get the most out of your trading.

CHAPTER 1  
 
THE ROAD TO SUCCESS: 
FUNDAMENTAL, TECHNICAL, 
OR MENTAL ANALYSIS? 
 
IN THE BEGINNING: FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS 
 
Who remembers when fundamental analysis was considered the only real or proper way to make 
trading decisions? When I started trading in 1978, technical analysis was used by only a handful of 
traders, who were considered by the rest of the market community to be, at the very least, crazy. As 
difficult as it is to believe now, it wasn't very long ago when Wall Street and most of the major funds 
and financial institutions thought that technical an alysis was some form of mystical hocus-pocus. 
Now, of course, just the opposite is true. Almost all experienced traders use some f orm of technical 
analysis to help them formulate their trading strate gies. Except for some small, isolated pockets in the 
academic community, the "purely" fundamental analyst is virtually extinct. What caused this dramatic 
shift in perspective? I'm sure it's no surprise to any one that the answer to this  question is very simple: 
Money! The problem with making trading decision s from a strictly fundamental perspective is the 
inherent difficulty of making money consistently using this approach. 
For those of you who may not be familiar with fundamental analysis, let me explain. Fundam ental 
analysis attempts to take into consideration all the variables that could affect the rela tive balance or 
imbalance between the supply of and the possible demand for any particular stock, commodi ty, or 
financial instrument. Using primarily mathematical models that weigh the significance of a variety of 
factors (interest rates, balance sheets, weather patterns, and numerous others), the ana lyst projects what 
the price should be at some point in the future. 
The problem with these models is that they rarely, if ever, factor in other traders as variables. People, 
expressing their beliefs and expectations about the fu ture, make prices move—not models. The fact that 
a model makes a logical and reasonable projection based on all the relevant variables is not of much 
value if the traders who are responsible for most of the trading volume are not aware of the model or  
don't believe in it. 
As a matter of fact, many traders, especially those on the floors of the futures exchanges who have the 
ability to move prices very dramatic ally in one direction or the other,  usually don't ha ve the slightest 
concept of the fundamental supply and demand factors that are supposed to affect prices. F urthermore, 
at any given moment, much of their trading activity is prompted by a response to emotiona l factors that 
are completely outside the parameters of the fundam ental model. In other words, the people who trade 
(and consequently move prices) don't always act in a rational manner. 
Ultimately, the fundamental analyst could find that a prediction about where prices should  be at some 
point in the future is correct. But in the meantime, pr ice movement could be so volatile that it would be 
very difficult, if not impossible, to stay in a trade in order to realize the objective. 
 
THE SHIFT TO TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 
 
Technical analysis has been around for as long as there have been organized markets in the form of 
exchanges. But the trading community didn't accept technical analysis as a viable tool for maki ng 
money until the late 1970s or early 1980s. Here's wh at the technical analyst knew that it took the 
mainstream market community generations to catch on to. 
A finite number of traders participate in the markets on any given day, week, or month. Many of th ese 
traders do the same lands of things over and over in their attempt to make money. In other words, 
individuals develop behavior patterns, and a group of individuals, interacting with on e another on a 
consistent basis, form collective behavior patterns. These behavior patterns are observab le and 
quantifiable, and they repeat themselves with statistic al reliability. Technical analysis is a method that 
organizes this collective behavior into identifiable patterns that can give a clear indicatio n of when 
there is a greater probability of one thing happening over another. In a sense, technical analysis a llows 
you to get into the mind of the market to anticipate what's likely to happen next, based on t he kind of 
patterns the market generated at some previous moment.  
As a method for projecting future price movement, technical analysis has turned out to be f ar superior 
to a purely fundamental approach. It keeps the trader focused on what the market is doing now in 
relation to what it has done in the past, instead of focusing on what the market sh ould be doing based 
solely on what is logical and reasonable as determ ined by a mathematical model. On the other hand, 
fundamental analysis creates what I call a "reality gap" between "w hat should be" and "what is." The 
reality gap makes it extremely difficult to make anything but very long-term predictions that can be 
difficult to exploit, even if they are correct. 
In contrast, technical analysis not only closes this reality gap, but also makes available to  the trader a 
virtually unlimited number of possibilities to take advantage of. The technical approach opens u p many 
more possibilities because it identifies how the same repeatable behavior patterns occur in every time 
frame—moment-tomoment, daily, weekly, yearly, and every time span in between. In other w ords, 
technical analysis turns the market into an endless stream of opportunities to enrich oneself. 
 
THE SHIFT TO MENTAL ANALYSIS 
 
If technical analysis works so well, why would more and more of the trading community s hift their 
focus from technical analysis of the market to mental analysis of themselves, meaning the ir own 
individual trading psychology? To answer this question, you probably don't have to do anything m ore 
than ask yourself why you bought this  book. The most likely reason is that you're dissatisfied with the 
difference between what you perceive as the unlimited potential to make money and w hat you end up 
with on the bottom line. That's the problem with technical analysis, if you want to call it a problem. 
Once you learn to identify patterns and read the market, you find there are limitless opportunities t o 
make money. But, as I'm sure you already know, there can also be a huge gap between what you 
understand about the markets, and your ability to tran sform that knowledge into consistent profits or a 
steadily rising equity curve. 
Think about the number of times you've looked at a price chart and said to you rself, "Hmmm, it looks 
like the market is going up (or down, as the case may be)," and what you thought was going to happen 
actually happened. But you did nothing except watch the market move while you anguishe d over all the 
money you could have made. 
There's a big difference between predicting that something will happen in the market (and thinking 
about all the money you could have made) and the reality of actually getting into and out of trades. I 
call this difference, and others like it, a "psychological gap" that can make trading one of the m ost 
difficult endeavors you could choose to undertake and certainly one of the most mysterious to master. 
The big question is: Can trading be mastered? Is it possible to experience trading with th e same ease 
and simplicity implied when you are only watching the market and thinking about success, as oppose d 
to actually having to put on and ta ke off trades? Not only is the answer an unequivocal "yes," but that's 
also exactly what this book is designed to give you—the insight and understanding you need about 
yourself and about the nature of trading. So the result  is that actually doing it becomes as easy, simple, 
and stress-free as when you are just watching the market and thinking about doing it. 
This may seem like a tall order, and to some of you it may even seem impossible. But it's not. There are 
people who have mastered the art of trading, who have closed the gap between the possibilities 
available and their bottom-line performance. But as you might expect, these winners are relatively few 
in number compared with the number of traders who experience varying degree s of frustration, all the 
way to extreme exasperation, wondering why they can't create the consistent success they so 
desperately desire. 
In fact, the differences between these two groups of traders (the consistent winners and ev eryone else) 
are analogous to the differences between the Eart h and the moon. The Earth and moon are both 
celestial bodies that exist in the same solar system, so they do have something in common. But they are 
as different in nature and characteristics as night and day. By the same token, anyon e who puts on a 
trade can claim to be a trader, but when you compare the characteristics of the handful of co nsistent 
winners with the characteristics of most other traders, you'll find they're also as different a s night and 
day. 
If going to the moon represents c onsistent success as a trader, we ca n say that getting to the moon is 
possible. The journey is extremely difficult and only a handful of people have made it. From our 
perspective here on Earth, the moon is usually visible every night and it seems so close that we c ould 
just reach out and touch it.  
Trading successfully feels the same way. On any given day, week, or month, the markets make 
available vast amounts of money to anyone who has the capacity to put on a trade. Since  the markets 
are in constant motion, this money is also constantly flowing, which makes the poss ibilities for success 
greatly magnified and seemingly within your grasp. I use the word "seemingly" to make an important 
distinction between the two groups of traders. For those who have learned how to be consistent, or have  
broken through what I call the "threshold of consistency,"the money is not o nly within their grasp; they 
can virtually take it at will. I'm sure that some will find this statement shocking or difficult to be lieve, 
but it is true. There are some limitations, but for th e most part, money flows into the accounts of these 
traders with such ease and effortlessness that it literally boggles most people's minds. 
However, for the traders who have not evolved into this select group, the word  "seemingly" means 
exactly what it implies. It seems as if the consistenc y or ultimate success they desire is "at hand," or 
"within their grasp," just before it slips away or evaporates before their eyes, time and time again. The 
only thing about trading that is consistent with this group is emotional pain. Yes, they certainly have 
moments of elation, but it is not an exaggeration to say that most of the time they are in a stat e of fear, 
anger, frustration, anxiety, disappointment, betrayal, and regret. So what  separates these two groups of 
traders? Is it intelligence? Are the consistent winn ers just plain smarter than everyone else? Do they 
work harder? Are they better analysts, or do they have access to better trading systems? Do they  
possess inherent personality characteristics that make it easier for them to deal with the intense 
pressures of trading? 
All of these possibilities sound quite plausible, except when you consider that most of the tr ading 
industry's failures are also some of society's brightest and most accomplished people. The largest group 
of consistent losers is composed primarily of doc tors, lawyers, engineers, scientists, CEOs, wealthy 
retirees, and entrepreneurs.  
Furthermore, most of the industry's best market analysts are the worst traders imaginable. Intellige nce 
and good market analysis can The Road to Success certa inly contribute to success, but they are not the 
defining factors that separa te the consistent winners from everyone el se. Well, if it isn't intelligence or 
better analysis, then what could it be? 
Having worked with some of the best and some of the worst traders in the business, and having helped 
some of the worst become some of the best, I can state without a doubt that there are specific reasons 
why the best traders consistently out-perform everyone else. 
If I had to distill all of the reasons down to on e, I would simply say that the best traders think 
differently from the rest. I know that doesn't s ound very profound, but it does have profound 
implications if you consider what it means to think differently. 
To one degree or another, all of us think differently from everyone else. We may not always be mindful 
of this fact; it seems natural to assume that othe r people share our perceptions and interpretations of 
events. In fact, this assumption continues to seem valid until we find ourselves in a basic, fu ndamental 
disagreement with someone about something we both experienced. Other than our physical features, 
the way we think is what makes us unique, probably even more unique than our physical features do. 
Let's get back to traders. What is different about die way the best traders think as opposed to how those 
who are still struggling think? While the markets can be described as an arena of endless opportunities, 
they simultaneously confront the individual with some of the most sustained, adverse psychological 
conditions you can expose yourself to. At some point, everyone who trades learns something about the 
markets that will indicate when opportunities exist. But learning how to identify an opportunity to buy 
or sell does not mean that you ha ve learned to think like a trader. 
The defining characteristic that separates the consistent winners from everyone else is this: The winners 
have attained a mind-set—aunique set of attitudes—that allows them to remain discip lined, focused, 
and, above all, confident in spite of the adverse conditions. As a result, they are no longer susceptible to 
the common fears and  trading errors that plague everyone else. Everyone who trades ends up learning 
something about the markets; very few people who tr ade ever learn the attitudes that are absolutely 
essential to becoming a consistent winner. Just as people can learn to perfect the proper technique for 
swinging a golf club or tennis racket, their consistency, or lack of it, will without a doubt come from  
their attitude Traders who make it beyond "the threshold of consistency" usually experience a great 
deal of pain (both emotional and financial) before th ey acquire the land of attitude that allows them to 
function effectively in the market environment. Th e rare exceptions are usually those who were born 
into successful trading families or who started their trading careers under the guidance of someone who 
understood the true nature of trading, and, just as important, knew how to teach it . 
Why are emotional pain and financial disaster common among traders? The simple answer  is that most 
of us weren't fortunate enough to start our trading careers with the proper guidance. 
However, the reasons go much deeper than this. I have spent the last seventeen years dissecting the 
psychological dynamics behind trading so that I could develop effective methods for teaching the 
principles of success. What I've discovered is that trading is chock full of paradoxes an d contradictions 
in thinking that make it extremely difficult to learn how to be successful. In fact, if I had to choose one 
word that encapsulates the nature of trading, it would be "paradox." 
(According to the dictionary, a paradox is something that seems to have contradictory qualities or that 
is contrary to common belief or what generally makes sense to people.) 
Financial and emotional disaster are common among traders because many of the perspectives, 
attitudes, and principles that would otherwise make pe rfect sense and work quite well in our daily lives 
have the opposite effect in the trading environment. They just don't work. Not knowing this, most 
traders start their careers with a fundamental lack of understanding of what it means to be a trade r, the 
skills that are involved, and the depth to which those skills need to be developed. 
Here is a prime example of what I am talking about: Trading is inherently risky. To my knowledge, no 
trade has a guaranteed outcome; therefore, the poss ibility of being wrong and losing money is always 
present. So when you put on a trade, can you consider yourself a risk-taker? Even though  this may 
sound like a trick question, it is not. 
The logical answer to the question is, unequivocally, yes. If I engage in an activity that is inhere ntly 
risky, then I must be a risktaker. This is a perfec tly reasonable assumption fo r any trader to make. In 
fact, not only do virtually all traders make this assumption, but most traders take p ride in thinking of 
themselves as risk-takers. The problem is that this  assumption couldn't be further from the truth. Of 
course, any trader is taking a risk when you put on a trade, but that doesn't me an that you are 
correspondingly accepting that risk. In other words,  all trades are risky because the outcomes are 
probable—not guaranteed. But do most traders really believe they are taking a risk when  they put on a 
trade? Have they really accepted that the trade has a non-guaranteed, probable outcome? Furthermore, 
have they fully accepted the possible consequences?  
The answer is, unequivocally, no! Most traders have absolutely no concept of what it means to be a 
risk-taker in the way a successful trader thinks about risk. The best traders not only take the risk, they 
have also learned to accept and embrace that risk . There is a huge psychological gap between assuming 
you are a risk-taker because you put on trades and fully accepting the risks inherent in each t rade. 
When you fully accept the risks, it will have profound implications on your bottom-line pe rformance. 
The best traders can put on a trade without the slightest bit of hesitation or conflict, and just as fr eely 
and without hesitation or conflict, admit it isn't working. They can get out of the trade— even with a 
loss—and doing so doesn't resonate the slightest bit of emotional discomfort. In other word s, the risks 
inherent in trading do not cause the best traders to lose their discipline, focus, or sense of confidence. 
If you are unable to trade without the slightest bit of emotional discomfort (specifical ly, fear), then you 
have not learned how to accept the risks inherent in trading. This is a big problem, because to whateve r 
degree you haven't accepted the risk, is the same degree to which you will avoid the risk. Trying to 
avoid something that is unavoidable will have disa strous effects on your ab ility to trade successfully. 
Learning to truly accept the risks in any endeavor can be difficult, but it is extrem ely difficult for 
traders, especially considering what's at stake. What are we generally most afraid of (besides dying  or 
public speaking)? Certainly, losing money and being wrong both rank close to the top of the li st. 
Admitting we are wrong and losing money to boot can be  extremely painful, and certainly something to 
avoid. Yet as traders, we are confronted with these two possibilities virtually ever y moment we are in a 
trade. Now, you might be saying to yourself, "Apart from the fact that it hurts so much, it's natu ral to 
not want to be wrong and lose some thing; therefore, it's appropriate for me to do whatever I can to 
avoid it." I agree with you. But it is also this natu ral tendency that makes tr ading (which looks like it 
should be easy) extremely difficult. 
Trading presents us with a fundamental paradox: How do we remain disciplined, focused, and 
confident in the face of constant uncertainty? When you have learned how to "think" like a trader, that's 
exactly what you'll be able to do. Learning how to redefine your trading activities in a way that allows 
you to completely accept the risk is the key to thinking like a successful trader. Learning to  accept the 
risk is a trading skill—the most important skill you can learn. Yet it's rare that developing traders focus 
any attention or expend any effort to learn it. 
When you learn the trading skill of risk acceptance, th e market will not be able  to generate information 
that you define or interpret as painful. If the info rmation the market generates doesn't have the potential 
to cause you emotional pain, there's nothing to avoid. It is just information, telling you w hat the 
possibilities are. This is called an objective perspective—one that is not skewed or disto rted by what 
you are afraid is going to happen or not happen. 
I'm sure there isn't one trader reading this book who hasn't gotten into trades too soon—before the 
market has actually generated a signal, or too late—long after the market has generated a signal. What 
trader hasn't convinced himself not to take a loss and,  as a result, had it turn into a bigger one; or got 
out of winning trades too soon; or found himself in winning trades but didn't take any profits at all, and 
then let the trades turn into losers; or moved stoplosses closer to his entry point, only to get s topped out 
and have the market go back in his direction? These are but a few of the many errors traders perp etuate 
upon themselves time and time again. These are not market-generated errors. That is, these e rrors do 
not come from the market. The market is neutral, in  the sense that it moves and generates information 
about itself. Movement and information provide each of us with the opportunity to do something, but 
that's all! The markets don't have any power over the unique way in which each of us perceives and 
interprets this information, or control of the decisions and actions we take as a result. The errors I 
already mentioned and many more are strictly the result of what I call "faulty trading attitudes and 
perspectives." Faulty attitudes that foster fear instead of trust and confidence. 
I don't think I could put the difference between the consistent winners and everyone else more simply 
than this: The best traders aren't afraid. They aren't afra id because they have developed attitudes that 
give them the greatest degree of mental flexibility to flow in and out of trades based on what t he market 
is telling them about the possibilities from its persp ective. At the same time, the best traders have 
developed attitudes that prevent them from getting reckless. Everyone else is afraid, to som e degree or 
another. When they're not afraid, they have the tendency to become reckless and to  create the kind of 
experience for themselves that will cause them to be afraid from that point on. 
Ninety-five percent of the trading errors you are likely to make—causing the money to jus t evaporate 
before your eyes—will stem from your attitudes ab out being wrong, losing money, missing out, and 
leaving money on the table. What I call the four primary trading fears. 
Now, you may be saying to yourself, "I don't know about this: I've always thought traders should  have 
a healthy fear of the markets." Again, this is a perfectly logical and reasonable assumption. But when it 
comes to trading, your fears will act against you in  such a way that you will cause the very thing you 
are afraid of to actually happen. If you're afraid of  being wrong, your fear will act upon your perception 
of market information in a way that will cause you to do something that ends  up making you wrong. 
When you are fearful, no other possibilities exist. Y ou can't perceive other possibilities or act on them 
properly, even if you did manage to perceive them, because fear is immobilizing.  Physically, it causes 
us to freeze or run. Mentally, it causes us to narrow our focus of attention to the object of our fear. This 
means that thoughts about other possibilities, as well as other ava ilable information from the market, 
get blocked. You won't think about all the rational things you've lear ned about the market until you are 
no longer afraid and the event is over. Then you w ill think to yourself, "I knew that. Why didn't I think 
of it then?" or, "Why couldn't I act on it then?" 
It's extremely difficult to perceive that the source of these problems is our own in appropriate attitudes. 
That's what makes fear so insidious. Many of the thinking patterns that adversely affect our trading are 
a function of the natural ways in which we were brought up to think and see the world. These thi nking 
patterns are so deeply ingrained that it rarely occurs to us that the source of our trading difficulties is 
internal, derived from our state of mind. Indeed, it seems much more natural to see the source of a 
problem as external, in the market, because it feels like the market is causing our pain, frustration, and 
dissatisfaction. 
Obviously these are abstract concepts and certainly not something most traders are going to concern 
themselves with. Yet understanding the relationship between  beliefs, attitudes, and perception is as 
fundamental to trading as learning how to serve is to  tennis, or as learning how to swing a club is to 
golf. Put another way, understanding and controllin g your perception of market information is 
important only to the extent that you want to achieve consistent results. 
I say this because there is something else about tradin g that is as true as the statement I just made: You 
don't have to know anything about yourself or the markets to put on a winning tra de, just as you don't 
have to know the proper way to swing a tennis racket or golf club in order to hit a good shot from time 
to time. The first time I played golf, I hit several good shots throughout the game even though I hadn't 
learned any particular technique; but my score was still over 120 for 18 holes. Obviously, to improve 
my overall score, I needed to learn technique. Of course, the same is true for trading. We need 
technique to achieve consistency. But what technique?  This is truly one of the most perplexing aspects 
of learning how to trade effectively. If we aren 't aware of, or don't understand, how our beliefs and 
attitudes affect our perception of market information, it wi ll seem as if it is the market's behavior that is 
causing the lack of consistency. As a result, it would stand to reason that the best way to avoid l osses 
and become consistent would be to learn more about the markets. 
This bit of logic is a trap that almost all traders fall into at some point, and it seems to make perfect 
sense. But this approach doesn't work. The market simply offers too many—often conflicting—
variables to consider. Furthermore, there are no limits to the market's behavior. It can do a nything at 
any moment. As a matter of fact, because every person who trades is a market variable, it can be said 
that any single trader can cause virtually anything to happen. This means  that no matter how much you 
learn about the market's behavior, no matter how brilliant an analyst you become, yo u will never learn 
enough to anticipate every possible way that the market can make you wrong or cause you to lose 
money. So if you are afraid of being wrong or lo sing money, it means you will never learn enough to 
compensate for the negative effects these fears will have on your ability to be obje ctive and your ability 
to act without hesitation. In other words, you won't be  confident in the face of constant uncertainty. The 
hard, cold reality of trading is that every trade has an uncertain outcome. Unless you learn to 
completely accept the possibility of an uncertain outcome, you will try either consciously or 
unconsciously to avoid any possibility you define as pa inful. In the process, you will subject yourself to 
any number of self-generated, costly errors. 
Now, I am not suggesting that we don't need some form of market analysis or meth odology to define 
opportunities and allow us to recogn ize them; we certainly do. However, market analysis is not the path 
to consistent results. It will not solve the tradin g problems created by lack of confidence, lack of 
discipline, or improper focus. When you operate from the assumption that more or be tter analysis will 
create consistency, you will be driven  to gather as many market variables as possible into your arsenal 
of trading tools. But what happen s then? You are still disappointed a nd betrayed by the markets, time 
and again, because of something yo u didn't see or give enough consid eration to. It will feel like you 
can't trust the markets; but the reality is, you can't trust yourself. 
Confidence and fear are contradictory states of mind that both stem from our beliefs an d attitudes. To 
be confident, functioning in an environment where you can easily lose more than you inten d to risk, 
requires absolute trust in yoursel f. However, you won't be able to  achieve that trust until you have 
trained your mind to override your natural inclination to think in ways that are counterproductive to 
being a consistently successful trader. Learning how to analyze the market's behavior is simp ly not the 
appropriate training. You have two choices: You can try to eliminate risk by learning about as many 
market variables as possible. (I call this the black ho le nf analv<!i<: bpoanif* it  is fhp nafh nf ultimate 
frustration.) Or you can learn how to redefine your trading activities in such a way that you truly accept 
the risk, and you're no longer afraid.  
When you've achieved a state of mind where you truly accept the risk, you won't have the potentia l to 
define and interpret market inform ation in painful ways. When you eliminate the potential to define 
market information in painful ways, you also eliminate the tendency to rationalize, hesitate, jump the 
gun, hope that the market will gi ve you money, or hope that the market will save you from your 
inability to cut your losses. 
As long as you are susceptible to the lands of errors that are the result of rationali zing, justifying, 
hesitating, hoping, and jumping the gun, you will not be able to trust yourself. If you can' t trust yourself 
to be objective and to always act in your own best inte rests, achieving consistent results will be next to 
impossible. Trying to do something that looks so si mple may well be the most exasperating thing you 
will ever attempt to do. The irony is that, when you have the appropriate attitude, wh en you have 
acquired a "trader s mind-set" and can remain confident in the face of constant uncertainty, t rading will 
be as easy and simple as you probably thought it was when you first started out. 
So, what is the solution? You will need to learn how to adjust your attitudes and beliefs about tr ading in 
such a way that you can trade without the slightest bit of fear, but at the same time keep a framework in 
place that does not allow you to become reckless. That's exactly what this book is designed to teach 
you. As you move ahead, I would like you to keep something in mind. 
The successful trader that you want to become is a future projection of yourself that you have to grow 
into. Growth implies expansion, learning, and creating a new way of expressing yourself. This is true 
even if you're already a successful trader and are reading this book to become more successful. Many 
of the new ways in which you will learn to express yourself will be in direct conflict with ideas and 
beliefs you presently hold about the nature of trading. You may or may not alread y be aware of some of 
these beliefs. In any case, what you currently hold to be true about the nature of  trading will argue to 
keep things just the way they are, in spite of your frustrations and unsatisfying results. 
These internal arguments are natural.  My challenge in this book is to  help you resolve these arguments 
as efficiently as possible. Your willingness to consider that other possibil ities exist—possibilities that 
you may not be aware of or may not have given enough consideration to—will obviously m ake the 
learning process faster and easier. 
 
CHAPTER 2  
 
THE LURE 
(AND THE DANGERS) 
OF TRADING 
 
In January 1994, I was asked to speak at a trading conference in Chicago, sponsored by Futures  
Magazine. At one of the luncheons I happened to be sitting next to an editor for one of the major 
publishers of books about trading. We were havi ng a lively conversation about why so few people 
become successful at trading, even people who are otherwise very accomplished . At one point, the 
editor asked me if a possible explanation for this phenomenon might be that people were getting into 
trading for the wrong reasons. 
 
THE ATTRACTION 
 
I had to pause for a moment to think about this. I agree that many of the typical reasons people are 
motivated to trade—the action, euphoria, desire to be a hero, the attention one can draw to himself by 
winning, or the self-pity that comes from losing—cr eate problems that will ultimately detract from a 
traders performance and overall success. But the tr ue underlying attraction to trading is far more 
fundamental and universal. Trading is an activity that offers the individual unlimited free dom of 
creative expression, a freedom of expression that has been denied most of us for most of ou r lives. 
Of course, the editor asked me what I meant by this. I explained that in the trading environment, we 
make almost all of the rules. This means there are very few restrictions or boundaries on how we can 
choose to express ourselves. Of course there are some formalities such as having to become a member 
of an exchange to be a floor trader, or meeting the minimum financial requirements to open  a brokerage 
account if you're an off- the-floor trader. But otherwise, once you are in a position to start trading, the 
possibilities that exist for how you go about doing it are virtually limitless. 
I went on to give him an example from a seminar I attended several years ago. Someone had calc ulated 
that, if you combined bond  futures, bond options, and the cash bond markets, there would be over eight 
billion possible spread combinations. Now add the ti ming considerations based on how you read the  
revailing market conditions, and the various ways to trade become virtually limitless.  
The editor paused for a moment and asked, "But why would having access to such an unre stricted 
environment result in fairly consistent failure?" I answered, "Because unlimited possibilities coupled 
with the unlimited freedom to take advantage of those possibilities present the individual with unique 
and specialized psychological challenges, challenges that very few people are properly equi pped to deal 
with, or have any awareness of for that matter, and people can't exactly work on overcoming so mething 
if they don't even know its a problem." 
The freedom is great. All of us seem to naturally want it, strive for it, even crave it. But that doesn't ean  
that we have the appropriate psychological resources to operate effectively in an environment that has 
few, if any, boundaries and where the potential to do enormous damage to ourselves exists. Almost 
everyone needs to make some mental adjustments, regardless of their educational bac kground, 
intelligence or how successful they've been in other endeavors. 
The kind of adjustments I'm talking about have to do  with creating an internal mental structure that 
provides the trader with the greatest degree of balance between the freedom to do anything an d the 
potential that exists to experience both the financial and psychological damage that can  be a direct 
result of that freedom.  
Creating a mental structure can be difficult enough, es pecially if what you want to instill is in conflict 
with what you already believe. But for those of us who want to be traders, the difficul ty of creating the 
appropriate structure is invariably compounded by a backlog of mental resi stance that starts developing 
at the very earliest stages of our lives.  
All of us are born into some sort of social environment. A social environment ( or society), whether it's 
a family, city, state, or country, implies the existence of structure. Social structures consist of rules, 
restrictions, boundaries, and a set of beliefs that become a code of behavior that limits the  ways in 
which individuals within that social structure can or cannot express themselves. Furthermore, m ost of 
the limitations of social structure were established before we are born. In other words, by the ti me any 
of us get here, most of the social structure governing our individual expression is in place and well 
entrenched. It's easy to see why a society's need for structure and the individual's need for self-
expression can conflict. Every person who wants to master the art of trading faces just such a 
fundamental conflict. I'd like you to ask yourself what one characteristic (a form of personal 
expression) is common to every child born on this planet, regardless of the loc ation, culture, or social 
situation the child is born into. The answer is curiosit y. Every child is curious. Every child is eager to 
learn. They can be described as little learning machines. 
Consider the nature of curiosity. At its most fundamental level, it is a force. More specifically, it is an 
inner-directed force, which means there's no necessity to motivate a child to learn something. Left on 
their own, children will naturally explore their surroundings. What is more, this inner-directed force 
also seems to have its own agenda; in other words, even though all children are curious, not al l children 
are naturally curious about the same things. There's something inside each of us that directs our 
awareness. 
Even infants seem to know what they want and don't want. When adults encounter this unique display 
of individuality expressed by an infant, they're usually surprised. They assume  that infants have 
nothing inside of them that makes them uniquely who they are. How else would infants express their 
individuality than by what in their environment attr acts or repels them? I call this inner-directed 
guidance the force of natural attractions. 
Natural attractions are simply those things about which we feel a natural or passionate interest. Ours is 
a big and diverse world, and it offers each of us a great deal to learn about and experien ce. But that 
doesn't mean each of us has a natural or passionate interest in learning about or experi encing all there 
is. There's some internal mechanism that makes us "naturally selective." 
If you think about it, I'm sure you could list many th ings to do or be that you have absolutely no 
interest in. I know I could. You could also make another list of the things you are only marginal ly 
interested in. Finally, you could list everything you have a passionate interest in. Of course, the lis ts get 
smaller as the interest levels rise . Where does passionate interest come from? My personal view is that 
it comes from the deepest level of our being—at the level of our true identity. It c omes from the part of 
us that exists beyond the characteristics and personality traits we acquire as a result of our social 
upbringing. 
 
THE DANGERS 
 
It is at the deepest level of our being that the potent ial for conflict exists.The social structure that we're 
born into may or may not be sensitive to these inner-directed needs and interest s. For example, you 
may have been born into a family of extremely competitive athletes, but feel a passionate interest in  
classical music or art. You may even have natural athletic ability, but no real interest in participating in 
athletic events. Is there any potential for conflict here? 
In a typical family, most members would put a great deal of pressure on you to follow in the footsteps 
of your brothers, sisters, or parents. They do everything possible to teach you thei r ways and how to get 
the most out of your athletic ability. They discourage you from seriously pursuing any other interests. 
You go along with what they want, because you don't want to be ostracized, but at the same time, doing 
what they want you to do just doesn't feel right, although everything you've lea rned and been taught 
argues in favor of becoming an athlete. The problem is, it doesn't feel like who you ar e. 
The conflicts that result from what we're taught about  who we're supposed to be and the feeling that 
resonates at the deepest levels of our being is not at all uncommon. I would say that many , if not most 
people, grow up in a family and cultural environment that gives little, if any, objective, nonjudgmental 
support to the unique ways in which we feel compelled to express ourselves. This lack of support is not 
simply an absence of encouragement. It can be as deep as the outright denial of some particular  way in 
which we want to express ourselves. For example, le t's look at a common situation: A toddler, who for 
the first time in his life, notices "this thing," which we call a vase, on the coffee table. He is curious, 
which means there's an inner force that's compelling him to experience this object. In a sense, it's  as if 
this force creates a vacuum in his mind that has to be filled with the object  of his interest. So, he 
focuses on the vase, and, with deliberate intent, crawls across the vast expanse of the livi ng room floor 
to the coffee table. When he gets there, he reaches up to the edge of the table to pull him self to his feet. 
With one hand firmly on the table to  maintain his balance, his other ha nd reaches out to touch this thing 
he has never experienced. Just at that moment, he hears a scream from across the room, "NO! DON'T 
TOUCH THAT!" 
Startled, the child falls back on his butt, and begins to cry. Obviously, this is a very commo n 
occurrence and one that is completely unavoidable. Children have absolutely no concept of how they 
can injure themselves or how valuable something like a vase can be. In fact, learning what is safe and 
what isn't and the value of things are important lessons the child must learn. However, there are som e 
extremely important psychological dynamics at work here that have a direct effect on our ability to 
create the kind of discipline and focus necessary to trade effectively later in life. 
What happens when we're denied the opportunity to express ourselves in the way we want to, or we're 
forced to express ourselves in a way that doesn't correspond with the natural selection process?  
The experience creates an upset. Being "up-set" implies an imbalance. But what exactly is out of 
balance? For something to be out of balance, there has to be something that's in balance or in equal 
proportion in the first place. That something is the relative degree of co rrespondence that exists 
between our inner, mental environment and the exterior environment where we experience our lives. In  
other words, our needs and desires are generated in our mental environment, and they ar e fulfilled in 
the exterior environment . If these two environments are in correspondence with one another, we're in a 
state of inner balance and we feel a sense of satisfaction or happiness. If these envir onments are not in 
correspondence, we experience dissatisfaction, anger, and frustration, or what is commonly referred to 
as emotional pain. 
Now, why would not getting what we want or being denied the freedom to express ourselves in some  
particular way cause us to experience emotional pain? My personal theory is that needs and desires 
create mental vacuums. The universe in which we liv e has a natural tendency to not tolerate a vacuum 
and moves to fill it, whenever one exists. (The philosopher Spinoza observed centuries ago that, 
"Nature abhors a vacuum.") 
Suck the air out of a bottle and yo ur tongue and lips will stick to th e mouth of the bot tle, because you 
have created an imbalance (a vacuum), which now must be filled. What are the dynamics behind the 
expression "Necessity is the mother of all invention"? The recognition that a need creates a mental 
vacuum that the universe will fill with inspiring thoughts (if your mind is receptive). The thoughts, in 
turn, can inspire movement and expression that result in the fulfillment of that need. 
In this respect, I think our mental environment works like the universe at large. Once  we recognize a 
need or desire, we move to fill the vacuum with an experience in the exterior environment. If we are 
denied the opportunity to pursue the object of this need or desire, it literally feels as if we are not 
whole, or that something is missing, which puts us into a state of imbalance or emotiona l pain. (Do our 
minds also abhor a vacuum, once one has been created?) Take a toy away from a child who is not 
finished playing with it (regardless of how good your reasons may be for doing so) and the universal 
response will be emotional pain.  
By the time we're 18 years old, we've been on Earth approximately 6,570 days. On a verage, how many 
times per day does the typical child hear statements like: 
 
"No, no, you can't do that." 
"You can't do it that way. You have to do it this way." 
"Not now; let me think about it." 
"I'll let you know." 
"It can't be done." 
"What makes you think you can do it?" 
"You have to do it. You have no choice." 
 
These are just a few of the relatively nice ways in which all of us are denied individual expres sion as 
we grow up. Even if we only heard such statements on ce or twice a day, that still adds up to several 
thousand denials by the time we reach adulthood.  
I call these lands of experiences "denied impulses" to learn— impulses that are based on a n inner need, 
originating from the deeper part of our identity, from the natural selection process.  
What happens to all of these impulses that have been denied and left unfulfilled? Do they just go away? 
They can, if they are reconciled in some way: if we do something, or someone else does something, to 
put our mental environment back into balance. What can put our mental environment bac k into 
balance? There are a number of techniques.  
The most natural one, especially for a child, is simply to cry. Crying is a natural mechanism (nature' s 
way) for reconciling these denied, unfulfilled impulses. Scientific researchers have found tears t o be 
composed of negatively charged ions. If allowed to take its natural cour se, crying will expel the 
negatively charged energy in our minds and bring us back to a state of balance, even though the 
original impulse was never fulfilled. 
The problem is that, most of the time, events are not allowed to take their natural course  and the denied 
impulses are never reconc iled (at least, not while we're still ch ildren). There are many reasons why 
adults don't like it when their children (especially boy s) cry, and do everything they can to discourage 
this behavior. There are just as many reasons why adul ts will not bother to explain to children why they 
are being forced to do something they don't want to do. Even if adults do try, there a re no assurances 
that they will be effective enough to reconcile the imbalance. What happens if these impulses aren't 
reconciled?  
They accumulate and usually end up manifesting themselves in any number of addictive and 
compulsive behavior patterns. A very loose rule of thumb is: Whatever we believe we we re deprived of 
as children can easily become addictions in adulth ood. For example, many people are addicted to 
attention. I am referring to people who will do most anything to draw attention to themselv es. The most 
common reason for this is that they believe they either didn't get enough attention when the y were 
young or didn't get it when it was important to them. In any case, the deprivation becomes unresolved 
emotional energy that compels them to behave in ways that will satisfy the addiction. What's important 
for us to understand about these unreconciled, denied  impulses (that exist in all of us) is how they 
affect our ability to stay focused and take a disciplined, consistent approac h to our trading.  
 
THE SAFEGUARDS 
 
To operate effectively in the trading environment, we need rules and boundaries to guide our behavior. 
It is a simple fact of trading that the potential exis ts to do enormous damage to ourselves—damage that 
can be way out of proportion to what we may think is possible. There are many kinds of tra des in 
which the risk of loss is unlimited.  
To prevent the possibility of exposing ourselves to da mage, we need to create an internal structure in 
the form of specialized mental discipline and a perspective that guides our behavior so that we alway s 
act in our own best interests. This structure has to exist within each of us, because unlike socie ty, the 
market doesn't provide it. The markets provide structure in the form of behavior patterns th at indicate 
when an opportunity to buy or sell exists. But that's where the structure ends—with a simp le indication. 
Otherwise, from each individual's perspective, ther e are no formalized rules to guide your behavior. 
There aren't even any beginnings, middles, or endings as there are in virtually every oth er activity we 
participate in. 
This is an extremely important distinction with profound psychological implications.  The market is like 
a stream that is in constant motion. It doesn't start, stop, or wait. Even when the markets are closed, 
prices are still in motion. There is no rule that the opening price on any day must be the same as the 
closing price the day before. Nothing we do in society properly prepares us to function effecti vely in 
such a "boundary-less" environment. Even gambling games have built-in structures that make them 
much different from trading, and a lot less dangerous. For example, if we decide to play bl ackjack, the 
first thing we have to do is decide how much we are going to wager or risk. This is a cho ice we are 
forced to make by the rules of the game. If we don't make the choice, we don't get to play. 
In trading, no one (except yourself) is going to force you to decide in advance what your risk is. In fact, 
what we have is a limitless environment, where virtually anything can happen at any mom ent and only 
the consistent winners define their risk in advance of putting on a trade. For everyone else, defining th e 
risk in advance would force you to confront the rea lity that each trade has a probable outcome, meaning 
that it could be a loser. Consistent losers do almost anything to avoid accepting the reality t hat, no 
matter how good a trade looks, it could lose. Without the presence of an external structure forcing th e 
typical trader to think otherwise, he is susceptible to any number of justificat ions, rationalizations, and 
the kind of distorted logic that will allow him to get into a trade believing that it can't lose, which 
makes determining the risk in advance irrelevant. 
All gambling games have specified beginnings, middles, and endings, based on a sequence of events 
that determine the outcome of the game. Once you decide you are going to participate, you can't change 
your mind—you're in for the duration. That's not true of trading. In trading, prices are in c onstant 
motion, nothing begins until you decide it should, it lasts as long as you want, and it doesn't end until 
you want it to be over. Regardless of what you may have planned or wanted to do, a ny number of 
psychological factors can come into play, causing you to become distracted, change your mind, becom e 
scared or overconfident: in other words, causing you to behave in ways that are errat ic and unintended. 
Because gambling games have a formal ending, they force the participant to be an acti ve loser. If you're 
on a losing streak, you can't keep on losing without making a conscious decision to do  so. The end of 
each game causes the beginning of a new game, and you have to actively subject m ore of your assets to 
further risk by reaching into your wallet or pushing some chips to the center of the table. 
Trading has no formal ending. The market will not take you out of a trade. Unless you have the  
appropriate mental structure to end a trade in a manner that is always in your best interest , you can 
become a passive loser. This means that, once you're in a losing trade, you don't have to do a nything to 
keep on losing. You don't even have to watch. You can just ignore the situation, and the market will 
take everything you own—and more. 
One of the many contradictions of trading is that it o ffers a gift and a curse at the same time. The gift is 
that, perhaps for the first time in our  lives, we're in complete control of everything we do. The curse is 
that there are no external rules or boundaries to guide or structure our behavior. The unlimited 
characteristics of the trading environment require that  we act with some degree of restraint and self-
control, at least if we want to create some measure of consistent success. The structure we need to 
guide our behavior has to originate in your mind, as a conscious act of free will. This is wher e the many 
problems begin. 
 
PROBLEM: The willingness to Create Rules 
 
I have not yet encountered a person interested in trad ing who didn't resist the notion of creating a set of 
rules. The resistance isn't always overt. Quite the contrary, it's usually very subtle.  We agree on the one 
hand that rules make sense, but we really have no intention of doing whateve r is being suggested. This 
resistance can be intense, and it has a logical source. 
Most of the structure in our minds was given to us as a result of our social upbringing and based on 
choices made by other people. In ot her words, it was instilled in our minds, but did not originate in our 
minds. This is a very important distinction. In the process of instilling structure, many  of our natural 
impulses to move, express, and learn about the nature of our existence through our own direct 
experience were denied. Many of these denied impulses were never reconciled and still exis t inside of 
us as frustration, anger, disappointment, guilt, or  even hatred. The accumulation of these negative 
feelings acts as a force inside our mental environment causing us to resist anything that deni es us the 
freedom to do and be whatever we want, when we want. 
In other words, the very reason we are attracted to  trading in the first place—the unlimited freedom of 
creative expression—is the same reason we feel a na tural resistance to creating the kinds of rules and 
boundaries that can appropriately guide our behavior. It's  as if we have found a Utopia in which there is 
complete freedom, and then someone taps us on the shoulder and says, "Hey, you have to create rules , 
and not only that, you also have to have the discipline to abide by them." 
The need for rules may make perfect sense, but it can be difficult to generate the motiva tion to create 
these rules when we've been trying to break free of them most of our lives. It usually takes a great deal  
of pain and suffering to break down the source of our resistance to establishing and abid ing by a trading 
regime that is organized, consistent, and reflects prudent money-management guidelines. Now, I'm no t 
implying that you have to reconcile all of your past frustrations and disappointments to beco me a 
successful trader, because that's not the case. And you certainly don't have to suffer.  
I've worked with many traders who have achieved their objectives of consistency and ha ven't done 
anything to reconcile their backlog of denied impulses. However, I am implying that you can' t take for 
granted how much effort and focus you may have to put into building the ki nd of mental structure that 
compensates for the negative effect de nied impulses can have on your ab ility to establish the skills that 
will assure your success as a trader. 
 
PROBLEM: Failure to Take Responsibility 
 
Trading can be characterized as a pure, unencumbered personal choice with an immediate outcome. 
Remember, nothing happens until we decide to start; it lasts as long as we want; and it doesn't end until 
we decide to stop. All of these beginnings, middles, and endings are the result of our interpre tation of 
the information available and how we choose to act  on our interpretation. Now, we may want the 
freedom to make choices, but that doesn't mean we are ready and willing to accept the resp onsibility 
for the outcomes. Traders who are not ready to accept responsibility for the outcomes of their 
interpretations and actions will find themselves in a dilemma: How does one participate in an activity 
that allows complete freedom of choice, and at the same time avoid taking responsibility if the outcome 
of one's choices are unexpected and not to one's liking? 
The hard reality of trading is that, if you want to create consistency, you have to start from the premise  
that no matter what the outcome, you are completely responsible. This is a level of responsibil ity few 
people have aspired to before they decide to become traders. The way to avoid responsibility is to adopt 
a trading style that is, to all in tents and purposes, random. I define random trading as poorly-planned 
trades or trades that are not planned at all. It is an  unorganized approach that takes into consideration an 
unlimited set of market variables, which do not allow you to find out what works on a consistent basis 
and what does not. 
Randomness is unstructured fr eedom without responsibility. 
When we trade without well-defined plans and with an unlimited set of variables, it's very e asy to take 
credit for the trades that turn out to our liking (be cause there was "some" method present). At the same 
time, it's veiy easy to avoid taking responsibility for the trades that didn't turn out the way we wanted 
(because there's always some variable we didn't know about and therefore couldn't take into 
consideration beforehand). If the markets behavior were truly random, then it would be diffi cult if not 
impossible to create consistency. If it's impossible to  be consistent, then we re ally don't have to take 
responsibility. The problem with this logic is that  our direct experience of the markets tells us 
something different. The same behavior patterns pres ent themselves over and over again. Even though 
the outcome of each individual pattern is random, the outcome of a series of patterns is consis tent 
(statistically reliable). This is a paradox, but one th at is easily resolved with a disciplined, organized, 
and consistent approach. 
I've worked with countless traders who would spend hours doing market analysis and pla nning trades 
for the next day Then, instead of putting on the trades they planned, they did some thing else. The trades 
they did put on were usually ideas from friends or tips from brokers. I probably don't hav e to tell you 
that the trades they originally planned, but didn't act on, were usually the big winners of the day.  
This is a classic example of how we become susceptible to unstructured, random trading—because we 
want to avoid responsibility. When we act on our own ideas, we put our creative abilit ies on the line 
and we get instant feedback on how well our ideas worked. It's very difficult to rationalize away  any 
unsatisfactory results. On the other hand, when we enter an unplanned, random trade, it's much easier 
to shift the responsibility by blaming the friend or the broker for their bad ideas. 
There's something else about the nature of trading that makes it easy to escape the responsibility that 
comes with creating structure in favor of trading randomly: It is the fact that any trad e has the potential 
to be a winner, even a big winner. That big winning trade can come your way whether you are a great 
analyst or a lousy one; whether you do or don't take responsibility. It takes effort to cre ate the kind of 
disciplined approach that is necessary to become a consistent winner. But, as you can see, it's very easy 
to avoid this kind of mental work in favor of trading with an undisciplined, random appr oach. 
 
PROBLEM: Addiction to Random Rewards 
 
Several studies have been done on the psychologi cal effects of random rewards on monkeys. For 
example, if you teach a monkey to do a task and consistently reward it every time the task  is done, the 
monkey quickly learns to associate a specific outcome  with the efforts. If you stop rewarding it for 
doing the task, within a very short period of time the monkey will simply stop doing the task. It won't 
waste its energy doing something that it has now learned it won't be rewarded for. However, the 
monkey's response to being cut off from the reward is very different if you start out on a pur ely random 
schedule, instead of a consistent one. When you stop offering the reward, there's no way  the monkey 
can know that it will never be rewarded again for doing that task. Every time it was rewarded in the 
past, the reward came as a surprise. As a result, from the monkey's perspective, there's no reas on to quit 
doing the task. The monkey keeps on doing the task, even without being rewarded for doing it. Some 
will continue indefinitely. 
I'm not sure why we're susceptible to becoming addicted to random rewards. If I had to guess, I would 
say that it probably has something to do with the euphoria-inducing chemicals that are released in our 
brains when we experience an unexpected, pleasant surprise. If a reward is random, we never know for 
sure if and when we might receive it, so expending energy and resources in the hope of experiencing 
that wonderful feeling of surprise again isn't difficult. In fact, for many people it can be very addicting. 
On the other hand, when we expect a particular outcome and it doesn't come about, we're disappointed 
and feel bad. If we do it again and get the same disappointing outcome, it isn't likely that we will keep 
doing something we know will cause us emotional pain. 
The problem with any addiction is that it leaves us in a state of "choicelessness." To whatever degree  
the addiction dominates our state of mind, to that same degree our focus and efforts will be geared 
toward fulfilling the object of that addiction. Other po ssibilities that exist in any given moment to fulfill 
other needs (like the need to trust ourselves and not to  subject too many of our a ssets to risk) are either 
ignored or dismissed. We feel powerless to act in any other way than to satisfy the addiction. An 
addiction to random rewards is particularly troublesome for traders, because it is anot her source of 
resistance to creating the kind of mental structure that produces consistency. 
 
PROBLEM: External versus Internal Control 
 
Our upbringing has programmed us to function in a social environment, which means we' ve acquired 
certain thinking strategies for fulfilling our needs, wants and desires that are geared toward social 
interaction. Not only have we lear ned to depend on each other to fulfill the needs, wants and desires we 
cannot fulfill completely on our own, but in the process we've acquired many socially-based contr olling 
and manipulating techniques for assuring that other people behave in a mann er that is consistent with 
what we want.  
The markets may seem like a social endeavor because there are so many people involved, but they're  
not. If, in today's modern society, we have learned to depend on each other to fulfill basic needs, then 
the market environment (even though it exists in the midst of modern society) can be characterized as a 
psychological wilderness, where it's truly every man or woman for himself  or herself. Not only can we 
not depend on the market to do anything for us, but it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, t o 
manipulate or control anything that the market does . Now, if we've become effective at fulfilling our 
needs, wants and desires by learning how to control and manipulate our environment, but suddenly find 
ourselves, as traders, in an environment that doe s not know, care, or respond to anything that is 
important to us, where does that leave us? You're right if you said up the proverbial creek without a 
paddle.  
One of the principal reasons so many successful people have failed miserably at  trading is that their 
success is partly attributable to their superior ability to manipulate and control the social environment, 
to respond to what they want. To some degree, all of us have learned or developed techniques to make 
the external environment conform to our mental (interior) environment. The problem is that none of  
these techniques work with the market. The market doesn't respond to control an d manipulation (unless 
you're a very large trader). However, we can control our perception and interpretation of  market 
information, as well as our own behavior. Instead of controlling our surroundings so  they conform to 
our idea of the way things should be, we can learn to control ourselves. Then we c an perceive 
information from the most objective perspective possible, and structure our mental environ ment so that 
we always behave in a manner that is in our own best interest. 
CHAPTER 3  
 
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY 
 
Although the words "taking responsib ility" sound simple, the concept is neither easy to grasp nor easy 
to put into practice in your trading. We have all heard the words and been confronted with the need to  
take responsibility so many times in our lives that it is easy to take for granted that we know exactly 
what the phrase means. 
Taking responsibility in y our trading and learning the appropriate principles of success are inextricably 
connected. You have to understand, with every fiber of your being, the ways in whic h you are and are 
not responsible for your success as a trader. Only then can you take on the characteristics that will 
allow you to join the select group of traders who are consistently successful i n the markets. 
At the end of Chapter 1, I introduced the idea of stepping into a future projection of yourself. In other 
words, the consistently successful trader that you want to become doesn't exist yet. You must create a 
new version of yourself, just as a sculptor creates a likeness of a model. 
 
SHAPING YOUR MENTAL ENVIRONMENT  
 
The tools you will use to create this new version of yourself are your willingness and desi re to learn, 
fueled by your passion to be succes sful. If the willingness and desire to learn are your primary tools, 
then what is your medium? An artist creating a sculpture can choose to work in a number of 
mediums—clay, marble, or metal, for example— but if you want to create a new version of your 
personality that expresses itself as a consistently successful trader, you have onl y your beliefs and 
attitudes. The medium for your artistic endeavor wi ll be your mental environment, where with your 
desire to learn, you can restructure and install the beliefs and attitudes that are necessary to achieve 
your ultimate goal. 
I am assuming your ultimate goal is consistency. If you're like most traders, you don't realize th e fullest 
potential of the opportunities available to you. To rea lize more and more of that potential, to make it 
more and more of a reality in your life, your primary goal has to be to learn how to  think like a 
consistently successful trader. Reme mber, the best traders think in a number of unique ways. They have 
acquired a mental structure that allows them to trade without fear and, at the same time, keeps them 
from becoming reckless and committing fear-based errors. This mind-set has a numb er of components, 
but the bottom line is that successful traders have virtually eliminated the effects of fear and 
recklessness from their trading.  
These two fundamental characteristics allow them to achieve consistent results.  
When you acquire this mind-set, you, too, will be able to trade without fear. You will no longer be 
susceptible to the multitude of fear-based errors that come from rationalizing, subconsciously distorting 
information, hesitating, jumping the gun, or hoping. Once the fear is gone, there just won't be a reason 
to make these errors and, as a result, they will virtually disappear from your trading.  
However, eliminating fear is only ha lf the equation. The other half is  the need to develop restraint. 
Excellent traders have learned that it is essential to  have internal discipline or a mental mechanism to 
counteract the negative effects of euphoria or the overconfidence that comes from a string of winning 
trades. For a trader, winning is extremely dangerous if you haven't learned how to monitor  and control 
yourself. 
If we start from the premise that to create consistency traders must focus their efforts on developing a 
trader's mind-set, then it is easy to see why so many traders don't succeed. Instead of lear ning to think 
like traders, they think about how they can make more money by learning about the markets. It's almost 
impossible not to fall into this trap . There are a number of psychological factors that make it very easy 
to assume that it's what you don't know about the mark ets that causes your losses and lack of consistent 
results.  
However, that's just not the case. The consistency you seek is in your mind, not in the markets. It's  
attitudes and beliefs about being wrong, losing money,  and the tendency to become reckless, when 
you're feeling good, that cause most losses—not technique or market knowledge. 
For example, if you could choose one of the following two traders to manage your money, w hich one 
would you pick? The first trader uses a simple, possibly even mediocre trading techniq ue, but possesses 
a mind-set that is not susceptible to subconsciously distorting market information, hesitating, 
rationalizing, hoping, or jumping the gun. The second trader is a phenomenal analyst, but is still 
operating out of the typical fears that make him susceptible to all of the psychologic al maladies that the 
other trader is free of. The right choice should be obvious. The first trader is going to achieve far better  
results with your money. 
Attitude produces better overall results than analysis or technique. Of course, the ideal situation is to 
have both, but you really don't need both, because if you have the right attitude—the right m ind-set—
then everything else about trading will be relatively easy, even simple, and certainly a lot more fun. I 
know for some of you this may be difficult to believe, or even distressing es pecially if you've been 
struggling for years to learn everything you can about the market. 
Interestingly, most traders are closer to the way they need to think when they first begin trading than at 
any other time in their careers. Many people begi n trading with a very unrealistic concept of the 
inherent dangers involved. This is particularly true if  their first trade is a winner. Then they go into the 
second trade with little or no fear. If that trade is a winner, they go into the next trade with even less 
concern for what would otherwise be the unacceptable possibility of a loss. Each subsequent win 
convinces them that there is nothing to fear and that trading is the easiest possible way to make money. 
This lack of fear translates into a carefree state of mind, similar to the state of mind m any great athletes 
describe as a "zone." If you've ever had the occasion to experience the zone in some sport, then you  
know it is a state of mind in which there is absolu tely no fear and you act and react instinctively. You 
don't weigh alternatives or consider consequences or second-guess yourself. You are in the moment 
and "just doing it." Whatever you do turns out to be exactly what needed to be done. 
Most athletes never reach this level of play, because they never get past the fear of maki ng a mistake. 
Athletes who reach the point where there is absolutely no fear of the consequences of screwing up will 
usually, and quite spontaneously, enter into "the zone." By the way, a psychologica l zone is not a 
condition you can will yourself into, the way you can will yourself into a feat of endurance. It is a state 
of mind you find yourself in that is inherently creative, and usually if you start thinking about your 
actions at a rational or conscious level, you pop right out of it. 
Even though you cannot force or will yourself into a zone, you can set up the kind of mental conditions 
that are most conducive to experiencing "the zone,"  by developing a positive winning attitude. I define 
a positive winning attitude as expecting a positive re sult from your efforts, with an acceptance that 
whatever results you get are a perfect reflection of your level of development and what you need to 
learn to do better. That's what the great athletes have: a winning attitude that allows them to easily 
move beyond their mistakes and keep eoine. 
Others get bogged down in negative self-criticism, regret, and selfpity . Not many people ever develop a 
positive winning attitude. The curious anomaly of trading is that, if you start with a winning trade, you 
will automatically experience the ki nd of carefree mind-set that is a by-product of a winning attitude, 
without having developed the attitude itself. I know  this may sound a bit confusing, but it has some 
profound implications. 
If a few winning trades can cause you to enter into the kind of carefree state of m ind that is an essential 
component to your success, but is not founded on the appropriate attitudes, then -what you have is a 
prescription for extreme misunderstanding about the nature of trading that inevit ably results in both 
emotional and financial disaster. Putting on a few (or more) winning trades does not mean you  have 
become a trader, but that's the way it feels, because it taps us into a state of mind that only the most 
accomplished people experience on a consistent basis. The fact is, you don't need the slightest bit of 
skill to put on a winning trade, and if it's possible to put on one winning trade without the slightest bit 
of skill, it is certainly possible to put on another and another. I know of several people who started their 
trading careers with fairly substa ntial strings of winning trades. 
When you're feeling confident and unencumbered by fears and worries, it isn't difficult to put on a 
string of winning trades because it's easy to get into a flow, a kind of natural rhythm, w here what you 
need to do seems obvious or self-evident. It's almost as if the market screams at you when to buy and 
when to sell, and you need very littl e in the way of analytical sophis tication. And, of course, because 
you have no fear, you can execute your trades with no internal argument or conflict. 
The point I am making is that winning in any endeavor  is mostly a function of attitude. Many people 
are certainly aware of this, but at the same time, most people don't understand the significan t part 
attitude plays in their results. In most sports or ot her competitive activities, participants must develop 
physical skills as well as mental skills in the form of strategies. If opponents are not evenly matched in 
the skills department, the one with superior skills usually ("but not always) wins. When an underdog 
beats a superior opponent, what's the determining factor? When two opponents are even ly matched, 
what's the factor that tips the balance one way or the other? In both cases, the answer is  attitude. 
What makes trading so fascinating and, at the same ti me, difficult to learn is that you really don't need 
lots of skills; you just need a ge nuine winning attitude. Experiencing a few or more winning trades can 
make you feel like a winner, and that feeling is wh at sustains the winning streak. This is why it is 
possible for a novice trader to put on a string of winning trades, when many of the industry 's best 
market analysts would give their right arms for a string of winning trades. The analysts have the skil ls, 
but they don't have the winning attitude.  
They're operating out of fear. The novice trader e xperiences the feeling of a winning attitude because 
he's not afraid. But that doesn't mean he has a winn ing attitude; it only means he hasn't experienced any 
pain from his trading activities to make him afraid. Eventually, our novice trader will experience a loss 
and being wrong, regardless of how positive he's feeling. Losing and being wrong are inevi table 
realities of trading. The most positive attitude imag inable coupled with the best analytical skills can't 
prevent a trader from eventually experiencing a losing trade. The markets are just too erratic and  there 
are too many variables to consider for any trader to be right every time. 
What happens when the novice trader finally does lose? What effect will it have on his c arefree state of 
mind? The answers will depend on his expectations going into the trade and how he interprets  the 
experience. And how he interprets the experience  is a function of his beliefs and attitudes. 
What if he is operating out of a belief that there's no possible way to avoid a loss, because losing is a 
natural consequence of trading — no different from, let's say, a restaurant owner incurring the ex pense 
of having to buy food? Furthermore, suppose that he has completely accepted the risk, meanin g that he 
has considered and accounted for all of what woul d otherwise be the unacceptable possibilities in the 
market's behavior, both financially and emotionally. 
With these beliefs and expectations, it is unlikely that he would experience a deteri oration of his 
attitude, and would simply go on to the next trade. By  the way, this is an example of an ideal set of 
trading beliefs and attitudes. 
Now suppose that he hasn't completely accepted the risk. What if his expectations didn't take into 
account any market behavior other than what he wanted? From this mental perspective, if the market 
doesn't do what he wants, he is going to feel pain—emotional pain. 
Expectations are our mental representations of how some future moment in the environment is goin g to 
look, sound, feel, smell, or taste. Depending upon how much energy is behind the expectation, it can 
hurt a lot when it isn't fulfilled. Of the two different pe rspectives I just described, which one is likely to 
be held by our novice trader? The latter, of course. Only the very best traders have acquired the 
perspective described in the first scenario. And, as I indicated in Chapter 1, un less these very best 
traders grew up in successful trading families or had super traders for mentors (whe re appropriate 
attitudes about risk and loss were instilled in them from the very beginning of their careers), virtually 
every one of them had the common experience of losing one or more fortunes before they realized how 
they needed to think in order to be consisten tly successful. 
It's a fundamental shift in attitude that accounts for their success, not some brillian t realization about 
the market, as most people erroneously assume. This erroneous assumption is prevalent among traders 
simply because very few of them really understand, at the deepest levels, just how critical a component 
attitude is in determining one's success. 
We can safely assume that after a loss, our novice trader will be in  a state of emotional pain. As a 
result, his trading will take on a whole new quality. He'll definitely lose that carefree sta te of mind, but 
more important, he will feel that the market did this  to him: The market caused him to feel the pain he 
is experiencing; the market took away his winning feeling by subjecting him to a loss. 
Notice how our trader is blaming the markets for losing or what he didn't get. No tice, too, how natural 
it is to feel the way he does. Think about how many times in our lives, especially as children, we were 
doing something we really enjoyed, like playing with a toy or with our friends, and so meone with more 
power and authority forced us to stop what we were  doing and do something we didn't want to do. All 
of us have lost things, had things taken away from us, been denied things we wanted or believed we 
deserved, been prevented from continuing an activity we were in the middle of,  or been blocked from 
pursuing an idea we were passionate  about. The point is that in many of these situations, we did not 
need to take personal res ponsibility for what ha ppened to us or for the pain  we experienced, because we 
were powerless to do anything about it.  
We didn't choose to be forced out of a state of joy and happiness, into a state of emotional pain. The 
decision was out of our hands, against our will, an d usually quite abrupt. Even though we may have 
been told we were responsible for what was happening to us, we may not have believed it or 
understood what it meant. What's tangible, and what  we can most easily relate to, is that we were 
having fun, and someone or something took us out of that fun and into pain. It wasn't our choice.  The 
cause of our pain came to us from the outside; therefore, whatever force acted upon us in that moment 
was to blame. We learned not only that feeling good can instantly be replaced with feeling bad through 
no fault of our own; we also learned about betrayal. We felt betrayed because many of these situations  
were completely unexpected or unanticipated, meaning, we were unprepared for how some people in 
our lives had the potential to behave. If their behavior caused us to flip into a state of emotional pain, 
then we quite naturally would have felt betrayed. 
As a side note, I feel it is important to say that many of our past, emotionally painful expe riences were 
the result of well-meaning parents, teachers and friends, many of whom were only doing w hat they 
K/^lie»i7QH of fho fimo ix7oc Vv^ct fcir nc Trip nn<;t pyamrtle is a child playing with a toy that is 
inherently dangerous. Take the toy away, and the ch ild will cry to express the emotional pain he is 
experiencing, and, if we are deali ng with a very young or immature ch ild, in all likelihood he will not 
listen to anything reasonable that we say about why he cannot play with that toy. 
But, at the same time, many people are born to immature and unreasonable parents, or encounter 
emotionally disturbed teachers, coaches, and employees who subconsciously or intentio nally inflict 
their personal problems on anyone they perceive as having less power. What's even worse is many of 
the people who have a tendency toward victimizing others are also clever enough to do it in a way that 
makes their victims believe they caused their own pain. In any case, whether our painful experien ces 
are the result of an act of love or  intentionally inflicted is somethin g each of us will have to determine 
for ourselves. The bottom line is that, as adults when we get into a trading m ode, we don't realize how 
natural it is to associate the instantaneous shift fro m joy to pain that we experienced so often as 
children with the same instantaneous shift from joy to pain that occurs when we trade. The implications 
are that if we haven't learned to accept the inherent risks of trading and don't know how to g uard 
against making these natural connections between our past and the present, we will end up blaming the 
market for our results instead of  taking responsibility for them. 
Even though most people who trade consider themselves responsible adults, only the very best traders 
have reached a point where they can and do accept complete responsibility for the outcome of any 
particular trade. Everyone else to  one degree or another assumes they  are taking responsibility; but the 
reality is that they want the market to do it for them. The typical trader wants the market to fulfill his 
expectations, his hopes, and dreams.  
Society may work this way but the markets certainly don't. In society, we can expect othe r people to 
behave in reasonable and responsible ways. When they don't, and if we suffer as a result, soci ety makes 
remedies available to rectify the imbalance and make us whole again. The market, on the other hand, 
has no responsibility to give us anything or do anything that would benefit us. This may  not be the way 
markets are advertised and certainly not the impression  they want to project, but the reality is, every 
trader who participates in the markets does so for his own benefit. The only way one trader can benefit 
is if some other trader loses, whether the loss is in actual dollars as in a futures trade, or lost 
opportunity as in a stock trade. When you put on a trade, it is in anticipation of making money.  Every 
other trader in the world who puts on a trade does so for the same reason. When you look at your 
relationship with the market from this perspective, you could say that your purpose is to extract money 
from the markets, but, by the same token, the market 's sole purpose is to extract money or opportunity 
from you. 
If the market is a group of people interacting to extract money from one another, then what is the 
market's responsibility to the individual trader? It ha s no responsibility other than to follow the rules it 
has established to facilitate this activity. The point is, if you have ever found yourself blaming the 
market or feeling betrayed, then you have not given enough consideration to the implications of w hat it 
means to play a zero-sum game. Any degree of blaming means you have not accepted the rea lity that 
the market owes you nothing, regardless of what you want or think or how much effort you put into 
your trading. 
In the market, typical social values of exchange do not come into play. If you don't unde rstand this and 
find a way to reconcile the differences between th e social norms you grew up with and the way the 
market works, you will continue to project your hop es, dreams, and desires onto the market believing 
it's going to do something for you. When it doesn't,  you'll feel angry, frustrated, emotionally distraught, 
and betrayed. 
Taking responsibility means acknowledging and accepting, at the deepest part of your identity, that 
you—not the market—are completely responsible for your  success or failure as a trader. Granted, the 
market's purpose is to separate you from your money; but in the process of doing s o, it also provides 
you with an endless stream of opportunities for you to take money from it. When prices move, that 
movement represents the collective actions of every one narticioating at that moment. The market also 
generates information about itself, and makes it extremely easy to enter and exit trades (depen ding, of 
course, on the number of people participating).  
From the individuals perspective, price movement, information, and the ability to enter and exit trade s 
represent opportunities to see something and to act on what you perceive. During ea ch moment the 
markets are open, you have an opportunity to enter a position, lighten up a position, add to a position,  
or exit a position. These are all opportunities to enrich  yourself by taking profits or, at least, cutting 
your losses. Let me pose a question. Do you feel  responsible for fulfilling some other traders 
expectations, hopes, dreams, and desires? Of course yo u don't. It sounds absurd to even ask. However, 
if you ever find yourself blaming the market and feeling betrayed, that is essentially what you are 
doing. You are expecting the collective actions of everiyone participating in the market to make the 
market act in a way that gives you what you want. You have to learn for yourself how to get what you 
want out of the markets. The first major step in this  learning process is taking complete and absolute 
responsibility. 
Taking responsibility means believing that all of your outcomes ar e self-generated; that your results are 
based on your interpretations of market information, the decisions you make and the actions you take 
as a result. Taking anything less than complete re sponsibility sets up two major psychological obstacles 
that will block your success.  
First, you will establish an adversarial relationship with the market that takes you out of the cons tant 
flow of opportunities. Second, you will mislead yourself into believing that your tr ading problems and 
lack of success can be rectified through market analysis. 
Let's consider the first obstacle. When you project any degree of responsibilit y onto the market for 
giving you money or cutting your losses, the market can all too easily take on the qu ality of an 
adversary or enemy. Losing (when you expected the market to do something different from what it  did) 
will tap you into the same childlike feelings of pain, anger, resentment, and powerlessness that  all of us 
felt when someone took something away from us, didn't give us what we  wanted, or wouldn't let us do 
what we wanted. 
No one likes to feel denied, especially if we believe  that getting what we want will make us happy. In 
each of these situations, something or someone outside of us prevented us from expressing ourselv es in 
some particular way. In other words, some outside force was acting against the inner force of our 
desires and expectations. As a result, it feels natural to assign the market the power of an outside force 
that either gives or takes away. But consider the fact that the market present s its information from a 
neutral perspective. That means the market doesn't know what you want or expect, nor does  it care, 
unless, of course, you trade the kind of position th at can have a major impact on prices. Otherwise, 
each moment, each bid, and each offer gives you the opportunity to do something. You can put on a 
trade, take profits, or take off a loser. This is also true for those of you who are floor traders and are  
personally known to other floor traders, who may also know your position and, to  your detriment, 
purposely take advantage of that knowledge. It just me ans that you have to be faster and more focused, 
or take whatever limitations you have in these areas into consideration and trade acco rdingly. 
From the market's perspective, each moment is neutral; to you, the observer, every mom ent and price 
change can have meaning. But where do these meaning exist? The meanings are based on wh at you've 
learned, and exist inside your mind, not in the mark et. The market doesn't attach meanings or interpret 
the information it generates about itself (although there are always individuals who will offer an 
interpretation if you're willing to listen). Furthe rmore, the market doesn't know how you define an 
opportunity or a loss. The market doesn't know whether you perceive it as an en dless stream of 
opportunities to enter and exit trades for both profits and losses at each and every moment, or whether 
you perceive it as a greedy monster ready and w illing in any given moment to devour your money. 
If you perceive the endless stream of opportunities to enter and exit trades without self-cr iticism and 
regret, then you will be in the best frame of mind to  act in your own best interest and learn from your 
experiences. On the other hand, if what you perceive  in market information is painful in some way, 
then you will naturally try to avoid that pain by either consciously or subconsciously blocki ng that 
information from your awareness. In the process of blocking that information, you'll systematically cut 
yourself off from any number of opportunities to enrich yourself. In  other words, you cut yourself off 
from the opportunity flow Furthermore, it will feel li ke the market is against you but only if you expect 
it to do something for you, or if you believe that it owes you something. If someone or some thing is 
against you and causes you pain, how are you likely to respond? You'll feel compelled to fight, but 
what exactly are you fighting? The market is certainly not fighting you. Yes, the market wants yo ur 
money, but it also provides you with  the opportunity to take as much as you can. Although it may feel 
as if you are fighting the market, or it is fighting you, the reality is you are simply fighting the negative 
consequences of not fully accepting that the market owes you nothing; and t hat you need to take 
advantage of the opportunities it presents by yourself, 100 percent and not one degree less. 
The way to take maximum advantage of a situation where you are being offered unlimited 
opportunities to do something for yourself is to get into the flow. The market does have a flow.  It is 
often erratic, especially in the shorter time frames, but it does display symmetrical patterns that repeat 
themselves over and over again. Obviously, it's a contradiction to flow with some thing you are against. 
If you want to start sensing the flow of the market, your mind has to be relatively free of fear, anger, 
regret, betrayal, despair, and disappointment.  
You won't have a reason to experience these negative emotions when you assume absolute 
responsibility. Earlier, I said that when you don't take responsibility, one of the major psychological 
obstacles that can block your success is that you will mislead yourself into believing that your trading 
problems and lack of consistency can be rectified through market analysis. To illustrate  this point, let's 
go back to our novice trader who started out with a carefree state of mind until he experienced his first 
loss. After winning with such ease and effortlessness, the abrupt shift to emotional pain can be q uite 
shocking—not shocking enough, however, to quit trading.  Besides, in his mind the situation wasn't his 
fault anyway; the market did it to him. Instead of quitting, the great feeling that he experienced when 
he was winning will be fresh in his mind, and will inspire him with a sense of determination to continue 
trading. 
Only now he's going to be smarter about it. He's going to put some effort into it and learn  everything he 
can about the markets. It's perfectly logical to think that if he can win not knowing an ything, he'll be 
able to clean up when he does know something. But th ere's a big problem here that very few, if any, 
traders will have any awareness of until long after the damage is done. Learning about the markets is 
fine and doesn't cause a problem in itself. It's the underlying reason for learning about the market that 
will ultimately prove to be his undoing. 
As I said a moment ago, the sudden shift from joy to pain usually creates quite a psychological shock. 
Very few people ever learn how to reconcile these kinds of experiences in a healthy way. 
Techniques are available, but they aren't widely know n. The typical response in most people, especially 
in the type of person attracted to trading, is revenge. For traders, the only way to extract that revenge is 
to conquer the market, and the only way to conquer the market is through market knowledge, or so they 
think. In other words, the underlying reason for why th e novice trader is learning about the market is to 
overcome the market, to prove something to it and himself, and most important, to prevent the m arket 
from hurting him again. He is not learning the market simply as a means to give himself a systematic  
way of winning, but rather as a way to either avoid pain or prove something that has absolutely nothing 
to do with looking at the market from an objective pe rspective. He doesn't realize it, but as soon as he 
made the assumption that knowing something about the market can prevent him from experiencing 
pain or can help satisfy his desire for revenge or to prove something, he sealed his fate to becom e a 
loser. 
In effect what he has done is set up an irreconcilable dilemma. 
He is learning how to recognize and understand the market's collective behavior patterns, and that's 
good. It even feels good. He's inspired because he assumes he's learning about the market in order to 
become a winner. As a result, he will typically go  on a knowledge quest, learning about trend lines, 
chart patterns, support and resistance, candlesticks, market profiles, point and line  charts, Elliott waves, 
Fibonacci retracements, oscillators, relative strength, stochastics, and many more technical tools too 
numerous to mention. 
Curiously, even though his knowledge has increased, he now finds that he's developed problems 
executing his trades. He hesitates, second guesses himsel f, or doesn't put on a trade at all, in spite of 
any number of clear signals to do so. It's all frustrating, even maddening, because what's happened 
doesn't make sense. He did what he was supposed to do—he learned—only to f ind that the more he 
learned, the less he took advantage of. He would never believe that he did anything wrong by devoting 
himself to learning; he simply did it for the wrong reasons. 
He won't be able to trade effectively if he is trying to prove something or anything for  that matter. If 
you have to win, if you have to be right, if you can't lose or can't be wrong, you will cause y ourself to 
define and perceive categories of market informatio n as painful. In other words, you will view as 
painful any information the market generates that  is in opposition to wh at will make you happy. 
The dilemma is that our minds are wired to avoid both physical and emotional pain, and learning  about 
the markets will not compensate for the negative effects our pain-avoidance mechanisms have on our 
trading. Everybody understands the nature of avoiding physical pain. Accidentally set your hand on a  
hot burner, and your hand moves away from the heat  automatically; its an instinctive reaction. 
However, when it comes to avoiding emotional pain and the negative consequences it creates, 
especially for traders, very few people understan d the dynamics. Its absolutely essential to your 
development that you understand these negative effects and learn how to take conscious control in a 
way that helps you fulfill your goals. 
Our minds have a number of ways to shield us from information that we have learned to perceive as 
painful. For example, at a conscious level, we can rationalize, justify, or make a case for staying in a 
losing trade. Some of the more typical ways we do  this are to call our trading buddies, talk to our 
broker, or look at indicators we never use, all for the express purpose of gathering nonpa inful 
information in order to deny the validity of the painful information. At a subconscious level,  our minds 
will automatically alter, distort, or specifically exclude information from our conscious awarenes s. In 
other words, we don't know at a conscious level that our pain-avoidance mechanisms are either 
excluding or altering the information being offered by the market. 
Consider the experience of being in a losing trade when the market is making consistentl y higher highs 
and higher lows or lower highs and lower lows against your position, while you refuse to ackn owledge 
you are in a losing trade because you have focused all your attention on the tics that go in yo ur favor. 
On the average, you are only getting one out of four or five tics in your direc tion; but it doesn't matter 
because every time you get one, you are convinced the market has reversed and is coming back . Instead 
the market keeps going against you. At  some point, the dollar value of the loss becomes so great that it 
cannot be denied and you finally exit the trade. The first reaction that traders universally have when 
looking back at such a trade is, "Why didn't I just take my loss and reverse?" 
The opportunity to put on a trade in the opposit e direction was easily re cognized once there was 
nothing at stake. But we were blinded to this opportunity while we were in the trade, because at that 
time the information indicating it was an opportunity was defined as painfu l, so we blocked it from our 
awareness.  
When our hypothetical trader first started trading, he was having fun; he was in a carefree state of 
mind; he had no personal agendas and nothing to prove. As long as he was winning, he put his trades 
on from a "let's see what will happen" perspective. The more he won, the less he considered the 
possibility of ever losing. When he finally did lose, he was probably in a state of mi nd where he least 
expected it. Instead of assuming that the cause of his pain was his erroneous expectation about what the 
market was supposed to do or not do, he blamed the market, and resolved that by gaining market 
knowledge, he could prevent such experiences from recurring. In other words, he made  a dramatic shift 
in his perspective from carefree to preventing pain by avoiding losses. 
The problem is that preventing pain by avoiding losses can't be done. The market generates behavior 
patterns and the patterns repeat themselves, but not every time. So again, there i s no possible way to 
avoid losing or being wrong. Our trader won't sense these trading realities, becau se he is being driven 
forward by two compelling forces: (1) he desperately wants that winning feeling ba ck, and (2) he is 
extremely enthusiastic about all of the market knowle dge he is acquiring. What he doesn't realize is 
that, in spite of his enthusiasm, when he went from a carefree state of mind to a prevent and-avoid mode 
of thinking, he shifted from a positive to a negative attitude. 
He's no longer focused on just winning, but rather on how he can avoid pain by preventing th e market 
from hurting him again. This kind of negative perspective isn't any diffe rent from the tennis player or 
golfer who is focused on trying not to make a mistake, the more he tries not to make a mistake, the 
more mistakes he makes. However, this mode of thinking is much easier to recognize in sports  because 
there's a more discemable connection between one's focus and one's results. With trading, the 
connection can be obscured and more  difficult to recognize as a resu lt of the positive feelings being 
generated from discovering new relationships in market data and behavior. 
Since he is feeling good, there's no reason to suspect that anything is wrong , except that the degree to 
which his focus is weighted toward pain-avoidance is the same degree by whic h he will create the very 
experiences he is trying to avoid. In other words, the more he has to win and not lose, the less t olerance 
he will have for any information that might indicate he is not getting what he wants. Th e mor 
information that he has the potential to block, the less he will be able to perceive an opportunity to act 
in his own best interests. 
Learning more and more about the markets only to  avoid pain will compound his problems because the 
more he learns, the more he will naturally expect from the markets, making it all the more  painful when 
the markets don't do their part. He has unwittingly created a vicious cycle where the more he learns, the 
more debilitated he becomes; the more debilitated he  becomes, the more he feel compelled to learn. 
The cycle will continue until he either quits trading in disgust or recognizes that the root cause of his 
trading problems is his perspective, not his lack of market knowledge. 
 
 
WINNERS, LOSERS, BOOMERS, AND BUSTERS 
 
It takes some time before most traders either thro w in the towel or find out the true source of their 
success. In the meantime, some traders manage to get enough right about trading to enter into what is 
commonly referred to as the "boom and bust cycle." 
Contrary to what some of you may have inferred from the example of the novice trader, not  everyone 
has an inherently negative attitude and is therefore doomed to lose consistently. Yes, it is tr ue that some 
traders do consistently lose, often until they lose ev erything or quit trading because they can't tolerate 
any more emotional pain. However, there are also many traders who are tenacious students of the 
market and have a sufficiently winning attitude go ing into trading so that, in spite of the many 
difficulties, they eventually learn how to make mone y. But, and I want to emphasize this, they learn 
how to make money only on a limited basis; they haven't yet learned how to counteract  the negative 
effects of euphoria or how to compensate  for the potential for self-sabotage. 
Euphoria and self-sabotage are two powerful psychological forces that will have an extremely negative 
effect on your bottom line. But, they are not forces you have to concern yourself with until you start 
winning, or start winning on a consistent basis, and that's a big problem. When you're winning, yo u are 
least likely to concern yourself with anything that might be a potential problem, especially something 
that feels as good as euphoria. One of the primary characteristics of euphoria is that it creates a sense of 
supreme confidence where the possibility of anyt hing going wrong is virtually inconceivable. 
Conversely, errors that result from self-sabotage have their root in any number of conflicts that trad ers 
have about deserving the money or deserving to win. It's when you're winning that you are most 
susceptible to making a mistake, overtrading, putting on too large a position, viola ting your rules, or 
generally operating as if no prudent boundaries on your behavior are necessary. You may ev en go to 
the extreme of thinking you are the market. However, the market rarely agrees, and when it disagrees, 
you'll get hurt. The loss and the emotional pain are usually significant. You will experie nce a boom, 
followed by the inevitable bust. 
If I were to classify traders based on the kind of results they achieve, I would put them into three broad 
categories. The smallest group, probably fewer than 10 percent of the active traders, are the consistent 
winners. They have a steadily rising equity curve with relatively minor drawdowns. The drawdowns 
they do experience are the type of normal losses that any trading methodology or system incurs. 
Not only have they learned how to make money, but they are no longer susceptible to the  psychological 
forces that cause the boomand-bust cycle. 
The next group, which consists of between 30 and 40 percent of the active traders, are consistent losers. 
Their equity curves are mirror images of the consistent winners' curves, but in the opposite direction—
many losing trades with an occasional winner. Regardless of how long they have been trading, there's 
much about it that they haven't learned. They eith er have illusions about the nature of trading or are 
addicted to it in ways that make it virtually impossible for them to be winners. 
The largest group, the remaining 40 to 50 percent of the active traders, are the "boom and bus ters." 
They have learned how to make money, but they haven't learned there s a whole body of trading skills 
that have to be mastered in order to keep the money they make. As a result, their equity c urves 
typically look like roller-coaster rides, with a nice, steady assent into a steep dropoff, then another nice, 
steady assent into another steep dropoff. The roller-coaster cycle continues on and on. 
I have worked with many experienced traders who have put together incredible winni ng streaks, 
sometimes going months without a losing day; having fifteen or twenty winning trades in a row is not 
unusual for them. But for the boom and busters, these streaks always end the same way—in huge losses 
that are the result of either euphoria or self-sabotage. 
If the losses are the result of euphoria, it really doesn't matter what form the streak takes—a number of 
wins in a row, a steadily rising equity curve, or even one winning trade. Everyone seems to have a 
different threshold for when overconfidence or euphoria starts to take hold of th e thinking process. 
However, the moment euphoria takes hold, the trader is in deep trouble. In a state of ov erconfidence or 
euphoria, you can't perceive any risk because euphoria makes you believe that absolutely nothing can 
go wrong. If nothing can go wrong, there's no need for rules or boundaries to govern your behavior. So  
putting on a larger than usual position is not only appealing, it's compelling. 
However, as soon as you put on the larger-than-usual position, you're in danger. The larger the 
position, the greater the financial impact small fluctuations in price will have on your equit y. Combine 
the largerthan- normal impact of a move against your pos ition with a resolute belief that the market will 
do exactly as you expect, and you have a situation in which one tic in the opposition direction of your 
trade can cause you to go into a state of "mind-freeze" and become immobilized. 
When you finally do pull yourself out of it, you'll be dazed, disillusioned, and betrayed, and you 'll 
wonder how something like that could have happened. In fact, you were betrayed by  your own 
emotions. However, if you're not aware of or don't understand the underlying dynamics I just 
described, you'll have no other choice but to blame the market. If you believe the market di d this to 
you, then you'll feel compelled to learn more about the market in order to protect yo urself. The more 
you learn, the more confident you will naturally become in your ability to win. As your confidence 
grows, the more likely that at so me point you will cross the threshold into euphoria and start the cycle 
all over again. 
Losses that result from self-sabotage can be just as damaging, but they're usually  more subtle in nature. 
Making errors like putting in a sell for a buy or vi ce versa, or indulging yourself in some distracting 
activity at the most inopportune time are typical examples of how traders make sure they don't win. 
Why wouldn't someone want to win? It's really not a question of what someone want s, because I 
believe that all traders want to win. Yet, there are often conflicts about winning. Sometimes these 
conflicts are so powerful that we find our behavior is in direct conflict with what we want. These 
conflicts could stem from religious upbringing, work ethic or certain types of childhood trauma. If 
these conflicts exist, it means that your mental environment is not completely aligned with your goals. 
In other words, not all parts of you would argue for the same outcome. Therefore, you can't assume that 
you have the capacity to give yourself an unlimited amount of money just because you have learned 
how to trade and the money is there for the taking. 
A futures broker at one of the major brokerage firms once commented that when it comes to his 
customers, he lives by the motto th at all commodity traders are terminal, and it is his job to keep them 
happy until they're gone. He said this  facetiously, but there is a lot of truth to his statement. Obviously, 
if you lose more money than you make, you can't survive. What's less obvious, and one of the 
mysteries of being successful, is that if you win, you may still be terminal; that is, if you win and you 
haven't learned how to create a healthy balance between confidence and restraint, or you haven' t 
learned how to recognize and compensate for any potential you have to self-destruct, you will soone r or 
later lose. 
If you are among those in the boom-and-bust cycle, consider this: If you could redo eve ry losing trade 
that was the result of an error or recklessness, how much money would you have now? Base d on these 
recalculated results, what would your equity curve look like? I'm sure many of  you would fall into the 
category of consistent winners. Now think about how you responded to your losses when they 
occurred. Did you assume complete responsibility for them? Did you try to identify ho w you might 
change your perspective, attitude, or behavior? Or did you look to the market and wonder what you 
might learn about it to prevent such a thing from happening again? Obviously, the market  has nothing 
to do with your potential for recklessness, nor does it have anything to do with the errors you  make as a 
result of some internal conflict about deserving the money.  
Probably one of the hardest concepts for traders to effectively assimilate is that the market doesn't  
create your attitude or state of mind; it simply acts as  a mirror reflecting what's inside back to you. If 
you are confident, it's not because the market is making you feel that way; it is because  your beliefs and 
attitudes are aligned in a way that allows you to step forward into an experience, take responsibility for 
the outcome, and extract the insight that's been made  available. You maintain your confident state of 
mind simply because you are constantly learning. Conversely, if you're angiy and afraid, it's beca use 
you believe to some degree that the market creates your outcomes, not the other way around. 
Ultimately, the worst consequence of not taking responsibility is that it keeps you in a cycle of pain and 
dissatisfaction. Think about it for a moment. If you're not responsible for your results, then you can 
assume there's nothing for you to learn, and you can stay exactly as you are.  
You won't grow and you won't change. As a result, you will perceive events in exactly the same way, 
and therefore respond to them in the same way, and get the same dissatisfying results. Or, you might 
also assume the solution to your problems is to gain more market knowledge. It is always virtuous to 
learn, but in this case if you don't take responsibility for your attitudes and perspective, then I vou're 
learninc* snmpfhinff valuaVilp fnr wrnnrr that will cause you to use what you've learned in 
inappropriate ways. Without realizing it, you'll be using your knowledge to avoid the responsibility of 
taking risks. In the process, you end up creating the veiy things you are trying to avoid, keeping you i n 
a cycle of pain and dissatisfaction. However, there is one tangible benefit to be gained f rom blaming 
the market for what you wanted and didn't get.  
You can temporarily shield yourself from your own harsh self-criticism. I say "temporar ily" because, 
when you shift responsib ility, you cut yourself o ff from whatever you needed to learn from the 
experience. Remember our definition of a winning a ttitude: a positive expectation of your efforts with 
an acceptance that whatever results you get are a perfect reflection of your level of developm ent and 
what you need to learn to do better. If you shift th e blame in order to block the painful feelings that 
result from beating yourself up, all you've done is put an infected Band-Aid on the wound. You may 
think you have solved the problem, but the problem is only going to resurface later , worse than before. 
It has to, simply because you haven't learned anything that would cause you to make the land of 
interpretations that would result in a more satisfying experience.  
Did you ever wonder why leaving money on the table is often more painful than taking a loss ? When 
we lose, there are any number of ways in which we can shift the blame to the market and not accept 
responsibility. But when we leave money on the table,  we can't blame the market. The market didn't do 
anything but give us exactly what we wanted, but for whatever reason, we weren't capable of acting on 
the opportunity appropriately. In other words, there's no way to rationalize the pain away. You are not 
responsible for what the market does or doesn't do, but you are responsible for everything else  that 
results from your trading activities. You are responsible for what you have learned, a s well as for 
everything you haven't learned yet that's waiting to be discovered by you. The most efficie nt path to 
discovering what you need to be successful is to develop a winning attitude, because it's an inherent ly 
creative Dersoective. Not onlv does a winnin? attitude onen vou un to what you need to learn; it also 
produces the land of mind-set that is most conducive to discovering something no one else has 
experienced. Developing a winning attitude is the key to your success. The problem fo r many traders is 
that either they think they already have one, when they don't, or th ey expect the market to develop the 
attitude for them by giving them winning trades. Y ou are responsible for developing your own winning 
attitude. The market is not going to do  it for you, and, I want to be as  emphatic as I can, no amount of 
market analysis will compensate for developing a winning attitude if you lack one.  
Understanding the markets will give you the edge you need to create some winning trades, but your 
edge won't make you a co nsistent winner if you don't have a winning attitude. Certainly one could 
argue that some traders lose because they don't understand enough about the markets and therefore they 
usually pick the wrong trades. As reasonable as this may sound, it has been my experienc e that traders 
with losing attitudes pick the wrong trades regardless of how much they know about the markets. In 
any case, the result is the same—they lose.  
On the other hand, traders with winning attitudes who know virtually nothing about the markets can 
pick winners; and if they know a lot about the markets, they can pick even more winners. If you want 
to change your experience of the markets from fearful to confident, if you want to change your results 
from an erratic equity curve to a steadily rising one, the first step is to embrace the responsibility and 
stop expecting the market to give you anything or do anything for you. If you reso lve from this point 
forward to do it all yourself, the market can no longer be your opponent. If you stop fighting the 
market, which in effect means you stop fighting yourself, you'll be amazed at how quickly yo u will 
recognize exactly what you need to learn, and how quickly you will learn it. Taking re sponsibility is 
the cornerstone of a winning attitude. CH

CHAPTER 4  
 
4 CONSISTENCY: A STATE OF MIND 
 
I hope that after reading the first three chapters you are getting die idea that just because you are acting 
in the capacity of a trader, doesn't mean that you've learned the appropriate ways to think about what 
you do. As I have already stressed several times, wh at separates the best traders from everyone else is 
not what they do or when they do it, but rather how they think about what they do and how they're 
thinking when they doit. If your goal is to trade like a professional and be a consistent wi nner, then you 
must start from the premise that the solutions are in  your mind and not in the market. Consistency is a 
state of mind diat has at its core certain fundamental thinking strategies that are unique  to trading. 
Experiencing a few or more winning trades can convince almost anyone that trading is easy. Recall 
your own experiences; think back to those trades that brought a stream of money flowing into your 
account when all you had done was make a simple decision to buy or sell.  
Now, combine the extremely positive feeling you ge t from winning and getting money with no effort, 
and it's almost impossible not to conclude that making money as a trader is easy. But if that's the c ase, 
if trading is so easy, then why is it so difficult to  master? Why are so many traders at their wits' end, 
grappling with the obvious contradiction? If it is true that trading is easy — and traders know it is 
because they've had the direct experience of how easy and effortless it is — then how can it also be 
possible that they can't make what they've learned about the markets work for them ove r and over 
again? In other words, how do we account for the contradiction between what we beli eve about trading 
and our actual trading results over time?  
 
THINKING ABOUT TRADING 
 
The answers are all in the way you think about it. The irony is that trading can be as much fun and as 
effortless as your experience of it has been on occasion; but experiencing these qu alities consistently is 
a function of your perspective, your beliefs, your attitudes, or your mindset.  
Choose the term you are most comfortable with; they all refer to the same thing : Winning and 
consistency are states of mind in the same way that happiness, having fun, and satisfaction are states of 
mind. Your state of mind is a by-pr oduct of your beliefs and attitudes. You can try to create consistency 
without having the appropriate beliefs and attitudes, bu t your results won't be a ny different than if you 
tiy to be happy when you're not having fun. When you're not having fun, it can be very diff icult to 
change your perspective to one where you, all of a sudden, start enjoying yourself. Of course , the 
circumstances of your situation could suddenly shift in a way that causes you t o experience joy. But 
then your state of mind would be the result of an external shift in conditions, not a r esult of an internal 
shift in your attitude. If you depend on outside co nditions and circumstances to make you happy (so 
that you always are enjoying yourself), then it is extremely unlikely that you will experience happiness 
on a consistent basis.  
However, you can greatly increase th e possibility of your being happy by  developing fun-type attitudes 
and, more specifically, by working on neutralizing the beliefs and attitudes that prevent you from 
having fun or enjoying yourself. Creating consistent success as a trader works the same way. You can't 
rely on the market to make you consistently successful, any more than you can rely on the outside 
world to make you consistently happy. People who are truly happy don't have to do an ything in order to 
be happy.  
They are happy people who do things. Traders who are consistently successful are c onsistent as a 
natural expression of who they are. They don't have to try to be consistent; they are con sistent. This 
may seem like an abstract distinction, but it is vitally important that you understand the difference. 
Being consistent is not something you can try to be, because the very act of trying will negate your 
intent by mentally taking you out of the opportunity  flow, making it less likely that you will win and 
more likely you will lose. Your veiy best trades were easy and effortless. You didn't have to try t o 
make them easy; they were easy. There was no struggle. You saw exactly what you needed  to see, and 
you acted on what you saw. You were in the moment , a part of the opportunity flow. When you're in 
the flow, you don't have to try, because everything you know about the market is av ailable to you. 
Nothing is being blocked or hidden from your awareness, and your actions seem effortless because  
there's no struggle or resistance. On the other hand, ha ving to try indicates that there is some degree of 
resistance or struggle. Otherwise, you would just be doing it and not have to try to be do ing it. It also 
indicates that you're trying to get what you want from the market. While it se ems natural to think this 
way, it's a perspective fraught with difficulties.  
The best traders stay in the flow because they don't try to get anything from the market; they si mply 
make themselves available so they can take advantage of whatever the market is offering at any given 
moment. There's a huge difference between the two perspectives.  
In Chapter 3, I briefly illustrated how our minds are wired to avoid both physical and emotional pain. If 
you trade from the perspective of trying to get what you want or what you expect from the  markets, 
what happens when the market doesn't behave in a way that will fulfill your expectations ? Your mental 
defense mechanisms kick in to compensate for the difference between what you want and what you're 
not getting, so that you don't experience any emotional pain.  
Our minds are designed to automatically block threatening information or find a way to obscure that 
information, in order to shield us  from the emotional discomfort we naturally feel when we don't get 
what we want. You won't realize it in the moment, but you will pick and choose inform ation that is 
consistent with what you expect, so that you can maintain a pain-free state of mind.  
However, in the process of trying to maintain a pain-free state of mind, you also take yourself out of  
the opportunity flow and enter the realm of the "could have," the "should have," the "would have," and 
the "if only." Everything that you could have, should have, or would have reco gnized in the moment 
appeared invisible, then all becomes painfully evident after the fact, after the opportunity is long gone. 
To be consistent, you have to learn to think about trading in such a way that you' re no longer 
susceptible to conscious or subconscious mental processes that cause you to obscure, block, or pick and 
choose information on the basis of what will make you happy, give you what you want, or avoid pa in. 
The threat of pain generates fear, and fear is the source of 95 percent of the errors  you are likely to 
make. Certainly, you can't be consistent or experience the flow if you're consistently making err ors, and 
you will make errors, as long as you're afraid that  what you want or what you expect won't happen. 
Furthermore, everything you attempt to do as a trader  will be a struggle, and it  will seem as if you are 
struggling against the market or that the market is against you personally. But, the reality  is that it's all 
taking place inside your mind. The market doesn't perceive the information it makes availabl e; you do. 
If there's a struggle, it is you who are struggling against your own TV^^oT*n 11 T-acic^onoo /">r^T-
iTlir»l-c anri r^avc  
Now, you may be asking yourself, how can I think about  trading in such a way that I'm no longer afraid 
and, therefore, no longer susceptible to the mental processes that cause me to block , obscure, or pick 
and choose information? The answer is: Learn to accept the risk.  
 
REALLY UNDERSTANDING RISK 
 
Other than the many issues surro unding responsibility that  we discussed in Chapter 3, there isn't 
anything about trading that is more central to your success and also more misunderstood than the 
concept of accepting the risk. As I mentioned in the first chapter, most trader s erroneously assume that 
because they are engaged in the inherently risky activity of putting on and taking off  trades, they are 
also accepting that risk. I will repeat that this assumption couldn't be further from the truth.  
Accepting the risk means accepting the consequences of your trades without emotional disc omfort or 
fear. This means that you must learn how to think about trading and your relationship with the  markets 
in such a way that the possibility of being wrong, losing, missing out, or lea ving money on the table 
doesn't cause your mental defense mechanisms to kick in and take you out of th e opportunity flow. It 
doesn't do you any good to take the risk of putting on a trade if you are afraid of th e consequences, 
because your fears will act on your perception of information and your behavior in a way that will  
cause you to create the very experience you fear the most, the one you are trying to avoid. I am  offering 
you a specific thinking strategy composed of a set of beliefs that will keep you focu sed, in the moment, 
and in the flow. With this perspective, you will not be trying to get anything from the market or to 
avoid anything. Rather, you will let the market unfol d and you will make yourself available to take 
advantage of whatever situations you define as opportunities. When you make yourself available to 
take advantage of an opportunity, you don't impose any limitations or expectations on t he market’s 
behaviour. You are satisfied to let the market do whatever it's going to do.  
However, in the process of doing something, the market will create certain condi tions you define and 
perceive as opportunities. You act on those opportunities to the best of your ability, but your state of 
mind is not dependent upon or affected by the market's behavior. If you can learn to crea te a state of 
mind that is not affected by the market's behavior , the struggle will cease to exist. When the internal 
struggle ends, everything becomes easy. At that point, you can take full advantage of a ll your skills, 
analytical or otherwise, to eventually realize your potential as a trader. Here's the challenge! How do 
you accept the risks of trading without emotional discomfort and fear, when at the moment yo u 
perceive the risk, you simultaneously feel discomfort and fear? In other words, how do you  remain 
confident and pain-free when you are absolutely certain you can be proved wrong, lose mon ey, miss 
out, or leave money on the table?  
As you can see, your fear and feeling of discomfort are completely justified and rational. E ach of those 
possibilities becomes real the moment you contemplate interacting with the market. Howe ver, as true 
as all of these possibilities are for every trader, what isn't true or the same for every trader is what it 
means to be wrong, lose, miss out, or leave money on the table. Not everyone shares the same beliefs 
and attitudes about these possibilities and, therefore,  we don't share the same emotional sensitivities. In 
other words, not everyone is afraid of the same things.  
This may seem obvious, but I assure you it is not. When we're afraid, the emotio nal discomfort we feel 
in the moment is so real that it's beyond question, and it's natural to assume that everyone shares ou r 
reality. I will give you a perfect example of what I am talking about. I recently  worked with  a trader, 
who was deathly afraid of snakes. As far as he was concerned, he had always been afraid of snakes  
because he couldn't recall a time when he wasn't. Now he is married and has a t hree-year-old daughter. 
One evening, while his wife was out of town, his daughter and he were invited to a frie nd's house for 
dinner. Unbeknownst to my client, his friends child had a pet snake.  
When the friends child brought out the snake for everyone to see, my client freaked and practically 
leapt to the other side of the room to get as far away from the snake as possible. His da ughter, on the 
other hand, was completely enthralled with the snake,  and wouldn't leave it alon e. When he related this 
story to me, he said that he was not only shocked by the unexpected confrontation w ith the snake, but 
that he was just as shocked by his daughter's reaction. She wasn't afraid and he assumed that sh e would 
be. I explained to him that his fear was so intense and his attachment to his daughter was so great that it 
was inconceivable to him that his daughter would not automatically share his reality about snakes. Bu t 
then I pointed out, there really wasn't any way she could have shared his experience, unless he 
specifically taught her to be afraid of snakes or she had had her own painful frightening experience. 
Otherwise, without anything to the contrary in her mental system, the most likely reaction to her first 
encounter with a living snake would be  pure, unadulterated fascination.  
Just as my client assumed that his daughter would be afraid of snakes, most traders assume the best 
traders, like themselves, are also afraid of being wrong, losing, missing out, and leaving money on the 
table. They assume that the best traders somehow neutralize their fears with  an inordinate amount of 
courage, nerves of steel, and self-control.  
Like many other things about trading, what seems to make sense, just isn't the case. Certainl y, any one 
or all of these characteristics may be present in any top trader. But what is not true is that these 
characteristics play any role in their superior performance. Needing courage, nerves of steel , or self-
control would imply an internal conflict where one fo rce is being used to counteract the effects of 
another. Any degree of stru ggle, trying, or fear associated with trading will take you out of the moment 
and flow and, therefore, diminish your results. This is where professional traders really separate 
themselves from the crowd. When you accept the risk the way the pros do, you won't p erceive anything 
that the market can do as threatening. If nothing is  threatening, there's nothing to fear. If you're not 
afraid, you don't need courage. If you're not stressed, why would you need nerves of steel ? And if 
you're not afraid of your potential to get reckle ss, because you have the appropriate monitoring 
mechanisms in place, then you have no need for self-control.  
As you contemplate the implications of what I am saying, I want you to keep something in mind:  Very 
few people who go into trading start out with the appropriate beliefs and attitudes about respons ibility 
and risk. There are some who do but it's rare. Everyone else goes through the same cycle  I described in 
the example of the novice trader: We start out carefre e, then become scared, and our fears continually 
diminish our potential. The traders who break through the cycle and ultimately make it are the ones 
who eventually learn to stop avoiding and star t embracing the responsibility and the risk.  
Most of those who successfully break the cycle don't make the shift in thinking until they hav e 
experienced so much pain from large losses that it has the positive effect of stripping away their 
illusions about the nature of trading. With respect to your development, the how of their transformation 
is not that important, because in most cases it happ ened inadvertently. In other words, they weren't 
completely aware of the shifts that were taking place inside their mental environment  until they 
experienced the positive effects their new perspective had on the ways in which they interacted with the 
market. This is why very few top traders can really explain what accounts for their success, except to 
speak in axioms like "cut your losses" and "go with the flow."  
What is important is that you understand it is comple tely possible to think the way the professionals do 
and to trade without fear, even though your direct experience as a trader would argue otherwise.  
 
 
 
ALIGNING YOUR MENTAL ENVIRONMENT 
 
Now we're going to start zeroing in on exactly how you can align your mental envir onment in order to 
accept the risk and function like a professional trader. Most of what I've discussed up to this point was 
designed to get you ready to do the real work. I'm going to teach you a thinking strateg y that has, at its 
core, a firm belief in probabilities and edges.  
With this new thinking strategy, you'll learn how to create a new relationship with the market, one t hat 
disassociates your trading from what it typically means to be wrong or to lose, and that prec ludes you 
from perceiving anything about the market as threatenin g. When the threat of pa in is gone, the fear will 
correspondingly disappear, as will the fear-based errors you are suscepti ble to. You will be left with a 
mind that is free to see what is available and to ac t on what you see. Getting to this carefree, fearless 
state of mind, in spite of being burned over and over again, will take some work, but it's not going to be 
so difficult as you may think. In fact, by the time yo u've finished reading this book, most of you will be 
amazed at how simple the solutions to your problems  really are. In many respects, a state of mind or 
perspective is like software code.  
You could have several thousand lines of perfectly written code, with only one flawed li ne, and in that 
one flawed line there might be only one character out of place. Depending on the pu rpose of the 
software and where that flaw is in relation to everything else, that one misplaced character could ruin 
the performance of an otherwise perfectly written system. You see, the solution was simp le: Fix the 
misplaced character, and everything runs smoothly. However, finding the error or even knowing it 
exists in the first place can take considerable expertise.  
When it comes to the ideal trading mentality, everybody is a certain psychological distance away. In 
other words, virtually everyone starts out with flawed software code. I use terms like clicks or degrees 
to indicate psychological distance  but these terms don't imply a specific distance. So, for example, 
many of you will find that you are only, let's say,  one click away in perspective from the ideal mind-
set. That one click could represent one or two erroneous or misplaced assumptions you ha ve about the 
nature of trading. As you reflect upon some of the ideas presented in this book, your perspective may 
shift.  
To use the analogy of software code, that shift would be equivalent to finding the flaw ed line in your 
mental system and replacing it with something that wo rks properly. People normally describe this kind 
of internal mental shift as an "ah, ha" experience, or the moment when the li ght goes on. Everyone has 
had these kinds of experiences, and there are some common qualities associated with them. Fi rst, we 
usually feel different. The world even seems different, as if it had suddenly change d. Typically, we 
might say at the moment of the breakthrough something like, "Why didn't you tell me this before?" or, 
"It was right in front of me the whole time, but I just didn't see it" or, "It's so simple; why couldn't I see 
it?"  
Another interesting phenomenon of the "ah, ha" experience, is that sometimes within mo ments, 
although the amount of time can vary, we feel as if this new part of our identity has al ways been a part 
of who we are. It then becomes difficult to believe that we were ever the way we were before we had 
the experience. In short, you may already have some  awareness of much of what you need to know to 
be a consistently successful trader. But being aware of something doesn't automatically make it a 
functional part of who you are. Awareness is not necessarily a belief. You can't assume that learning 
about something new and agreeing with it is the same as believing it at a level where you can act on it. 
Take the example of my client who is afraid of snakes. He is certainly aware that not all snakes are 
dangerous, and that learning how to make a distinction between the ones that are dangerous and the 
ones that aren't would not be difficult.  
Will learning how to make these distinctions sudden ly cause him not to be afraid of "non-dangerous 
snakes"? Can we assume that his awareness will drop down to a level in his mental environment where 
he can now interact with snakes without fear or im mobility? No, we cannot make this assumption. His 
awareness that some snakes aren't dangerous and his fear of snakes can exist side by side in his mental 
environment, as a contradiction to each other. You could confront him with a snake and he might 
readily acknowledge that he knows the snake is not dangerous and wouldn't hurt him;  but, at the same 
time, he would still find it extremely difficult to touc h the snake, even if he wanted to. Does this mean 
that he is doomed to be afraid of snakes for the rest  of his life? Only if he wants to be. It's really a 
matter of willingness.  
It's certainly possible to neutralize his fear, but he will have to work at it, and working at anythin g 
requires sufficient motivation. Many of us have what we know to be irrational fea rs and simply choose 
to live with the contradiction because we don't want to go through the emotional work that is necessary 
to overcome the fear. In this example, the contradiction is obvious. However, in my many years of 
working with traders, I have uncovered several typical contradictions and conflicts surrounding the 
issues of risk and responsibility, where holding two or more conflicting beliefs can easily can cel out 
your positive intentions, no matter how motivated you are to be successful.  
The problem is that none of these contradictions are really obvious, at least not at first glance. 
Contradictory beliefs, however, aren't the only problems.  What about assertions like "I'm a risk taker," 
that traders typically assume have dropped down to the functional level of a belief when, in fact, the 
underlying dynamics of the way they perceive the market indicates they are doing everything possible 
to avoid risk. Contradictory beliefs and nonfunctional awareness represent flawed mental software 
code; code that destroys your ability to stay focused and accomplish your go als; code that makes it 
seem as if you simultaneous ly have one foot on the accelerator an d the other on the brake; code that 
gives learning how to trade a mysterious quality that  will be challenging in a fun way at first, but 
usually turns into pure, unadulterated exasperation. When I was in college in the late  1960s, one of my 
favorite movies was Cool Hand Luke, starring Paul Newman. It was a very popular movie back then, so 
I'm sure some of you have seen it on late-night TV.  
Luke was in a Georgia chain gang. After he escaped and was caught for the second time, the warden 
and guards were determined not to let Luke make fool s of them a third time. So while forcing him to do 
an inordinate amount of work with no rest and giving him intermittent beatings, they kept asking, 
"Have you got your mind right yet, Luke?" Eventually , after considerable suffering, Luke finally told 
the prison bosses that he had his mind right. They said that if he didn't, and tried  to escape again, they'd 
kill him for sure. Of course, Luke attempted another escape, and true to their word, the guards killed 
him. Like Luke, many traders, whether they realize it or not, are trying to have it their way by be ating 
the market; as a result, they get financially and em otionally killed. There are easier, infinitely more 
satisfying ways of getting what you want from the market, but first you have to be willin g to "get your 
mind right." CHAPTER 5  
 
CHAPTER 5  
 
THE DYNAMICS OF PERCEPTION 
 
One of the primary objectives of this book is to teach you how to take the threat of pain out of market 
information. The market doesn't generate happy or painful information. From the markets pe rspective, 
it's all simply information. It may seem as if the market is causing you to feel the way you do at any 
given moment, but that's not the case. It's your own mental framework that determines ho w you 
perceive the information, how you feel, and, as a result, whether or not you are in the most conducive 
state of mind to spontaneously enter the flow and take advantage of whatever the market is offering.  
Professionals don't perceive anything about the markets as painful; therefore, no thr eat exists for them. 
If there's no threat, there's nothing to defend against. As a result, there isn't any reason for the ir 
conscious or subconscious defense mechanisms to kick in. That's why professional s can see and do 
things that mystify everyone else. They're in the flow, because they're perceiving an endless stre am of 
opportunities, and when they're not in the flow, the very best of the best can recognize that fact and 
then compensate by either scaling back or not trading at all.  
If your goal is to be able to trade like the professionals, you must be able to see the market from an  
objective perspective, without distortion. You must be  able to act without resistance or hesitation, but 
with the appropriate amount of positive restraint to counteract the negative effects of overconfidence or 
euphoria. In essence, your objective is to be able to create a un ique state of mind, a traders mentality. 
When you've accomplished this, everything else about your success as a trader will  fall into place. To 
help you achieve that objective, I'm going to give you a way to redefine your relationship to ma rket 
information so that there will be little or no potential to perceive any of it as threatening.  
By "redefine," I mean to change your perspective and operate out of a mental fram ework that keeps 
you focused on the opportunities available instead of tapping you into emotional pain.  
 
DEBUGGING YOUR MENTAL SOFTWARE 
 
In other words, we want to get the bugs out of our mental software code and get our minds rig ht. Doing 
this effectively will require an understanding of the nature of mental energy and how you can use that 
energy to change a perspective that is generating an unwanted, negative, emotional response t o market 
information. There's much to learn, but I think you will be amazed at how some simple change s can 
make a huge difference in your trading results. The process of trading starts with perceiving an 
opportunity. Without the perception of an opportunity, we wouldn't have a reason to trade. So I think it 
is only fitting that we start our examination of mental energy by breaking down the process of 
perception.  
What are the underlying dynamics of perception? What factors determine how we perceive information 
or what we perceive in relationship to what is av ailable? How is perception connected with what we 
experience at any given moment? Probably the easie st way to understand the dynamics of perception 
and answer these questions is to think of everything (and I do tion of forces—forces that generate 
information about the properties, characteristics, and traits that make them uniquely what they are . 
Everything that exists outside of our bodies—all plants and all categories of life; all planetary 
phenomena in the form of weather conditions, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions; all a ctive and inert 
physical matter; and all noncorporeal phenomena such as light, sound waves, microwaves, and 
radiation—generates information about the nature of its existence. That information has the potential to 
act as a force on one of our five physical senses. Be fore we go any further, notice that I use the verb 
"generate" in an all-inclusive way implying that everything is in an active state of expression, includ ing 
inanimate objects.  
To illustrate why I do that, let's look at something as simple as a rock. It's an inanimate object, 
composed of unique atoms and molecules expressing themselves as a rock. I can use the ac tive verb 
"expressing" because the atoms and molecules that make up the rock are in constant motion. So, even 
though the rock doesn't appear active except in the most abstract sense, it has characteristics and 
properties that will act as forces on our senses, causing us to experience and make distinctions about 
the nature of its existence. For example, a rock has texture, and that texture acts as a force on our sense 
of touch if we run our fingers across the rock's surface.  
A rock has shape and color, which act as a force on our vision; the rock takes up space tha t no other 
object can occupy, so that we see it instead of an empty space or some other object. A rock can also 
have an odor that acts as a force on our sense of smell, or taste like something, although I haven't licked 
any rocks lately to find out. When we encounter anything in the environment that expres ses its 
properties and characteristics, an exchange of energy takes place. Energy from the outside, in the form 
of whatever is expressing itself, gets transformed by our nervous system into electrical impulse s and 
then gets stored in our inner, mental environment. To be more specific, whatever we are seeing, 
hearing, tasting, smelling, or feeling through our senses gets transformed into electrical impulses of 
energy and stored in our mental environment as a memory and/or dis- I think all of this is fairly self-
evident to most people, but there are some profound implications here that aren't self-evident, and we 
typically take them comp letely for granted.  
First of all, there's a cause-and-effe ct relationship that exists between ourselves and everything else that 
exists in the external environment. As a result, our encounters with external forces create what I am 
going to call "energy structures" inside our minds. The memories, distinctions, and, ultimately, the 
beliefs we acquire throughout our lives exist in our mental environment in the form of str uctured 
energy. Structured energy is an abstract concept. You might be asking yourself , "How does energy take 
shape or form?" Before I answer this question, an even more fundamental question needs to be 
addressed.  
How do we know that memories, distinctions, and beliefs exist in the form of energy in the first place? 
I don't know if it's been scientifically proven or completely accepted by the scientific c ommunity, but 
ask yourself in what other form could these mental components exist? Here's what we know fo r sure: 
Anything composed of atoms and molecules takes up space and, therefore, can be observed. If 
memories, distinctions, and beliefs existed in some physical form, then we should be able to observe 
them. To my knowledge, no such observations have been made.  
The scientific community has dissected brain tissue (both living and dead) examined it at the level of 
the individual atom, mapped various regions of the brain in terms of their functions,  but nobody, as yet, 
has observed a memory, distinction, or belief in its natural form. By "in its natural form" I mean that 
although a scientist can observe the individual brain cells that contain certain memories , he can't 
experience those memories first hand. He can only experience them if the person to whom the 
memories belong is alive and chooses to express th em in some way. If memories, distinctions, and 
beliefs don't exist as physical matter, then there really isn't any alternative way for them to exist except 
as some form of energy. If this is in fact the case, can this energy take on a specific shape? Can  it be 
structured in a way that reflects the external forc es that caused it to come into existence? Most 
definitely! Is there anvthing in the environment that is analogous to energy having shape  
Thoughts are energy. Because you think in a language, your thoughts are structured by the limitation s 
and rules that govern the particular language in which you think. When you express th ose thoughts 
aloud, you create sound waves, whic h are a form of energy. The sound waves created by the interaction 
of your vocal cords and tongue are structured by the content of your message. Microwaves ar e energy. 
Many phone calls are relayed by microwaves, which means that the microwave energy has to be 
structured in a way that reflects the message it is carrying.  
Laser light is energy, and if you've ever witnessed a demonstration of a laser light show, or laser art, 
what you've seen is pure energy taking a shape that reflects the creative desires of the artists. All of 
these are good examples of how energy can take shap e, form, and structure. Of course, there are many 
more, but there is one more example that illustrates the point in the most graphic way. At the most 
fundamental level, what are dreams? I am not aski ng you what dreams mean or what you think their 
purpose is, but rather, what are they? What are their properties? If we assume that dreams take  place 
within the confines of our skulls, then they can't be composed of atoms and molecules, because there 
wouldn't be enough space for all of the things that exist and take place in our dreams. Dream 
experiences seem to have the same proportions and dimensions as the things we perceive when we are 
awake and experiencing life through our five senses.  
The only way this could be possible is if dreams were a form of structured energy, because energy can 
take on any size or dimension, but, in doing so, doesn't actually take up any sp ace. Now, if it hasn't 
already occurred to you, there's something here that's really profound. If the memories, distinctions , 
and beliefs we've acquired as a result of our encounters with the external environment represe nt what 
we've learned about that environment and how it works; and if these memories, distinctions, and beliefs 
exist in our mental environment as energy; and if en ergy doesn't take up any space; then it also could 
be said that we have an unlimited capacity for learning.  
Well, not only do I think it could be said, I'm saying it. Consider the developm ent of human 
consciousness and what to know to function effectively compared to just 100 years ago. There is 
absolutely nothing to indicate that we don't have an unlimited capacity to learn. The difference between 
what we are aware of now and what we can do as a result of this expanded awareness would boggle the 
mind of anyone living 100 years ago.  
 
PERCEPTION AND LEARNING 
 
However, we must be careful not to equate storage capacity with learning capacity. Learning, and 
becoming aware of what is available to be learned, is not just a function of storag e capacity. If it were, 
then what would stop us from knowing everything? And if we knew everything, the n what would stop 
us from perceiving every possible characteristic, property, or trait of everything that is expressing itself 
in any given moment? What stops us now? These questions get to the very heart of why you have to 
understand that mental components like memories, distinctions, and beliefs exist as ener gy. Anything 
that is energy has the potential to act as a force expressing its form, and that is exactly what our 
memories, distinctions and beliefs do.  
They act as a force on our senses from the inside, expressing their form and content, and, in the process 
of doing so, they have a profoundly limiting effect on the information we perce ive in any given 
moment, making much of the information that is available from the environment's  perspective, and the 
possibilities inherent within that information, literally invisible.  
I am saying here that, in any given moment the environment is generating an enormous amount of  
information about its properties, ch aracteristics, and traits. Some of that information is beyond the 
physiological range of our senses. For example, our eyes can't see every wavele ngth of light nor can 
our ears hear every frequency of sound the environment produces, so there's defi nitely a range of 
information that is beyond the physiological capabilities of our senses. What about the rest of the 
information the environment is generating about itself ? Do we see, hear, taste, smell, or feel through 
our senses every possible distinction, trait, and characteristic being senses? Absolutely not! The energy 
that's inside of us will categorically limit and bl ock our awareness of much of this information by 
working through the same sensory mechanisms the external environment works thro ugh. Now, if you 
take a moment and think about it, some of what I ju st said should be self-evident. For example, there 
are many ways in which the external environment can express itself that we don't perceive si mply 
because we haven't learned about them yet.  
This is easy to illustrate. Think back to the first time you ever looked at a price chart. What did yo u 
see? Exactly what did you perceive? With no previous exposure, I'm sure, like eve ryone else, you saw 
a bunch of lines that had no meaning. Now if you're like most traders, when you look at a price chart 
you see characteristics, traits, and behavior patter ns that represent the collective actions of all the 
traders who participated in those particular trades. Initially, the chart represented undifferentiated 
information. Undifferentiated information usually creates a state of confusion, and that's probably what 
you experienced when you first encountered a chart.  
Gradually, however, you learned to ma ke distinctions about that information, such as trends and trend 
lines, consolidations, support and resistance, retracements or significant relationships between volu me, 
and open interest and price action, just to name a few. You learned that each of these distinct ions in the 
market s behavior represented an opportunity to fulfill some personal need , goal, or desire. Each 
distinction now had a meaning and some relative degree of significance or importance attached to it. 
Now, I want you to use your imagination and pretend that I just set before you the very first pr ice chart 
you ever saw. Would there be a difference between what you see now and what you saw then ? 
Absolutely. Instead of a bunch of undifferentiated lines, you would see everything  you've learned about 
those lines between then and now. In other words, you would see all the distinctions you've lea rned to 
make, as well as all the opportunities those distinctions represent.  
Yet, everything you can see as you look at that chart now existed then, and, furthermore, was available 
to be perceived. What's the difference? The structured energy that's inside of you no w—the knowledge 
you have gained—acts as a force on your eyes, causing you to recognize the various distinctions that 
you've learned about. Since that energy wasn't there the first time you looked at the chart, all the 
opportunities that you now see were there, but at the same time invisible to you. Furthe rmore, unless 
you've learned to make every possible distinction based on every possible relationship between the 
variables in that chart, what you have n't learned yet is still invisible. Most of us have no concept of the 
extent to which we are continually surrounded by the invisible opportunities inherent in the information 
we're exposed to.  
More often than not, we never learn about these oppor tunities and, as a result, they remain invisible. 
The problem, of course, is that unless we're in a completely new or unique situation or we 're operating 
out of an attitude of genuine openness, we won't perceive something that we haven't learned about yet. 
To learn about something, we have to be able to experience it in some way. So what we hav e here is a 
closed loop that prevents us from learning. Perceptual closed loops exist in all of us, because they are 
natural functions of the way mental energy expresses itself on our senses. Eveiyone ha s heard the 
expression, "People see what they want to see."  
I would put it a little differently: People see what they've learned to see, and everythin g else is invisible 
until they learn how to counteract the energy that blocks their awareness of whatever is unlearned and 
waiting to be discovered. To illustrate this concept and make it even clearer, I am going to give you 
another example, one that demonstrates how mental energy can affect how we perceive and experience 
the environment in a way that it actually reverses the cause-and-effect relationship. Let's look at a very 
young child's first encounter with a dog. Because it's a first-time experience, the child's mental 
environment is a clean slate, so to speak, with respect to dogs. He won't have any memories and 
certainly no distinctions about a dog's nature. Therefore, up to the moment of his first encounter, from 
the child's perspective, dogs don't exist. Of course, from the environment's perspective, dogs do  exist 
and they have the potential to act as a force on the child's senses to create an experience. In othe r 
words, dogs expressing their nature can act as a cause to produce an effect inside the child's mental 
environment. What kind of effect are dogs ca pable of producing? Well, dogs have a range of 
expression. By range of expression I mean dogs can behave in a number of ways toward humans.  
They can be friendly, loving, protective, and fun to play with; or they can be hostile, mean, and 
dangerous—just to name a few of the many behaviors they're capable of. All of thes e traits can be 
observed, experienced, and learned about. When th e child sees the dog for the first time, there is 
absolutely nothing in his mental environment to tell  him what he is dealing with. Unfamiliar, unknown, 
and unclassified environmental information can genera te a sense of curiosity—when we want to find 
out more about what we're experiencing—or it can generate a state of confusion,  which can easily turn 
to fear if we can't place the information into an understandable or meaningful organiz ational 
framework or context. In our example, the child's sense of curiosity kicks in and he ru shes to the dog to 
get more sensory experience.  
Notice how children are literally compelled to thru st themselves into a si tuation they know nothing 
about. However, in this example, the environmental forces at hand do not react favorably to the child's 
advances. The dog the child is interested in is either inherently mean or having a bad day. In any case, 
as soon as the child gets close enough, the dog bites him. The attack is so severe that the dog has to be 
pulled off the child. This kind of unfortunate experience is certainly not typical, but it's not that 
uncommon either. I chose it for two reasons: First, most people can relate to it in s ome way either from 
their own direct experience or through the experience of someone they know. Second, as we analyze 
the underlying dynamics of this experience from an energy perspective, we're going to learn about  
1) how our minds are designed to think,  
2) process information,  
3) how these processes affect what we experience and  
4) our ability to recognize  new possibilities.  
I know this mav seem like a lot of insieht from iust one example, but the principles invo lved apply to 
the dynamics beneath virtually all learning. As a result of being physically and emotionally 
traumatized, the little boy in our example now has a memory and one distinction about the way dogs 
can express themselves.  
If the boys ability to remember his experiences is normal, he can store this incident in a way that  
represents all of the senses the experience had an impact on: For example the attack can be stor ed as 
mental images based on what he saw, as well as mental sounds representing what he heard, and so on. 
Memories representing the other three senses will work the same way.  
However, the kind of sensory data in his memory is not as important as the kind of ener gy the sensory 
data represents. We basically have two kinds of mental energy: positively charged energy, w hich we 
call love, confidence, happiness, joy, satisfaction, excitement, and enthusiasm, to name a few of the 
pleasant ways we can feel; and negatively charged energy, representing fear, terror, dissatisfaction, 
betrayal, regret, anger, confusion, anxiety, stress, and frustration, all represe nting what is commonly 
referred to as emotional pain. Because the boy's fi rst experience with a dog was intensely painful, we 
can assume that regardless of what senses were affected, all of his memories of this experience  will be 
in painful, unpleasantfeeling, negative energy.  
Now, what effect will this negatively charged mental energy have on his perception an d behavior if and 
when he encounters another dog? The answer is so obvious that it may seem ridiculous even to ask, but 
the underlying implications are no t obvious, so bear with me. Clearly, the moment he comes into 
contact with another dog, he will e xperience fear. Notice that I used the word "another" to describe the 
next dog he has any contact with. Wh at I want to point out is that any dog can cause the boy to feel 
fear, not just the one that actually attacked him. It  won't make a bit of difference if the next dog he 
comes into contact with is the friendliest dog in the world, one whose nature is only to express 
playfulness and love. The child will still be afraid, and furthermore, his fear could  quickly turn to 
unrestrained terror especially if the second dog (seeing a child and wanting to play) at tempts to 
approach him. Each of us has at one time or another witnessed a situation in which someone was 
experiencing fear, when from our perspective there wasn't the least bit of danger or threat. Although we  
may not have said it, we probably thought to ourse lves that this person was being irrational.  
 
PERCEPTION AND RISK 
 
If we tried to point out why there was no need to be afraid, we probably found that our  words had little, 
if any, impact. We could easily think the same thing about the boy in our example, that he is just being 
irrational, because it's clear from our perspective that  other possibilities exist than the one his mind has 
focused on. But is his fear any less rational than, let's say, your fear (or hesi tation) about putting on the 
next trade, when your last trade was a loser?  
Using the same logic, a top trader would say that your fear is irrational because this "now mome nt" 
opportunity has absolutely nothing to do with your last trade. Each trade is simply an edge with a 
probable outcome, and statistically independent of every other trade. If you believ e otherwise, then I 
can see why you're afraid; but I can assure you that your fears are completely u nfounded. As you can 
see, one person's perception of risk can easily be perceived as irrational thinking by another. Risk is 
relative, but to the person who perceives it in the moment, it seems absolute and beyond q uestion. 
When the child encountered his first dog, he was bubbling with excitement and curiosity. Wh at is it 
about the way our minds think and process information that could automatically flip the boy into a state 
of fear the next time he encounters a dog, even if it's months or years later? If we look at fear as a 
natural mechanism warning us of threatening cond itions, then what is it about the way our minds 
function that would automatically tell the boy that the next encounter with a dog is something to be 
afraid of? What happened to the boy's natural sense of curiosity? There is  surely more to learn about 
the nature of dogs than this one experience has taught him, especially in light of the fact that our minds 
seem to have an unlimited capacity for learning. And why would it be virtually impossible to talk the 
boy out of his fear? 
 
THE POWER OF ASSOCIATION 
 
As complex as these questions may seem at first glance, most of them can be answered quite easi ly. I'm 
sure many of you already know the answer: Our minds have an inherent design characteristic that 
causes us to associate and link anything that exists in the external environment that is simil ar in quality, 
characteristics, properties, or traits to anything th at already exists in our mental environment as a 
memory or distinction. In other words, in the example of the child being afraid of dogs, the second dog 
or any other dog he encounters thereafter, doesn't have to be the dog that attacked in order for him to 
experience emotional pain.  
There just has to be enough of a likeness or similarity for his mind to make a connection between the 
two. This natural tendency for our minds to associate is an unconscious mental function that occ urs 
automatically. It's not something we have to thin k about or make a decision about. An unconscious 
mental function would be analogous to an involuntary physical function such as a heartbeat. Just as we 
don't have to consciously think about the process of making our hearts beat, we don't have to  think 
about linking experiences and our feelings about them. Its simply a natural function of the way our 
minds process information, and, like a heartbeat, it's a function that has a profound effect on the way 
we experience our lives.  
I'd like you to try and visualize the two-way flow  of energy that reverses the cause-and-effect 
relationship that will make it difficult (if not impossible) for the boy to perceive any other possi bilities 
than the one that's in his mind. To help you, I'm going to break this process down into its  smallest parts, 
and go through what happens step by step, All of this may seem a bit abstract, but unde rstanding this 
process plays a big part in unlocking your potential to achieve consistent success as  a big trader. First, 
let's get right down to the basics. There's structured energy on the outside of the boy and structured 
energy on the inside of the boy. The outside energy is positively charged in the form of a friendly dog 
that wants to express itself by playing.  
The inside energy is a negatively charged memory in the form of mental images and sounds that 
represent the boy's first experience with a dog. Both the inside and the outside ene rgy have the 
potential to make themselves felt on the boy's senses and, as a result, create two different kinds of 
situations for him to experience. The outside energy has the potential to act as  a force on the boy in a 
way that he could find very enjoyable. This part icular dog expresses behavior characteristics like 
playfulness, friendliness, and even love. But keep in mind that these are characteristics that the child 
still has not experienced in a dog, so from his perspective they don't exist. Just as in the price chart 
example I presented earlier, the child won't be able to perceive what he hasn't yet learned abou t, unless 
he is in a state of mind that is conducive to learning.  
The inside energy also has potential and is just waiting,  so to speak, to express itself. But it will act on 
the boy's eyes and ears in a way that causes him to feel threatened. This in turn will create an 
experience of emotional pain, fear, and possibly even  terror. From the way I've set this up, it may seem 
as if the boy has a choice between experiencing fun or experiencing fear, but that's really not the case, 
at least not in the moment. Of the two possibilities that exist in this situ ation, he will undoubtedly 
experience the pain and fear, instead of the fun. This is true for several reason s. First, as I've already 
indicated, our minds are wired to automatically and instantaneously associate and li nk information that 
has similar characteristics, properties, and traits. What's outside of the child in the form of a  dog, looks 
and sounds similar to the one that's in his mind. However, the degree of similarity that is necessary for 
his mind to link the two is an unknown variable, meaning  
I don't know the mental mechanism that determines how much or how little sim ilarity is required for 
our minds to associate and link two or more sets of information. Since everyone's mind functions in a 
similar way, but, at the same time is unique, I woul d assume there is a range of  tolerance for similarity 
or dissimilarity and each of us has a unique capacity somewhere within the range. Here's what we do 
know: As this next dog comes into contact with the boy's eyes or ears, if there is enough similarity 
between the way it looks or sounds and the dog that's embedded in his memory, then his mind will 
automatically connect the two.  
This connection, in turn, will cause the negatively charged energy in his memory to b e released 
throughout his body, causing him to be overcome with a very uncomfortable sense of foreboding or 
terror. The degree of discomfort or emotional pain that he experiences will be equivale nt to the degree 
of trauma that he suffered as a result of his first encounter with a dog.  What happens next is what 
psychologists call a projection. I'm going to refer to it  simply as another instantaneous association that 
makes the reality of the situation from the boy's pe rspective seem like the absolute, unquestionable 
truth. The boy's body is now filled with negatively charged energy.  
At the same time, he is in sensory contact with the dog. Next, his mind associates whatever sensory  
information his eyes or ears perceive with the painful energy he's experiencing ins ide himself, which 
makes it seem as if the source of his pain and fear is the dog he is seeing or hearing in that moment. 
Psychologists call the dynamics of what I just de scribed a projection because, in a sense, the boy is 
projecting the pain he is experiencing in the moment onto the dog. That painful energy th en gets 
reflected back to him, so that he perceives a dog that is threatening, painful, and dangerous. This 
process makes the second dog identical in character, properties, and traits to the one that is i n the boy's 
memory bank, even though the information the second dog is generating about its behavior is not 
identical, or even similar, to the behavior of the dog that actually attacked the boy.  
Since the two dogs, the one in the boy's mind and the one outside of the boy's mind, feel e xactly the 
same, it's extremely unlikely the boy will be able to make any type of distinc tions in the second dog's 
behavior that would suggest to him that it is any different than the one in his min d. So, instead of 
perceiving this next encounter with a dog as an opportunity to experience some thing new about the 
nature of dogs, he perceives a threatening and dangerous dog. Now, if you think about it for a moment, 
what is it about this process that would indicate to the boy that his experience of the situ ation was not 
the absolute, unquestionable truth? Ce rtainly the pain and fear that he experienced in his body was the 
absolute truth. But what about the possibilities that he perceived? Were they true? From our 
perspective, they weren't.  
However, from the boy's perspective, how could they be  anything but the true reality of the situation? 
What alternatives did he have? First, he can't perceive possibilities that he hasn't learned about yet. And 
it is extremely difficult to learn anything new if you're afraid, because, as you already well know, fear 
is a very debilitating form of energy. It causes us to withdraw, to get ready to protec t ourselves, to run, 
and to narrow our focus of attention —all of which makes it veiy difficult, if not impossible , to open 
ourselves in a way that allows us to learn something new. Second, as I have already indicated, as far as 
die boy is concerned, the dog is the source of his pain, and in a sense this is true.  
The second dog did cause him to tap into the pain that was already in his mind, but it was not the true 
source of that pain. This was a positively charge d dog that got connected to the boy's negatively 
charged energy by an automatic, involuntary mental process, functioning at speeds faster than it  takes 
to blink an eye (a process that the boy has absolutely no awareness of). So as far as he's co ncerned, 
why would he be afraid if what he perceived about the dog wasn't the absolute tr uth? As you can see, it 
wouldn't make any difference how the dog was acting, or what someone might say to the contr ary 
about why the boy shouldn't be afraid, because he will perceive whatever information the dog is 
generating about itself (reg ardless of how positive) from a negative  perspective. He will not have the 
slightest notion that his experience of pain, fear, and terror was completely self- generated.  
Now, if it's possible for the boy to  self-generate his own pain and terror and, at the same time, be firmly 
convinced that his negative experience was coming from the environment, is it also possible for traders 
to self-generate their own experiences of fear and emotional pain as they interact with market 
information and be thoroughly convinced that thei r pain and fear was completely justified by the 
circumstances? The underlining psychological dynamics work in exactly the same way. One of your 
basic objectives as a trader is to perceive the oppor tunities available, not the threat of pain. To learn 
how to stay focused on the opportunities, you need to know and understand in no uncertain terms the 
source of the threat. It's not the market.  
The market generates information about its potential to move from a neutral perspective. At the same 
time, it provides you (the observer) with an unending stream of opportunities to do something on your 
own behalf. If what you perceive at any given moment causes you to feel fear, a sk yourself this 
question: Is the information inherently threatening, or are you simply experiencing the effect of your 
own state of mind reflected back to you (as in the a bove illustration)? I know this is a difficult concept 
to accept, so I'll give you another example to illustrate the point. Let's set up a scenario, wher e your last 
two or three trades were losers.  
You are watching the market, and the variables you use to indicate that an opportunity exists are now 
present. Instead of immediately executing the trade, you hesitate. The trade feels very risk y, so risky, in 
fact, that you start ques tioning whether this is "really" a signal. As a result, you start gathering 
information to support why this trade probably won' t work. This is informatio n you normally wouldn't 
consider or pay attention to, and it's certainly not information that is part of your trading methodology. 
In the meantime, the market is moving. Unfortunate ly, it is moving away from your original entry 
point, the point at which you would have gotten into the trade if you hadn't hesitated. N ow you are 
conflicted, because you still want to get in; the thou ght of missing a winning trade is painful. At the 
same time, as the market moves away from your entry point, the dollar value of the risk  to participate 
increases. The tug of war inside your mind intensifies.  
You don't want to miss out, but you don't want to get whipsawed either. In the end, you do nothing, 
because you are paralyzed by the conflict. You justify your state of immobility by telling you rself that 
it's just too risky to chase the market, while you agonize over every tic the market moves in the 
direction of what would have been a nice winning trade. If this scenario sounds fa miliar, I want you to 
ask yourself whether, at the moment you hesitated, were you perceiving what the mark et was making 
available, or perceiving what was in your mind reflected back to you? The market gave you a si gnal. 
But you didn't perceive the signal from an objective or positive perspective. You didn't see it as an 
opportunity to experience the positive feeling you would get from winning or m aking money, but that's 
exactly what the market was making available to you.  
Think about this for a moment: If I change the scen ario so that your last two or three trades were 
winners instead of losers, would you have perceived the signal any differently? Would you have 
perceived it more as an opportunity to win than you did in the first scenario? If you were coming off 
three winners in a row, would you have hesitated to put that trade on? Very unlikely! In fact, if you're 
like most traders, you probably would have been giving very strong consideration to loading  up 
(putting on a position much larger than your normal size). In each situation, the market generated the 
same signal. But your state of mind was negative an d fear-based in the first scenario, and that caused 
you to focus on the possibility of fa ilure, which in turn caused you to  hesitate. In the second scenario, 
you hardly perceived any risk at all. You may even have thought the market was mak ing a dream come 
true.  
That, in turn, would make it easy, if not compelling, to financially overcommit yourself. If you can 
accept the fact that the market doesn't generate positively or negatively charged information as an 
inherent characteristic of the way it expresses itself , then the only other way information can take on a 
positive or negative charge is in your mind, and that is a function of the way the inform ation is 
processed. In other words, the market doesn't cause you to focus on failure and pain, or  on winning and 
pleasure. What causes the information to take on a positive or negative quality is the sam e unconscious 
mental process that caused the boy to perceive the second dog as threatening and dangerous, when all 
the dog was offering was playfulness and friendship.  
Our minds constantly associate what's outside of us (information) with something that's already in our 
mind (what we know), making it seem as if the outs ide circumstances and the memory, distinction, or 
belief these circumstances are associated with are exactly the same. As a result, in the first scenario, if 
you were coming off two or three losing trades, the next signal the market give s you that an 
opportunity was present will feel overly risky. Your mind is automatically and unconsci ously linking 
the "now moment" with your most re cent trading experiences. The link ta ps you into the pain of losing, 
creating a fearful state of mind and causing you to perceive the information you're exposed  to in that 
moment from a negative perspective. It seems as if the market is expressing threatening information, 
so, of course, your hesitation is justified. In the second scenario, the same process causes you t o 
perceive the situation from an overly positive perspective, because you are coming off thre e winners in 
a row.  
The association between the "now moment" and the elation of the last three trades creates an overly 
positive or euphoric state of mind, making it seem as if the market is offering you a riskless 
opportunity. Of course, th is justifies overcommitting yourself. In Chapter 1, I said that many of the 
mental patterns that cause traders to lose and make errors are so self-evident and deeply ingrained that 
it would never occur to us that the reason we aren't consistently successful is because of the way we 
think. Understanding, becoming consciously aware of, and then learning how to circumvent the mi nd's 
natural propensity to associate is a big part of achieving that consistency. Develo ping and maintaining a 
state of mind that perceives the opportunity flow of the market, without the threat of pain or the 
problems caused by overconfidence, will require that you take conscious control of the association 
process. CHAPTER 6  
 
CHAPTER 6  
 
THE MARKET'S PERSPECTIVE 
 
For the most part, a typical traders perception of the risk in any given trading situation is a function of 
the outcome of his most recent two or three trades (depending on the individual). The best traders, on 
the other hand, are not impacted (either negatively or too positively) by the outcomes of the ir last or 
even their last several trades. So their perception of the risk of any given trading situation is not 
affected by this personal, psychological variable. There's a huge psychological gap here that might lead 
you to believe that the best traders have inherent design qualities in their minds tha t account for this 
gap, but I can assure you this is not the case. Every trader I've worked with over the  last 18 years has 
had to learn how to train his mind to stay properly focused in the "now moment opportunity flow." This 
is a universal problem, and has to do both with the way our minds are wired and our common social  
upbringing (meaning, this particular trading problem is not personspecific).  
There are other factors relating to self-esteem that may also act as obstacles to your cons istent success, 
but what we are going to discuss now is the most important and fundamental building block to your 
success as a trader.  
 
THE "UNCERTAIN TY" PRINCIPLE 
 
If there is such a thing as a secret to the nature of tr ading, this is it: At the ve ry core of one's ability 1) 
to trade without fear or overconfidence, 2) perceive what the market is offering f rom its perspective, 3) 
stay completely focused in the "now moment opportunity flow," and 4) spontaneo usly enter the "zone," 
it is a strong virtually unshakeable belief in an uncer tain outcome with an edge in your favor. The best 
traders have evolved to the point where they believe, without a shred of doubt or internal conflict, that 
"anything can happen."  
They don't just suspect that anything can happen or give lip service to the idea. Their belief in 
uncertainty is so powerful that it actually prev ents their minds from associating the "now moment" 
situation and circumstance with the outcomes of their most recent trades.By preventing this association, 
they are able to keep their minds free of unrealistic  and rigid expectations about how the market will 
express itself. Instead of generating the kind of unrealistic expectations that more often tha n not result 
in both emotional and financial pain, they have learned to "make themselves available" to take 
advantage of whatever opportunities the market may offer in any given moment.  "Making yourself 
available" is a perspective from which you understand that the framework from which you are 
perceiving information is limited relative to what's being offered.  
Our minds don't automatically perceive every opportunity that presents its elf in any given moment. 
(The "boy and the dog" illustration from Chapter 5 is a perfect example of how our own personal 
versions of the truth are reflected back to us.) This same land of perceptual blindness happens a ll the 
time in trading. We can't perceive the potential for the market to continue to move in a direction tha t is 
already against our position if, for example, we are op erating out of a fear of being wrong. The fear of 
admitting we are wrong causes us to place an inor dinate amount of significance on information that 
tells us that we're right. This happens even if ther e's ample information to indicate that the market has 
in fact established a trend in the opposite direction of our position.  
A trending market is a distinction about the market 's behavior we can ordinarily perceive, but this 
distinction can easily become invisible if we are operating out of fear. The trend and the  opportunity to 
trade in the direction of that trend don't become visi ble until we are out of the trade. In addition, there 
are opportunities that are invisible to us because we haven't learned to make the distinctions that wo uld 
allow us to perceive them. Recall our discussion in Chapter 5 of the first price chart you ever looked at. 
What we haven't learned yet is invisible to us, and remains invisible until our minds are open to an 
exchange of energy. A perspective from which you make yourself available takes into consider ation 
both the known and the unknown: For example, you've built a mental framework that allows you to 
recognize a set of variables in the markets behavior th at indicates when an opportunity to buy or sell is 
present. This is your edge and something you know.  
However, what you don't know is exactly how the pattern your va riables identify will unfold. With the 
perspective of making yourself available, you know that your edge places the odds of suc cess in your 
favor, but, at the same time, you completely accept the fact that you don't know the outcome of any 
particular trade. By making yourself available, you consciously open yourself up to  find out what will 
happen next; instead of giving way to an automatic mental process that causes you to think yo u already 
know. Adopting this perspective leaves your mind free of internal resistan ce that can prevent you from 
perceiving whatever opportunity the market is making available from its perspective (its truth). Yo ur 
mind is open for an exchange of energy. Not only can you learn something about the market that yo u 
previously didn't know, but you also set up the mental condition most conduciv e to entering "the zone."  
The essence of what it means to be in "the zone" is that your mind and the market are in sync . As a 
result, you sense what the market is about to do as if there is no separation between yourself and the 
collective consciousness of everyone else participating in the market. The zone is a mental space where 
you are doing more than just reading the collective mind, you are also in complete harmony with it. If 
this sounds a bit strange to you, ask yourself how it is that a flock of birds or a school of fish can 
change direction simultaneously. There must be a way in  which they are linked to one another. If it is 
possible for people to become linked in the same wa y, then there will be time s when information from 
those with whom we are linked can and will bleed through to our consciousness.  
Traders who have experienced being tapped into the collective consciousness of the market can 
anticipate a change in direction just as a bird in the middle of a flock or a fish in the m iddle of a school 
will turn at the precise moment that all of the ot hers turn. However, setting up the kind of mental 
conditions most conducive to experiencing this se emingly magical synchronicity between you and the 
market is no easy task. There are two mental hurdles to overcome.  
The first is the focus of this chapter: learning how to keep your mind focused in the "now moment 
opportunity flow." In order to experience synchronicity, your mind has to be open to t he market's truth, 
from its perspective. The second hurdle has to do with the division of labor betwee n the two halves of 
our brain. The left side of our brain specializes in rational thought, based on what we alrea dy know. 
The right side specializes in creative thought. It is capable of tapping into an inspiration, an intuition , a 
hunch, or a sense of knowing that usually can't be explained at a rational level. It can't be expl ained 
because if the information is really creative in natu re, then it is something that we wouldn't know at a 
rational level. By definition, true creativity brings forth something that didn't previously exist. There's 
an inherent conflict between these two modes of t hought, that the rational, logical part will almost 
always win, unless we take specific steps to train our minds to accept and trust creative information. 
Without that training, we will usually find it very difficult to act on our hunches, intuitive impu lses, 
inspirations, or sense of knowing.  
Acting appropriately on anything requires belief and clarity of intent, which keeps our minds and 
senses focused on the purpose at hand. If the source of our actions is creative in nature, and our rational 
mind hasn't been properly trained to trust this source, then at some point in the pr ocess of acting on this 
information, our rational brain w ill flood our consciousness with co nflicting and competing thoughts. 
Of course, all of these thoughts will be sound and reasonable in nature, beca use they will be coming 
from what we already know at a rational level, but they will have the effect of flipping us out of  "the 
zone" or any other creative state of mind. There are few things in life more frustrating  than recognizing 
the possibilities evident from a hunch, intuition, or an  inspired idea, and not taking advantage of that 
potential because we talked ourselves out of it. I reali ze that what I've just said is still much too abstract 
to implement on a practical basis. So, I'm going to take you step-by-step through what it means to be 
completely focused in the "now moment opportunity flow."  
My objective is that by the time you've read this chapter and Chapter 7, you will understand withou t a 
shred of doubt why your ultimate success as a trader cannot be realized until you develop a resolute, 
unshakeable belief in uncertainty. The first step on the road toward getting your mi nd and the market in 
sync is to understand and completely  accept the psychological realities of trading. This step is where 
most of the frustrations, disappointments, and mysteriousness associated with trading b egin.  
Very few people who decide to trade ever take the time or expend the effort to think about what it 
means to be a trader. Most people who go into trad ing think that being a trader is synonymous with 
being a good market analyst. As I have mentioned, this couldn't be further fr om the truth. Good market 
analysis can certainly contribute to and play a supporting role in one's success, but it doesn' t deserve 
the attention and importance most traders mistakenly attach to it. Beneath the market behavior patterns 
that are so easy to become fixated on are some very unique psychological characteristics. It's the nature 
of these psychological characteristics that determines how one needs "to be" in order to operate 
effectively in the market environment.  
Operating effectively in an environment that has qualities, traits, or characteristics that are different 
from what we're used to requires making some adjustments or changes in the way we norm ally think 
about things. For example, if you were to travel to an exotic place with certain objectives or goals to 
accomplish, the first thing you would do is familiarize yourself with the local traditions and customs. 
By doing so, you would leani about the various ways in which you would have to ad apt in order to 
function successfully in that environment. Traders frequently ignore the fact that they may have to 
adapt in order to become consistently successful traders. There are two reasons for this.  
The first is that you need absolutely no skill of any kind to put on a winning trad e. For most traders it 
usually takes years of pain and suffering before they figure out or finally admit to themselves that  
there's more to being consistent than the ability to pi ck an occasional winner. Th e second reason is that 
you don't have to travel anywhere to trade. All you need is access to a phone. You don't even ha ve to 
roll out of bed in the morning. Even traders who normally trade from an office don't have to be in the 
office to put on or take off their trades. Because we can access and interact with the  market from 
personal environments that we are intimately familiar with, it seems as if trad ing won't require any 
special adaptations in the way we think.  
To some degree, you are probably already aware of many of the fundamental truths (p sychological 
characteristics) about the nature of trading. But ha ving an awareness or an understanding of some 
principle, insight, or concept doesn't necessarily equate to acceptance and belief. When something has 
been truly accepted, it isn't in conflict with any ot her component of our mental environment. When we 
believe in something, we operate out of that belief as a natural function of who we are, with out struggle 
or extra effort. To whatever degree there is a conflict with any other component of our mental 
environment, to the same degree there is a lack of acceptance. It isn't difficult, therefore, to understand 
why so few people make it as traders.  
They simply don't do the mental work necessary to reconcile the many conflicts that exist between 
what they've already learned and believe, and how that learning contradicts and acts as a source of 
resistance to implementing the various principles of successful trading. Getting into and taki ng 
advantage of the kind of free-flowing states of mind that are ideal for trading requires that those 
conflicts be thoro ughly resolved.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MARKETS MOST FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC  
(IT CAN EXPRESS ITSELF IN AN ALMOST INFINITE COMBINATION OF WAYS ) 
 
The market can do virtually anything at any time. This seems obvious enough, especially for anybody 
who has experienced a market that has displayed erratic and volatile price swings. The problem is that 
all of us have the tendency to take this characterist ic for granted, in ways that cause us to make the 
most fundamental trading errors over and over again. The fact is that if traders really believed that 
anything could happen at any time, there would be considerably fewer losers and more c onsistent 
winners. How do we know that virtually anything can  happen? This fact is easy to establish. All we 
have to do is dissect the market into its component parts and look at how the parts operate. The most 
fundamental component of any market is its traders. Individual traders act as a force on prices, making 
them move by either bidding a pr ice up or offering it lower.  
Why do traders bid a price up or offer it lower? To answer this question we have to establish the 
reasons why people trade. There are many reasons and purposes behind a person s motivation to trade 
in any given market. However, for the purposes of this illustration, we don't have to know all the 
underlying reasons that compel any individual trader to act because ultimately they all boil down to one 
reason and one purpose: to make money. We know th is because there are only two things a trader can 
do (buy and sell) and there are only two possible outcomes for every trade (profit or loss ). Therefore, I 
think we can safely assume that regardless of one's reasons for trad ing, the bottom line is that everyone 
is looking for the same outcome: Profits. And there are only two ways to create those profits: Either 
buy low and sell high, or sell high and buy low. If we assume that everyone wants to  make money, then 
there's only one reason why any trader would bid a price up to the next highest level: because he 
believes he can sell whatever he's buying at a higher price at some point in the future.  
The same is true for the trader who's willing to sell something at a price that is less than the last posted 
price (offer a market lower). He does it because he believes he can buy back whatever he 's selling at a 
lower price at some point in the future. If we look at the market's behavior as a function of price 
movement, and if price movement is a function of traders who are willing to bid prices up o r offer them 
lower, then we can say that all price movement (market behavior) is a function of what traders believe 
about the future. To be more specific, all price movement is a function of what individual traders 
believe about what is high and what is low. The underlying dynamics of market behavior are quite 
simple. Only three primary forces exist in any market : traders who believe the price is low, traders who 
believe the price is high, and traders who are watching and waiting to make up their mi nds about 
whether the price is low or high. Technically, the third group constitutes a potential force. The rea sons 
that support any given traders belief that something is high or low are usually irrelevant, because most 
people who trade act in an undisciplined, unorganized, haphazard, and random manner. So, their 
reasons wouldn't necessarily help anyone gain a better understanding of what is going on. But, 
understanding what's going on isn't that difficult, if you remember that all price movem ent or lack of 
movement is a function of the relative balance or imbalance between two primary forces: traders who 
believe the price is going up, and traders who believe the price is going down.  
If there's balance between the two groups, prices will stagnate, because  each side will absorb the force 
of the other side's actions. If there is an imbalance, prices will move in the direction o f the greater 
force, or the traders who have the stronger convictions in their beliefs about in what dire ction the price 
is going. Now, I want you to ask yourself, what's going to stop virtually anything from happening at 
any time, other than exchange-imposed limits on price movement. There's nothing to stop the price of 
an issue from going as high or low as whatever some trader in the world believes is possible—if, of 
course, the trader is willing to act on that belief. So the range of the market's behavior in its collective 
form is limited only by the most extreme beliefs about what is high and what is low held by any given 
individual participating in that market. I think the implications are self-evident:  
There can be an extreme diversity of beliefs present in any given market in a ny given moment, making 
virtually anything possible. When we look at the market from this perspective, it's easy to see that 
every potential trader who is willing to express his belief about the future be comes a market variable. 
On a more personal level, this means that it only takes one other trader, anywhere in the  world, to 
negate the positive potential of your trade. Put another way, it takes only one other trader to ne gate 
what you believe about what is high or what is low. Th at's all, only one! Here's an example to illustrate 
this point. Several years ago, a trader came to me for help. He was an excellent market analyst;  in fact, 
he was one of the best I've ever met. But after years of frustration during which he lost all his m oney 
and a lot of other people's money, he was finally ready to admit that, as a trader, he left a lot to be  
desired. After talking to him for a while, I determined that a number of serious psych ological obstacles 
were preventing him from being successful.  
One of the most troublesome obstacles was that he was a know-it-all and extremely arrogant, making it 
impossible for him to achieve the degree of mental fl exibility required to trade effectively. It didn't 
matter how good an analyst he was. When he came to me, he was so desperate for money and help that  
he was willing to consider anything. The first suggest ion I made was that instead of looking for another 
investor to back what ultimately would be another failed attempt at trading, he would be be tter off 
taking a job, doing something he was truly good at. He could be paid a steady income while working 
through his problems, and at the sa me time provide someone with a worthwhile service. He took my 
advice and quickly found a position as a technical analyst with a fairly substantial brok erage house and 
clearing firm in Chicago.  
The semiretired chairman of the board of the brokerage firm was a longtime trader with nearly 40 years 
of experience in the grain pits at the Chicago Board of Trade. He didn't know much about technical 
analysis, because he never needed it to make money on the floor. But he no longer traded on the floor 
and found the transition to trading from a screen difficult and somewhat my sterious. So he asked the 
firm's newly acquired star technical analyst to sit with him during the trading day and t each him 
technical trading. The new hire jumped at the opportunity to show off his abilities  to such an 
experienced and successful trader. The analyst was using a method called "point and line," develope d 
by Charlie Drummond. (Among other things, point and line can accurately define s upport and 
resistance.) One day, as the two of them were watching the soybean market together, the analyst had 
projected major support and resistance points and the market happened to be trading between these two 
points.  
As the technical analyst was explaining to the chairm an the significance of these two points, he stated 
in very emphatic, almost absolute terms that if the market goes up to resistance, it will stop and reverse; 
and if the market goes down to support, it will also stop and reverse. Then he ex plained that if the 
market went down to the price level he calculated as support, his calculations indicated tha t would also 
be the low of the day. As they sat there, the bean market was slowly trending down to the price the 
analyst said would be the support, or low, of the day. When it finally got there, the chairman look ed 
over to the analyst and said, "This is where the market is supposed to stop and go higher, right?"  
The analyst responded, "Absolutely! This is the low of the day." "That's bullshit!" the chairman 
retorted. "Watch this." He picked up the phone, calle d one of the clerks handling orders for the soybean 
pit, and said, "Sell two million beans (bushels) at the market." Within thirty seconds after he placed the 
order, the soybean market dropped ten cents a bushel. The chairman turned to look at the horrified 
expression on the analysts face. Calmly, he asked, "Now, where did you say the market was goi ng to 
stop? If I can do that, anyone can."  
The point is that from our own individual perspective as observers of the market, anything can  happen, 
and it takes only one trader to do it. This is the hard , cold reality of trading that only the very best 
traders have embraced and accepted with no intern al conflict. How do I know  this? Because only the 
best traders consistently predefine their risks before entering a trade. Only the best traders cut their 
losses without reservation or hesitation when the market tells them the trade isn't working. And only 
the best traders have an organized, systematic, money-management regimen for taking profits when  the 
market goes in the direction of their trade. Not pred efining your risk, not cutting your losses, or not 
systematically taking profits are three of the most common—and usually the most costly—trading 
errors you can make. Only the best traders have e liminated these errors from their trading. At some 
point in their careers, they learned to believe without a shred of doubt that anything can happen, and to 
always account for what they don't know, for the unexpected. Remember that there are only two forces 
that cause prices to move: traders who believe th e markets are going up, and traders who believe the 
markets are going down. At any given moment, we can see who has the stronge r conviction by 
observing where the market is now relative to where it was at some previous moment. If a recognizable 
pattern is present, that pattern may repeat itself, giving us an indication of where the market is headed. 
This is our edge, something we know. But there's al so much that we don't know, and will never know 
unless we learn how to read minds. For instance , do we know how many traders may be sitting on the 
sidelines and about to enter the market? Do we know how many of them want to buy and how many 
want to sell, or how many shares they are willing to buy or sell? What about the traders w hose 
participation is already reflected in the current price? At any given moment, how many  of them are 
about to change their minds and exit their positions?  
If they do, how long will they stay out of the market? And if and when they do come back into the  
market, in what direction will they cast their vo tes? These are th e constant, never-ending, unknown, 
hidden variables that are always operating in every market— always] The best traders don't try to hide 
from these unknown variables by pretending they don't exist, nor do they try to intellectualize or 
rationalize them away through market analysis. Quite the contrary, the best traders take these va riables 
into account, factoring them into every component of their trading regimes. For the typical trader, just 
the opposite is true. He trades from the perspective that what he can't see, hear, or feel must not exist. 
What other explanation could account for his behavior? If he really believed in the existence of  all the 
hidden variables that have the potential to act on prices in any given moment, then he would also ha ve 
to believe that every trade has an uncertain outcome. And if every trade truly has an uncertain outco me, 
then how could he ever justify or talk himself into not predefining his ris k, cutting his losses, or having 
some systematic way to take profits? Given the circ umstances, not adhering to these three fundamental 
principles is the equivalent of committing financial and emotional suicide. Since most traders don't 
adhere to these principles, are we to assume that their true underlying motiva tion for trading is to 
destroy themselves? It's certainly possible, but I think the percentage of traders who either consc iously 
or subconsciously want to rid themselves of their mo ney or hurt themselves in some way is extremely 
small. So, if financial suicide is not the predominant reason, then what could keep someone f rom doing 
something that would otherwise make absolute, perfe ct sense? The answer is quite simple: The typical 
trader doesn't predefine his risk, cut his losses, or systematically take profits because the typ ical trader 
doesn't believe it's necessary. The only reason why he would believe it isn't necessary is th at he 
believes he already knows what's going to happen next, based on what he perceives is happening in any 
given "now moment." 
If he already knows, then there's really no reason to adhere to these principles. Believing, assuming, or 
thinking that "he knows" will be the cause of virtually eveiy trading error he has th e potential to make 
(with the exception of those errors that are the result of not believing that he de serves the money). Our 
beliefs about what is true and real are very powerful inner forces.  
They control every aspect of how we interact with the markets, from our perceptions, interpretations, 
decisions, actions, and expectations, to our feelings about the results. It's extremely difficult to act in a 
way that contradicts what we believe to be true. In some cases, depending on the strength of t he belief, 
it can be next to impossible to do anything that violates the integrity of a belief. W hat the typical trader 
doesn't realize is that he needs an inner mechanism, in the form of some powerful beliefs,  that virtually 
compels him to perceive the market from a perspective that is always expanding with greater and 
greater degrees of clarity, and also compels him always act appropriately, given the psychological 
conditions and the nature of price movement. The most  effective and functional trading belief that he 
can acquire is "anything can happen." Aside from the fact that it is the truth, it will act as a solid 
foundation for building every other belief and attitude that he needs to be a succ essful trader. Without 
that belief, his mind will automatically, and usua lly without his conscious awareness, cause him to 
avoid, block, or rationalize away any information that indicates the market m ay do something he hasn't 
accepted as possible.  
If he believes that anything is possible, then there's nothing for his mind to avoid. Because anything 
includes everything, this belief will act as an expans ive force on his perception of the market that will 
allow him to perceive information that might otherwise have been invisible to him. In essence, he will 
be making himself available (opening his mind) to perceive more of the possibilities tha t exist from the 
markets perspective. Most important, by establishi ng a belief that anything can happen, he will be 
training his mind to think in probabilities. This is by far the most essential as well as the most difficult 
principle for people to grasp and to effectively integrate into their mental systems. CHAPTER 7  
 
CHAPTER 7  
 
THE TRADER'S EDGE: THIN KING IN PROBABILITIES 
 
Exactly what does it mean to think in probabilities, an d why is it so essential to one's consistent success 
as a trader? If you take a moment and analyze the last sentence, you will notice that I made co nsistency 
a function of probabilities. It sounds like a contra diction: How can someone produce consistent results 
from an event that has an uncertain probabilistic outcome? To answer this question, all we have to  do is 
look to the gambling industry. Corporations spend vast amounts of money, in the hundreds of millions, 
if not billions, of dollars, on elaborate hotels to attract people to their casinos.  
If you've been to Las Vegas you know exactly what I am talking about. Gaming corporations are just 
like other corporations, in that they have to justify how they allocate their assets to a board of directors 
and ultimately to their stockholders. How do you suppose they justify spending vast sums of money o n 
elaborate hotels and casinos, whose primary function is to generate revenue from an event that has a 
purely random outcome?  
 
PROBABILITIES PARADOX: RANDOM OUTCOME, CONSISTENT RESULTS 
 
Here's an interesting paradox. Casinos make consistent profits day after day and year after year,  
facilitating an event that has a purely random outcome . At the same time, most traders believe that the 
outcome of the market's behavior is not random, yet can't seem to produce consistent profits.  Shouldn't 
a consistent, nonrandom outcome produce consistent results, and a random outcome produce random, 
inconsistent results? What casino owners, experienced gamblers, and the best traders understand that 
the typical trader finds difficult to grasp is: even that have probable outcomes can produce consi stent 
results, if you can get the odds in your favor and there is a large enough sample size. The bes t traders 
treat trading like a numbers game, similar to the way in which casinos and professional gamblers 
approach gambling. To illustrate, let's look at the game of blackjack. In blackjack, the casinos  have 
approximately a 4.5-percent edge over the player, based on the rules they require pl ayers to adhere to. 
This means that, over a large enough sample size (number of hands played), the casino will generate 
net profits of four and a half cents on every dollar wagered on the game. This average of four and a half 
cents takes into account all the players who walked away big winners (in cluding all winning streaks), 
all the players who walked away big losers, and everybody in between. At the end of the day, week, 
month, or year, the casino always ends up with approximately 4.5 percent of the total amount wagered.  
That 4.5 percent might not sound like a lot, but let's put it in perspective. Suppose a total of $100 
million dollars is wagered collectively at all of a casino's blackjack tables over the c ourse of a year. The 
casino will net $4.5 million. What casino owners  and professional gamble rs understand about the 
nature of probabilities is that each individual hand played is statistically independe nt of every other 
hand. This means that each individual hand is a un ique event, where the outcome is random relative to 
the last hand played or the next hand played. If you focus on each hand individuall y, there will be a 
random, unpredictable distribution between winning and losing hands. But on a collective basi s, just 
the opposite is true. If a large en ough number of hands is played, patterns will emerge that produce a 
consistent, predictable, and statistically reliable outcome.  
Here's what makes thinking in probabilities so diffic ult. It requires two layers  of beliefs that on the 
surface seem to contradict each other. We'll call the first layer the micro level. At this level, you have 
to believe in the uncertainty and unpredictability of  each individual hand. You know the truth of this 
uncertainty, because there are always a number of unknown variables affecting the consistency of the 
deck that each new hand is drawn from. For example, you can't know in advance how any of the other 
participants will decide to play their hands, since th ey can either take or decline additional cards. Any 
variables acting on the consistency of  the deck that can't be controll ed or known in advance will make 
the outcome of any particular hand both uncertain and random (statistically independent) in 
relationship to any other hand. The second layer is the macro level. At this level, you have to belie ve 
that the outcome over a series of hands played is relatively certain and predictable. The  degree of 
certainty is based on the fixed or constant variables that are known in advance and speci fically 
designed to give an advantage (edge) to one side or the other.  
The constant variables I am referring to are the rules of the game. So, even though you don't or couldn't 
know in advance (unless you are psychic) the sequence of wins to losses, you c an be relatively certain 
that if enough hands are played, whoever has the edge will end up wi th more wins than losses. The 
degree of certainty is a function of how good th e edge is. It's the ability to believe in the 
unpredictability of the game at the micro level and simultaneously believe in the predictability of the 
game at the macro level that makes the casino and the professional gambler effective and suc cessful at 
what they do. Their belief in the uniqueness of each hand prevents them from engaging in the pointless 
endeavor of trying to predict the outcome of each individual hand. They have lea rned and completely 
accepted the fact that they don't know what's going to happen next. More important, the y don't need to 
know in order to make money consistently.  
Because they don't have to know what's going to happ en next, they don't place any special significance, 
emotional or otherwise, on each individual hand, spin of the wheel, or roll of the dice.  In other words, 
they're not encumbered by unrealistic expectations about what is going to happen, nor are their egos 
involved in a way that makes them have to be right. As a result, it's easier to stay focused on keeping 
the odds in their favor and executing flawlessly, which in turn makes them less susceptible to making 
costly mistakes.  
They stay relaxed because they are committed and wi lling to let the probabilities (their edges) play 
themselves out, all the while knowing that if their edges are good enough and the sample sizes are big 
enough, they will come out net winners. The best traders use the same thinking strategy as the casino 
and professional gambler. Not only does it work to their benefit, but the underlying dynamics 
supporting the need for such a strategy are exactly the same in trading as they are in gambling.  
A simple comparison between the two will demonstrate th is quite clearly. First, the trader, the gambler, 
and the casino are all dealing with both known and unknown variables that affect the outcome of each 
trade or gambling event. In gambling, the known variables are the rules of the game. In trading,  the 
known variables (from each individual trader's perspective) are the results of their market analysis. 
Market analysis finds behavior patterns in the collective actions of everyone participating in a mark et. 
We know that individuals will act the same way under similar situations and circumstances, over and 
over again, producing observable patterns of behavior. By the same token, groups of indivi duals 
interacting with one another, day after day, week after week, also produce behavior patterns that re peat 
themselves. These collective behavior patterns can be discovered and sub- «pnii<=-nflv id entified bv 
nsinf analvtical tools such as trend lines, moving aver ages, oscillators, or retracements, just to name a 
few of the thousands that are available to any trader. Each analytical tool uses a set of criteria to define 
the boundaries of each behavior pattern identified. Th e set of criteria and the boundaries identified are 
the trader's known market variables.  
They are to the individual trader what the rules of the game are to the casino  and gambler. By this I 
mean, the trader's analytical tools are the known variables that put the odds of success (the edge) for 
any given trade in the trader's favor, in the same way that the rules of the game put the odds of success 
in favor of the casino. Second, we know that in gambling a number of unknown variables act on the 
outcome of each game. In blackjack, the unknowns are the shuffling of the deck and ho w the players 
choose to play their hands. In craps, it's how the dice are thrown. And in roulette, it's the amount of 
force applied to spin the wheel. All these unknown variables act as forces on the outcome of each 
individual event, in a way that causes each event to be statistically independent of any other individua l 
event, thereby creating a random distribution between wins and losses. Trading also involv es a number 
of unknown variables that act on the outcome of any particular behavior pattern a trader may identify 
and use as his edge. In trading, the unknown variables are all other traders who have the potential to 
come into the market to put on or take off a trade.  
Each trade contributes to the market's position at any given moment, which means that each trader, 
acting on a belief about what is high and what is low, contributes to the collective behavior pattern that 
is displayed at that moment. If there is a recognizable pattern, and if the variables used to define that 
pattern conform to a particular trader's definition of an edge, then we can say that the  market is offering 
the trader an opportunity to buy low or sell high, based on the trader's definition. Suppose the trader 
seizes the opportunity to take adva ntage of his edge and puts on a trade. What factors will determine 
whether the market unfolds in the direction of his edge or against it? The answer is: the behavio r of 
other traders!  
At the moment he puts a trade on, and for as long as he chooses to stay in that trade, other traders wi ll 
be participating in that market. They will be acting on their beliefs about what is high and what is low. 
At any given moment, some percentage of other traders will contribute to an outcome favo rable to our 
traders edge, and the participation of some percentage of traders will negate his edge. Th ere's no way to 
know in advance how every one else is going to behave and how th eir behavior will affect his trade, so 
the outcome of the trade is uncertain.  
The fact is, the outcome of every (legal) trade that anyone decides to make is affected in some way by 
the subsequent behavior of other traders participatin g in that market, making the outcome of all trades 
uncertain. Since all trades have an uncertain outcome, then like gambling, each trade has to b e 
statistically independent of the next trade, the last trade, or any trades in the future, eve n though the 
trader may use the same set of known variables to identify his edge for each trade. Furthermore, i f the 
outcome of each individual trade is statistically independent of every other trade, there must also be a  
random distribution between wins and losses in any given string or set of trades, even though the odds 
of success for each individual trade may be in the traders favor.  
Third, casino owners don't try to predict or know in advance the outcome of each individual event. 
Aside from the fact that it would be extremely di fficult, given all the unknown variables operating in 
each game, it isn't necessary to create consistent results. Casino operators have learned that all they 
have to do is keep the odds in their favor and have  a large enough sample size of events so that their 
edges have ample opportunity to work.  
 
TRADING IN THE MOMENT 
 
Traders who have learned to think in probabilities approach the markets from virtually the same 
perspective. At the micro level, they believe that each trade or edge is unique. What they unders tand 
about the nature of trading is that at any given moment, the market may look exactly the same on a 
chart as it did at some previous moment; and the geometric measurements and mathematical 
calculations used to determine each edge can be exactly the same from one edge to  the next; but the 
actual consistency of the market itself from one moment to the next is nev er the same.  
For any particular pattern to be exactly the same now as it was in some previous moment would req uire 
that every trader who participated in that previous moment be present. What's more, each  of them 
would also have to interact with one another in exactly the same way over some period  of time to 
produce the exact same outcome to whatever pattern was being observed. The odds of  that happening 
are nonexistent. It is extremely important that you understand this phenomenon because the 
psychological implications for your trading couldn't be more important.  
We can use all the various tools to analyze the market's behavior and find the patterns that represent the 
best edges, and from an analytical perspective, these patterns can appear to be precisely th e same in 
eveiy respect, both mathematically and visually. But, if the consistency of the group of tra ders who are 
creating the pattern "now" is different by even one person from the group that crea ted the pattern in the 
past, then the outcome of the current pattern has the potential to be different from the pa st pattern. (The 
example of the analyst and chairman illustrates this point quite well.) It takes only one trader, 
somewhere in the world, with a different belief about the future to change the outcome of any particular 
market pattern and negate the edge that pattern represents. The most fundamental characteristic  of the 
market's behavior is that each "now moment" market situation, each "now moment" behavior pa ttern, 
and each "now moment" edge is always a unique occurrence with its own outcome, indepen dent of all 
others. Uniqueness implies that anything can happen , either what we know (e xpect or anticipate), or 
what we don't know (or can't know, unless we had ex traordinary perceptual abilities). A constant flow 
of both known and unknown variables creates a probabilistic environment where we don't know for 
certain what will happen next.  
This last statement may seem quite logical, even self-evident, but there's a huge problem here th at is 
anything but logical or selfevident. Being aware of uncertainty and understanding the natu re of 
probabilities does not equate with  an ability to actually function effectively from a probabilistic 
perspective. Thinking in probabiliti es can be difficult to master, because our minds don't naturally 
process information in this manner. Quite the contrary, our minds cause us to perceive w hat we know, 
and what we know is part of our past, whereas, in the market, every moment is new and unique, even 
though there may be similarities to so mething that occurred in the past. This means that unless we train 
our minds to perceive the uniquene ss of each moment, tiiat uniqueness will automatically be filtered 
out of our perception. We will perceive only what we know, minus any information that is blocked by 
our fears; everything else will remain invisible.  
The bottom line is that there is some degree of sophistication to thinking in probabilities, which can 
take some people a considerable amount of effort to integrate into their mental systems as a functional 
thinking strategy. Most traders don't fully understand this; as a result, they mistakenly assume  they are 
thinking in probabilities, be cause they have some degree of underst anding of the concepts. I've worked 
with hundreds of traders who mistakenly assumed they  thought in probabilities, but didn't. Here is an 
example of a trader I worked with whom I'll call Bob. Bob is a certified trading advisor (CTA) who 
manages approximately $50 million in investments. He's been in the business for almo st 30 years. He 
came to one of my workshops because he was never able to produce more than a 12- to 18-percent 
annual return on the accounts he managed.  
This was an adequate return, but Bob was extremely dissatisfied because his analytical abilities 
suggested that he should be achieving an annual return of 150 to 200 percent. I would des cribe Bob as 
being well-versed in the nature of probabilities. In other words, he understood the con cepts, but he 
didn't function from a probabilistic perspective. Shor tly after attending the workshop, he called to ask 
me for some advice. Here is the entry from my journal written immediately after that phone 
conversation.  
9-28-95: Bob called with a problem. He put on a belly trade and put his stop in the market. T he market 
traded about a third of the way to his stop and then went back to his entry poi nt, where he decided to 
bail out of the trade. Almost immediately after he got  out, the bellies went 500 points in the direction of 
this trade, but of course he was out of the market. He didn't understand what was going on. First, I 
asked him what was at risk. He didn't understand the question. He assumed that he had accept ed the 
risk because he put in a stop. I responded that just because he put in a stop it didn't mean that he had 
truly accepted the risk of the trade. There are many things that can be at risk: losing money, being 
wrong, not being perfect, etc., depending on one's underlying motivation for trading.  I pointed out that 
a person's beliefs are always revealed by their actions.  
We can assume that he was operating out of a belief that to be a disciplined trader one has to define the 
risk and put a stop in. And so he did. But a person can put in a stop and at the same time not believ e 
that he is going to be stopped out or that the trade will ever work against him, for that matter. By the 
way he described the situation, it sounded to me as if this is exactly what happened to him. When he 
put on the trade, he didn't believe he would be sto pped out. Nor did he believe the market would trade 
against him. In fact, he was so adamant about this, that when the market came back to his entry point , 
he got out of the trade to punish the market with an "I'll show you" attitude for even going against him 
by one tic. After I pointed this out to him, he said this was exactly the attitude he had when he took off 
the trade. He said that he had been waiting for th is particular trade for weeks and when the market 
finally got to this point, he thought it would immediately reverse.  
I responded by reminding him to look at the experience as simply pointing the w ay to something that 
he needs to learn. A prerequisite for thinking in prob abilities is that you accept the risk, because if you 
don't, you will not want to face the possibilities that  you haven't accepted, if and when they do present 
themselves. When you've trained your mind to think in probabilities, it means you have fully ac cepted 
all the possibilities (with no internal resistance or conflict) and you al ways do something to take the 
unknown forces into account. Thinkine this way is virtually impossible unless you've done the mental 
work necessary to "let go" of the need to know what is going to happen next or the need to be right on 
each trade. In fact, the degree by which you think you know, assume you know, or in any way need to 
know what is going to happen next, is equal to the degree to which you will fail as a trader. Traders 
who have learned to think in prob abilities are confident of their overa ll success, because they commit 
themselves to taking every trade that conforms to their definition of an edge.  
They don't attempt to pick and choose the edges they  think, assume, or believe are going to work and 
act on those; nor do they avoid the edges that for whatever reason they think, assume, or believe aren't 
going to work. If they did either of those things, they would be contradicting their belief  that the "now" 
moment situation is always unique, creating a random distribution between wins and losses on any 
given string of edges. They have learned, usually quite painfully, that they don't know in advance 
which edges are going to work and which ones aren't. They have stopped trying to pr edict outcomes. 
They have found that by taking every edge, they correspondingly increase their sample size of tra des, 
which in turn gives whatever edge they use ample opport unity to play itself out in their favor, just like 
the casinos. On the other hand, why do you think unsuccessful traders are obsessed with market 
analysis.  
They crave the sense of certainty that analysis appears to give them. Although few would admit it, the 
truth is that the typical trader wants to be right on every single trade. He is desperately trying to create 
certainty where it just doesn't exist. The irony is th at if he completely accepte d the fact that certainty 
doesn't exist, he would create the certainty he craves: He would be absolutely certain that certainty 
doesn't exist. When you achieve complete acceptance of the uncertainty of each edge and the 
uniqueness of each moment, your frustration with trading will end. Furt hermore, you will no longer be 
susceptible to making all the typical trading errors that detract from your potential to be cons istent and 
destroy your sense of self-confidence. For examnle not rlefminff the risk before crRftincr in to a trarle is 
hv far rhp most common of all trading errors, and starts the whole process of trading from  an 
inappropriate perspective. In light of the fact that anything can happen, wouldn't it make perfect sense 
to decide before executing a trade what the market has to look, sound, or feel like to tell you your edge 
isn't working? So why doesn't the typical trader decide to do it or do it every single time?  
I have already given you the answer in the last chapter, but there's more to it and there's al so some 
tricky logic involved, but the answer is simple. The typical trader won't predef ine the risk of getting 
into a trade because he doesn't believe it's necessary. The only way he could believe "it isn't ne cessary" 
is if he believes he knows what's going to happen next. The reason he believes he knows wh at's going 
to happen next is because he won't get into a trade until he is co nvinced that he's right. At the point 
where he's convinced the trade will be a winner, it's no longer necessary to define the risk (becau se if 
he's right, there is no risk). Typical traders go through the exercise of convincing themselv es that 
they're right before they get into a trade, because the alternativ e (being wrong) is simply unacceptable. 
Remember that our minds are wired to associate.  
As a result, being wrong on any given trade has the potential to be associated with any (or e very) other 
experience in a trader's life where he's been wrong. The implication is that any trade can easily ta p him 
into the accumulated pain of every time he has been wrong in his life. Given the huge backlog  of 
unresolved, negative energy surrounding what it means to be wrong that exists in most peop le, it's easy 
to see why each and every trade can literally take on the significance of a life or death situation . So, for 
the typical trader, determining what the market would have  to look, sound, or feel like to tell him that a 
trade isn't working would create an irreconcilable dilemma. On one hand, he desperatel y wants to win 
and the only way he can do that is to participate, bu t the only way he will participate is if he's sure the 
trade will win. On the other hand, if he defines hi s risk, he is willfully ga thering evidence that would 
negate something he has already convinced himself of.  
He will be contradicting the decision-making process he went through to convince himself tha t the 
trade will work. If he exposed himself to conflicting information, it would surely create  some degree of 
doubt about the viability of the trade. If he allows hims elf to experience doubt, it 's very unlikely he will 
participate. If he doesn't put the trade on and it turn s out to be a winner, he will be in extreme agony. 
For some people, nothing hurts more than an opport unity recognized but missed because of self-doubt. 
For the typical trader, the only way out of this psyc hological dilemma is to ignore the risk and remain 
convinced that the trade is right. If any of this sounds familiar, consider this: When you're convincing 
yourself that you're right, what you're saying to yourself is, "I know who's in this market and wh o's 
about to come into this market. I know what they believe about what is high or what is low. 
Furthermore, I know each individual's capacity to act on those beliefs (the degree of clarity or rela tive 
lack of inner conflict), and with this knowledge, I am able to determine how the actions of each of 
these individuals will affect price movement in its co llective form a second, a minute, an hour, a day, or 
a week from now."  
Looking at the process of convincing yourself that  you're right from this perspective, it seems a bit 
absurd, doesn't it? For the traders who have learned to think in probabilities, there is no dilemma. 
Predefining the risk doesn't pose a problem for these traders because they don't trade from a right or 
wrong perspective. They have learned that trading doesn't have anything to do w ith being right or 
wrong on any individual trade. As a result, they don't perceive the risks of trading in the same  way the 
typical trader does. Any of the best traders (the probability thinkers) could have jus t as much negative 
energy surrounding what it means to be wrong as the typical trader.  
But as long as they legitimately define trading as  a probability game, their emotional responses to the 
outcome of any particular trade are equivalent to how the typical trader would feel abou t flipping a 
coin, calling heads, and seeing the coin come up tails. A wrong call, but for most people being wrong 
about predicting the flip of a coin would not tap them into the accumulated pain of every other time in 
their lives they had been wrong. Why? Most people know that the outcome of a coin toss is random. If 
you believe the outcome is random, then you naturally expect a random outcome. Randomness  implies 
at least some degree of uncertainty. So when we believe in a random outcome, there is an im plied 
acceptance that we don't know what that outcome w ill be. When we accept in advance of an event that 
we don't know how it will turn out, that acceptance has the effect of keeping our expectations ne utral 
and open-ended. Now we're getting down to the very core of what ails the typical trader.  Any 
expectation about the markets behavior that is specific, well-defined, or rigid—instead of being neutral 
and open-ended—is unrealistic and potentially damaging. I define an unrealistic expectation as  one that 
does not correspond with the possibilities available from the market's perspective. If each mom ent in 
the market is unique, and anything is possible, then any expectation that does not reflect these 
boundary-less characteristics is unrealistic.  
 
MANAGING EXPECTATIONS 
 
The potential damage caused by holding unrealistic expectations comes from how it affe cts the way we 
perceive information. Expectations are mental representations of what some future moment will look, 
sound, taste, smell, or feel like. Expectations co me from what we know. This makes sense, because we 
can't expect something that we have no knowledge or awareness of. What we know is synonymous 
with what we have learned to believe about the ways in which the external environment can express 
itself. What we believe is our own personal version of the truth. When we expect something, we are  
projecting out into the future what we believe to be true.  
We are expecting the outside environment a minute, an hour, a day, a week, or a month from now to be 
the way we have represented it in our minds. We have to be careful about what we project out into the 
future, because nothing else has the potential to create more unhappiness and emotion al misery than an 
unfulfilled expectation. When things happen exactl y as you expect them to, how do you feel? The 
response is generally wonderful (including feelings like happiness, joy, satisfaction, and  a greater sense 
of well-being), unless, of course, you were expecting something dreadful and it manifested itself. 
Conversely, how do you fe el when your expectations are not fulfilled? The universal response is 
emotional pain.  
Everyone experiences some degree of anger, resentment, despair, regret, disappointment, 
dissatisfaction, or betrayal when the environment doesn't turn out to be exactly as we expected it to be 
(unless, of course, we are completely surprised by something much better than we imagined). Here's 
where we run into problems. Because our expectations come from what we know, when we deci de or 
believe that we know something, we naturally expect to be right. At that point, we're no longer in a 
neutral or open state of mind, and it's not difficult to understand why. If we'r e going to feel great if the 
market does what we expect it to do, or feel horrible if it doesn't, then we're not exac tly neutral or open-
minded. Quite the contrary, the force of the belief behind the expectation will cause us to perceive 
market information in a way that confirms what we expect (we naturally like feeling go od); and our 
pain-avoidance mechanisms will shield us from information that doesn't confirm what we expect (to 
keep us from feeling bad).  
As I've already indicated, our minds are designed to help us avoid pain, both phy sical and emotional. 
These pain-avoidance mechanisms exist at both conscious and subconscious levels. For example, if an 
object is coming toward your head, you react instin ctively to get out of the way. Ducking does not 
require a conscious decision-making process. On the other hand, if you clearly see the objec t and have 
time to consider the alternatives, you may decide to catch the object, bat it away with your hand, or 
duck. These are examples of how we protect ourselves from physical pain. Protecting o urselves from 
emotional or mental pain works in the same way, except that we are now protecting ourselves from 
information. For example, the market expresses inform ation about itself and its potential to move in a 
particular direction. If there's a difference between what we want or expect and wh at the market is 
offering or making available, then our pain-avoidance mechanisms kick in to compensate for the 
differences. As with physical pain, these mechanisms operate at both the conscious and subconsciou s 
levels.  
To protect ourselves from painful information at the conscious level, we rationalize, justify, make 
excuses, willfully gather information that will neutra lize the significance of th e conflicting information, 
get angry (to ward off the conflicting information), or just plain lie to ourselves. At the subconscious 
level, the pain-avoidance process is much more subtle and mysterious. At this level, our mi nds may 
block our ability to see other alternatives, even though in other circumstances we would b e able to 
perceive them. Now, because they are in conflict with what we want or expect, our pain-avoidan ce 
mechanisms can make them disappear (as if they didn't exist). To illustrate this phenom enon, the best 
example is one I have already given you: We are in a trade where the market is moving agai nst us. In 
fact, the market has established a trend in the opposite direction to what we want or expect. Ordinarily, 
we would have no problem identifying or perceiving this pattern if it weren't for the fact th at the market 
was moving against our position. But the pattern loses its significance (becomes invisible) becau se we 
find it too painful to acknowledge.  
To avoid the pain, we narrow our focus of attention and concentrate on inform ation that keeps us out of 
pain, regardless of how insignificant or minute. In the meantime, the information that clearly  indicates 
the presence of a trend and the opportunity to trade in the direction of that trend becomes invisible.  The 
trend doesn't disappear from physica l reality, but our ability to per ceive it does. Our pain-avoidance 
mechanisms block our ability to define and interpret what the market is doing as a trend. The trend will 
then stay invisible until the market either reverses in our favor  or we are forced out of the trade because 
the pressure of losing too much money becomes unbearable. It's not until we are either out of the trad e 
or out of danger that the trend becomes apparent, as well as all the opportunities to  make money by 
trading in the  
All the distinctions that would otherwise be perceivable become perfectly clear, after the fact, when 
there is no longer anything for our minds to protect us from. We all have the potential to engage  in self-
protective painavoidance mechanisms, because they're natural functions of the way our m inds operate. 
There may be times when we are protecting ourselve s from information that has the potential to bring 
up deepseated emotional wounds or trauma that we're just not ready to face, or don' t have the 
appropriate skills or resources to d eal with. In these cases, our natura l mechanisms are serving us well. 
But more often, our pain-avoidance mechanisms are just protecting us from information that would 
indicate that our expectations do not correspond with what is available from the environments 
perspective. This is where our pain-avoidance mechanisms do us a disservice, especially as traders. To 
understand this concept, ask yourself what exactly about market information is threatening. Is it 
threatening because the market actually expresses negatively charged information as an inherent 
characteristic of the way it exists? 
It may seem that way, but at the most fundamental level, what the market gives us to perceive are 
uptics and down-tics or up-bars and down-bars. These up and down tics form patterns that represent 
edges. Now, are any of these tics or the patterns they form negatively charged? Agai n, it may certainly 
seem that way, but from the market's perspective the information is neutral. Each up-tic, down-tic, or 
pattern is just information, telling us the market's  position. If any of this information had a negative 
charge as an inherent characteristic of the way it exists, then wouldn't everyone exposed to it 
experience emotional pain? For example, if both you and I get hit on the head with a solid object, there 
probably wouldn't be much difference in how we would feel. We'd both be in pain. Any part of o ur 
bodies coming into contact with a solid object wi th some degree of force will cause anyone with a 
normal nervous system to experience pain.  
We share the experience because our bodies are constructed in basically the same way. The pain is an 
automatic physiological response to the impact with a tangible object. Information in the form of words 
or gestures expressed by the environment, or up and down tics expressed by the marke t, can be just as 
painful as being hit with a solid object; but there's an important difference between information and 
objects. Information is not tangible. Information doesn't consist of atoms and molecules. To experience 
the potential effects of in formation, whether negative or positiv e, requires an interpretation. The 
interpretations we make are functions of our unique mental frameworks. Everyone's me ntal framework 
is unique for two fundamental reasons.  
First, all of us were born with different genetically encoded behavior and personality characte ristics 
that cause us to have different needs from one another. How positively or negatively and t o what 
degree the environment responds to these needs creates experiences unique to each  individual. Second, 
everyone is exposed to a variety of environmental forces. Some of these forces are similar from  one 
individual to the next, but none are exactly the same. If you consider the number of possi ble 
combinations of genetically encoded personality characteristics we can be born with, in relation to the 
almost infinite variety of environmental forces we can encounter throughout our lives, all of which 
contribute to the construction of our mental framewor k, then it's not difficult to see why there is no 
universal mental framework common to everyone.  
Unlike our bodies, which have a common molecular structure that experiences phy sical pain, there is 
no universal mind-set to assure us that we will share the potential negative or positive effects of 
information in the same way. For example, someone could be projecting insults at you, intending to 
cause you to feel emotional pain. From the environment's perspective, this is negatively charged 
information. Will you experience the intended negative  effects? Not necessarily! You have to be able to 
interpret the information as negative to experience it as negative. What if this person is insulting you in 
a language you don't understand, or is using words you don't know the meaning of? Would you feel the 
intended pain? Not until you built a framework to define and understand the words in a deroga tory 
way. Even then, we can't assume that what you'd fe el would correspond to the intent behind the insult. 
You could have a framework to perceive the negative intent, but instead of feel ing pain, you might 
experience a perverse type of pleasure. I've encountered many people who, simply for their own 
amusement, like to get people riled up with negative emotions.  
If they happen to be insulted in the process, it creates a sense of joy because then they know how 
successful they've been. A person expressing genuine love is projecting positively char ged information 
into the environment. Let's say the intent behind th e expression of these positive feelings is to convey 
affection, endearment, and friendship. Are there any assurances that the person or perso ns this 
positively charged information is be ing projected toward will interpret and experience it as such? No, 
there aren't. A person with a very low sense of self-esteem, or someone who experie nced a great deal of 
hurt and disappointment in relationships, will often misinterpret an expressi on of genuine love as 
something else. In the case of a person with low self-esteem, if he doesn't believe he dese rves to be 
loved in such a way, he will find it difficult, if not impossible, to in terpret what he is being offered as 
genuine or real. In the second case, where one has a significant backlog of hurt and disa ppointment in 
relationships, a person could easily come to believe that a genuine expression of love is  extremely rare, 
if not non-existent, and would prob ably interpret the situation either as someone wanting something or 
trying to take advantage of him in some way.  
I'm sure that I don't have to go on and on, sighting examples of all the possible ways there a re to 
misinterpret what someone is trying to communicate to us or how what we express to someone can be 
misconstrued and experienced in ways completely unintended by us. The point that I am making is that 
each individual will define, interpret, and consequently experience whatever information he  is exposed 
to in his own unique way. There's no standardized way to experience what th e environment may be 
offering—whether it's positive, neutral, or nega tive information—simply because there is no 
standardized mental framework in which to perceive information. Consider that, as traders, the market 
offers us something to perceive at each moment. In a sense, you could say that the mark et is 
communicating with us.  
If we start out with the premise that the market does not generate negatively charged information as an 
inherent characteristic of the way it exists, we can then ask, and answer, the question, "What causes 
information to take on a negative quality?" In other words, where exactly does the t hreat of pain come 
from? If it's not coming from the market, then it has to be coming from the way we define and in terpret 
the available information. Defining and interpreting information is a function of what we assume we 
know or what we believe to be true. If what we know or believe is in fact true—and we wouldn't 
b e l i e v e  i t  i f  i t  w e r e n ' t — t h e n  w h e n  w e  p r o j e c t  o u r  b e l i e f s  o u t  i n t o  s o m e  f u t u r e  m o m e n t  a s  a n  
expectation, we naturally expect to be right. When we expect to be right, any infor mation that doesn't 
confirm our version of the truth automatically be comes threatening. Any information that has the 
potential to be threatening also has the potential to be blocked, distorted, or diminished in significance 
by our pain-avoidance mechanisms.  
It's this particular characteristic of the way our minds function that can really do us a di sservice. As 
traders, we can't afford to let our pain-avoidance mechanisms cut us off from what the market is  
communicating to us about what is available in the way of the next opportunity to get in, get out, add 
to, or subtract from a position, just because it's doing something that we don't want or expect. For 
example, when you're watching a market (one you rarely, if ever, trade in) with no intention of doing 
anything, do any of the up or down tics cause you to feel angry, disappointed, frustrated, disillusioned , 
or betrayed in any way? No! The reason is that there's nothing at stake. You're simply observing 
information that tells you where the market is at that moment. If the up and down tics t hat you're 
watching form into some sort of behavior pattern you've learned to identify, don't you readily rec ognize 
and acknowledge the pattern? Yes, for the same reason: There's nothing at stake.  
There is nothing at stake because there's no expectation. You haven't projected what you believe, 
assume, or think you know about that market into some future moment. As a result, there's no thing to 
be either right about or wrong about, so the information has no potential to take on a threaten ing or 
negatively charged quality. With no particular expectation, you haven't placed any bounda ries on how 
the market can express itself. Without any mental b oundaries, you will be making yourself available to 
perceive everything you've learned about the nature of the ways in which the market moves.  
There's nothing for your pain-avoidance mechanisms to exclude, distort, or diminish from  your 
awareness in order to protect you. In my workshops, I always ask participants to resolv e the following 
primary trading paradox: In what way does a trader have to learn how to be rigid an d flexible at the 
same time? The answer is: We have to be rigid in our rules and flexible in our expectat ions. We need to 
be rigid in our rules so that we gain a sense of se lf-trust that can, and will always, protect us in an 
environment that has few, if any, boundaries. We need to be flexible in our expectati ons so we can 
perceive, with the greatest degree of clarity and objectivity, what the market is communicating to us 
from its perspective. At this point, it probably goes without saying that the typical trader does just  the 
opposite: He is flexible in his rules and rigid in his expectations. Interestingly enough, the more rigid 
the expectation, the more he has to either bend, violate, or break his rules in order to accommo date his 
unwillingness to give up what he wants in favor of what the market is offering.  
 
ELIMINATING THE EMOTIONAL RISK 
 
To eliminate the emotional risk of trading, you have to neutralize your expectations  about what the 
market will or will not do at any given moment or in any given situation. You can do this by being 
willing to think from the markets perspective. Re member, the market is always communicating in 
probabilities. At the collective leve l, your edge may look perfect in every respect; but at the individual 
level, every trader who has the potential to act as a force on price movement can negate the pos itive 
outcome of that edge. To think in probabilities, you have to create a mental framew ork or mind-set that 
is consistent with the underlying principles of a probabilistic environment. A probabilistic mind-set 
pertaining to trading consists of five fundamental truths.  
 
1. Anything can happen.  
2. You don't need to know what is going to happen next in order to make money.  
3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an 
edge.  
4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over 
another.  
5. Eveiy moment in the market is unique.  
 
Keep in mind that your potential to experience emotional pain comes from the way you define and 
interpret the information you're exposed to. When you  adopt these five truths, your expectations will 
always be in line with the psychological realities of the market environment. With the appro priate 
expectations, you will eliminate your potential to define and interpret market  information as either 
painful or threatening, and you thereby effectively neutralize the emotional risk of tradin g. The idea is 
to create a carefree state of mind that completely accepts the fact that there are always unknown forces 
operating in the market. When you make these truths a fully functional part of yo ur belief system, the 
rational part of your mind will defend these truths in the same way it defends any other belief you hold 
about the nature of trading.  
This means that, at least at the rational level, your  mind will automatically defend against the idea or 
assumption that you can know for sure what will happen next. It's a contradiction to beli eve that each 
trade is a unique event with an uncertain outcome and random in relationship to any other trade made 
in the past; and at the same time to believe you know for sure what will happen next and to expect to be 
right. If you really believe in an uncertain outcome, then you also have to expect that  virtually anything 
can happen. Otherwise, the moment you let your mind hold onto the notion that you know, you stop 
taking all of the unknown variables into consideration. Your mind won't let you have it both ways. If 
you believe you know something, the moment is no longer unique.  
If the moment isn't unique, then everything is known or knowable; that is, there's nothing  not to know. 
However, the moment you stop factoring in what you don't or can't know about the situation instead of 
being available to perceive what the market is offering, you make yourself susceptible to all of the 
typical trading errors. For example, if you really believed in an uncertain outcome, would you ev er 
consider putting on a trade without defining your risk in advance? Would you ever hesi tate to cut a 
loss, if you really believed you didn't know? What about trading errors like jumping the gun? H ow 
could you anticipate a signal that hasn't yet manifested itself in the market , if you weren't convinced 
that you were going to miss out? Why would you ever let a winning trade turn into  a loser, or not have 
a systematic way of taking profits, if you weren't convinced the market was going your way 
indefinitely? Why would you hesitate to take a trade or not put it on at all, unle ss you were convinced 
that it was a loser when the market was at your original entiy point? Why would you break your money 
management rules by trading too large a position relative to your equity or emotional tolerance to 
sustain a loss, if you weren't positive that you had a sure thing? Finally, if you really believed in a 
random distribution between wins and losses, could you ever feel betrayed by the market? If you 
flipped a coin and guessed right, you wouldn't necessarily expect to be right on the next flip sim ply 
because you were right on the last.  
Nor would you expect to be wrong on the next flip if you were wrong on the last. Because you believe 
in a random distribution between the sequence of heads and tails, your expectations w ould be perfectly 
aligned with the reality of the situation. You would certainly like to be right, and if you were that 
would be great, but if you were wrong then you would not feel betrayed by the flip, because you know 
and accept that there are unknown variables at work that affect the outcome. Unknown means "not 
something your rational thinking process can take into consideration in advance of the Hi-r" ?jXCi> v'L 
^ fu!Iv accept that you don't know As a result, there is little, if any, potential to experience the kind of 
emotional pain that wells up when you feel betrayed. As a trader, when you're expecting  a random 
outcome, you will always be at least a little surprised at whatever the market does— even if it conf orms 
exactly to your definition of an  edge and you end up with a winning trade. However expecting a 
random outcome doesn't mean that you can't use your full reasoning and analytical abilit ies to project 
an outcome, or that you can't guess what's going to happen next, or have a hunch or feeling about it, 
because you can. Furthermore, you can be right in each instance.  
You just can't expect to be right. And if you are right, you can't expect that whatever you did that 
worked the last time will work again the next time, even though the situation may look, sound, o r feel 
exactly the same. Anything that you are perceiving "now" in the market will ne ver be exactly the same 
as some previous experience that exists in your mental environment. But that doesn't mean that your 
mind (as a natural characteristic of the way it functions) won't try to make the two identical. There will 
be similarities between the "now moment" and something that you know from the past, but those 
similarities only give you somethin g to work with by putting the odds of success in your favor. If you 
approach trading from the perspective that you don't  know what will happen next, you will circumvent 
your mind's natural inclination to make the "now moment" identical to some earlier experience.  
As unnatural as it seems to do so, you can't let some previous experience (either negative or extrem ely 
positive) dictate your state of mind. If you do, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to perceive 
what the market is communicating from its perspective. When I put on  a trade, all I expect is that 
something will happen. Regardless of how good I think my edge is, I expect no thing more than for the 
market to move or to express itself in some way.  However, there are some things that I do know for 
sure. I know that based on the markets past behavior, the odds of it moving in the direction of m y trade 
are good or acceptable, at least in relationship to how much I am willing to spend to find out if it does. I 
also know before getting into a trade how much I am willing to let the market move against m y 
position. There is always a point at which the odds of success are greatly diminished in relati on to the 
profit potential. At that point, it's not worth spending any more money to fi nd out if the trade is going 
to work. If the market reaches that point, I know without any doubt, hesitation, or internal conflict that  I 
will exit the trade.  
The loss doesn't create any emotional damage, because I don't interpret the experience ne gatively. To 
me, losses are simply the cost of doing business or the amount of money I need  to spend to make 
myself available for the winning trades. If, on the other hand, the trade turns out to be a  winner, in most 
cases I know for sure at what point I am going to ta ke my profits. (If I don't know for sure, I certainly 
have a veiy good idea.) The best traders are in the "now moment" because there's no stress. Ther e's no 
stress because there's nothing at risk other than the amount of money they are willing to spend on a 
trade. They are not trying to be right or trying to avoid being wrong; neither are they trying to prove 
anything. If and when the market tells them that their edges aren't working or that it's time to take 
profits, their minds do nothing to block this information. They completely accept what th e market is 
offering them, and they wait for the next edge. CHAP

WORKING WITH YOUR BELIEFS 
 
Now the task before you is to properly integrate the five fundamental truths presented in Chapt er 7 in 
your mental environment at a functional level. To help you do that, we will take an in-depth look at 
beliefs—their nature, properties, and characteristics. However, before we do that I will review and  
organize the major concepts presented thus far into a much clearer and more practical framework. What 
you learn from this and the next two chapters w ill form the foundation for understanding everything 
you need to do to achieve your goals as a trader.  
 
DEFINING THE PROBLEM 
 
At the most fundamental level, the market is simply  a series of up and down tics that form patterns. 
Technical analysis defines these patterns as edges. Any particular pattern defined as an  edge is simply 
an indication that there is a higher probability that the market will move in on e direction over the other. 
However, there is a major mental paradox here becau se a pattern implies consistency, or, at least, a 
consistent outcome. But the reality is each pattern is a unique occurre nce. They may look (or measure) 
exactly the same from one occurrence to the next, but the similarities are only on the surface. The  
underlying force behind each pattern is traders, and the traders who contribute to the formation of one 
pattern are always different from the traders who contribute to the next; so the outc ome of each pattern 
is random relative to one another.  
Our minds have an inherent design characteristic (the association mechanism) tha t can make this 
paradox difficult to deal with. Now these edges, or the patterns they represent, flow by in every time 
frame, making the market a never-ending stream of opportunities to get in, get out (scratch a trade), 
take profits, cut losses, or add to or detract from a position. In other words, from the mark et's 
perspective, each moment presents each one of us traders with the opportunity to do something on our 
own behalf.  
 
DEFINING THE TERMS 
 
What prevents us from perceiving each "now moment " as an opportunity to do something for ourselves 
or to act appropriately even when we do? Our fears! What is the source of our fears? We know it s not 
the market, because from the market's perspective, the up and down tics and the patterns they create are 
neither positively or negatively charged.  
As a result, the up and down tics themselves have no capacity to cause us to enter into any particular 
state of mind (negative or positive), lose our objectiv ity, make errors, or take us out of the opportunity 
flow. If it's not the market that causes us to experience a negatively charged state of mind, then  what 
does cause it? The way we define and interpret the information we perceive. If that's the case, then 
what determines what we perceive and how we define and interpret that information? What w e believe 
or what we assume to be true. Our beliefs working in conjunction with the association and pain-
avoidance mechanisms act as a force on our five senses, causing us to perceive, defi ne, and interpret 
market information in a way that is consistent with what we expect. What we expect is synonymous 
with.what we believe or assume to be true. Expectations are beliefs projected into som e future moment.  
Each moment from the market's perspective is uni que; but if the information being generated by the 
market is similar in quality, properties, or character istic to something that is already in our minds, the 
two sets of information (outside and inside) automatically become linked. When this connectio n is 
made, it triggers a state of mind (confidence, euphoria, fear, terror, disappointment, regret, betr ayal, 
etc.) that corresponds to whatever belief, assumption, or memory the outside information was linked. 
This makes it seem as if what is outside is exactly the same as whatever is already inside of us. It's our 
state of mind that makes the truth of whatever we're perceiving outside of us (in the market) seem 
indisputable and beyond question.  
Our state of mind is always the absolute truth. If I feel confident, then I am confident. If I feel afraid, 
then I am afraid. We can't dispute the quality of energy flowing through our mind and body at any 
given moment. And because I know as an indisputable fact how I feel, you could say that I also know 
the truth of what I'm perceiving outside of me in the same moment. The problem is that how we fee l is 
always the absolute truth, but the beliefs that triggered our state of mind or feeling may or m ay not be 
true relative to the possibilities that exist in the market at any given moment. Recall the example of the 
boy and the dog.  
The boy "knew" for an absolute fact that each dog he encountered after the first was threatenin g, 
because of the way he felt when one came into his field of awareness. These other dogs did not c ause 
his fear; his negatively charged memory working in conjunction with the association and his pain -
avoidance mechanism caused his fear. He experienced his own version of the truth, although th at did 
not correspond with the possibilitie s that existed from the environment's perspective. His belief about 
the nature of dogs was limited relative to the possible characteristics and traits expre ssed by dogs. Yet 
the state of mind he experienced eveiy time he encountered a dog caused him to believe thats he 
"knew" exactly what to expect from them.  
This same process causes us to believe that we "know" exactly what to expect from die market, when 
the reality is there are always unknown forces operating at every moment. The trouble is, the instant we 
think we "know" what to expect, we simultaneously  stop taking all the unknown forces and die various 
possibilities created by those forces into consideration. The unknown forces are ot her traders waiting to 
enter or exit trades, based on their beliefs about the future. In other words, we really c an't know exactly 
what to expect from the market, until we can read th e minds of all the traders who have the potential to 
act as a force on price movement. Not a very likely possibility. As traders, we  can't afford to indulge 
ourselves in any form of "I know what to expect from the market." We can "know" exactly what an 
edge looks, sounds, or feels like, and we can "know" exactly how much we need to risk to find o ut if 
that edge is going to work.  
We can "know" that we have a specific plan as to ho w we are going to take profits if a trade works. But 
that's it! If what we think we know starts expanding to what the market is going to do, we're in trouble. 
And all that's required to put us into a negatively charged, "I know what to expect from the market" 
state of mind is for any belief, memoiy, or attitude to cause us to interpret the up and down tics  or any 
market information as anything but an opportunity to do something on our own behalf.  
What Are the Objectives? Ultimately, of course, making money is everyone's objective. But if trading 
were only a matter of making money, reading this book wouldn't be necessary. Putting on a winning 
trade or even a series of winning trades requires absolutely no skill. On the other hand, creating 
consistent results and being able to keep what  we've created does require skill. Making money 
consistently is a by-product of acquiring and mastering certain mental skills. The degr ee to which you 
understand this is the same degree to which you w ill stop focusing on the money and focus instead on 
how you can use your trading as a tool to master these skills.  
What Are the Skills? Consistency is the result of a carefree, objective state of mind, where we are 
making ourselves available to perceive and act upon whatever the market is offering us (from its 
perspective) in any given "now moment."  
What Is a Carefree State of Mind? Carefree means confident, but not euphoric. When you are in a 
carefree state of mind, you won't feel any fear, he sitation, or compulsion to do anything, because 
you've effectively eliminated the potential to define and interpret market information  as threatening. To 
remove the sense of threat, you have to accept the risk completely. When you have accepted the risk, 
you will be at peace with any outcome. To be at peace with any outcome, you must reconcile anything 
in your mental environment that conflicts with th e five fundamental truths about the market. What's 
more, you also have to integrate these truths into your mental system as core beliefs.  
What Is Objectivity? Objectivity is a state of mind where you have conscious access to everything 
you have learned about the nature of market movement. In other words, nothing is being blocked o r 
altered by your painavoidance mechanisms.  
What Does it Mean to Make Yourself Available? Making yourself available means trading from the 
perspective that you have nothing to prove. You aren't trying to win or to avoid losing. You aren't  
trying get your money back or to take revenge on the market. In other words, you come to the marke t 
with no agenda other than to let it unfold in any way that it chooses and to be in the best state of mind 
to recognize and take advantage of the opportunities it makes available to you.  
What Is the "Now Moment'? Trading in the "now moment" means that there is no potential to 
associate an opportunity to get into, get out of, add too, or detract from a trade with a past experience 
that already exists in your mental environment.  
 
HOW THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS RELATE TO THE SKILLS 
 
1. Anything can happen. Why? Because there are always unknown forces operating in every market at 
every moment, it takes only one trader somewhere in the world to negate the positive outcome of your 
edge. That's all: only one. Regardless of how much time, effort, or money you've  invested in your 
analysis, from the market's perspective there are no ex ceptions to this truth. Any exceptions that may 
exist in your mind will be a source of conflict and potentially cause you to perceive market info rmation 
as threatening.  
2. You don't need to know what is going to happen next in order to make money. Why? Because 
there is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an 
edge. (See number 3.) In other words, based on the past performance of your edge, yo u may know that 
out of the next 20 trades, 12 will be winners and 8 will be losers. What you don't know is the sequence 
of wins and losses or how much money the market is going to make available on the winning trades. 
This truth makes trading a probability or numbers game.  
When you really believe that trading is simply a probability game, concepts like right and wrong or win 
and lose no longer have the same significance. As a result, your expectations will be in harmo ny with 
the possibilities. Keep in mind that nothing has mo re potential to cause em otional discord than our 
unfulfilled expectations. Emotional pain is the unive rsal response when the outside world expresses 
itself in a way that doesn't reflect what we expect or believe to be true. As a result, any ma rket 
information that does not confirm our expectations is automatically defined and interpreted as  
threatening. That interpretation causes us to adopt a negatively charged, defensive state of mind, wh ere 
we end up creating the very experience we are trying to avoid. Market information is only threatening 
if you are expecting the market to do something for you.  
Otherwise, if you don't expect the market to make you right, you have no reason to be afraid of being 
wrong. If you don't expect the market to make you a winner, you have no reason to be afraid of losing. 
If you don't expect the market to keep going in your direction indefinitely, there is no reas on to leave 
money on the table. Finally, if you don't expect to be able to take advantage of every oppo rtunity just 
because you perceived it and it presented itself, you have no reason to be afraid of missing out. On  the 
other hand, if you believe that all you need to know is:  
1. the odds are in your favor before you put on a trade;  
2. how much it's going to cost to find out if the trade is going to work;  
3. you don't need to know what's going to happen next to make money on that trade; and   
4. anything can happen;  
Then how can the market make you wrong? What information could the marke t generate about itself 
that would cause your pain-avoidance mechanisms to kick in so that you exclude that information fro m 
your awareness? None that I can think of.  
If you believe that anything can happen and that you don't need to know wh at is going to happen next 
to make money, then you will always be right. Your expectations will always be in harmony with the  
conditions as they exist from the market's perspective, effectively neutralizing your potential to 
experience emotional pain. By the same token, how can a losing trade or even a ser ies of losers have 
the typical negative effect, if you really believe that trading is a probability or numbers game? If your 
edge puts the odds in your favor, then every loss puts you that much closer to a win. When you really 
believe this, your response to a losing trade will no longer take on a negative emotio nal quality.  
3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define 
an edge. 
 If every loss puts you that much closer to a win, you will be looking forward to the next occurrence of 
your edge, ready and waiting to jump in without the slightest reservation or hesitatio n. On the other 
hand, if you still believe that trading is about analysis or about being right, then after a l oss you will 
anticipate the occurrence of your next edge with trepidation, wondering if it's going  to work. This, in 
turn, will cause you to start gather ing evidence for or against the trad e. You will gather evidence for the 
trade if your fear of missing out is greater than yo ur fear of losing. And you will gather information 
against the trade if your fear of losing is greater than your fear of miss ing out. In either case, you will 
not be in the most conducive state of mind to produce consistent results.  
4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over 
another.  
Creating consistency requires that you completely accept that trading isn't about hoping, wondering, or 
gathering evidence one way or the other to determine if the next trade is going to work. The only 
evidence you need to gather is whether the variables you use to define an edge are prese nt at any given 
moment. When you use "other" information, outside the parameters of your edge to decide wheth er you 
will take the trade, you are adding random variables to your trading regime. 
Adding random variables makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine wh at works and 
what doesn't. If you're never certain about the viab ility of your edge, you won' t feel too confident about 
it. To whatever degree you lack confidence, you will experience fear. The irony is, you will be afraid of 
random, inconsistent results, without realizing that your random, inconsistent approach is creati ng 
exactly what you are afraid of. On the other hand, if you believe that an edge is simply a higher 
probability of one thing happening over another, and there's a random distribution between wins and 
losses for any given set of variables that define an edge, why would you gather "other" evidence f or or 
against a trade? To a trader operating out of these two beliefs, gathering "other" evide nce wouldn't 
make any sense.  
Or let me put it this way: Gathering "other" evidence makes about as much sense as trying to determine 
whether the next flip of a coin will be heads, after the last ten flips came up tails. Regardless of what 
evidence you find to support heads coming up, there is still a 50-percent chance that the next flip wi ll 
come up tails. By the same token, regardless of how much evidence you gather to support acting or not 
acting on a trade, it still only take s one trader somewhere in the world to negate the validity of any, if 
not all, of your evidence. The point is why bother! If the market is offering you a legitimate edge, 
determine the risk and take the trade.  
5. Every moment in the market is unique.  
Take a moment and think about the concept of uniqueness. "Unique" means not  like anything else that 
exists or has ever existed. As much as we may understand the concept of uniqueness, our minds don't 
deal with it very well on a practical level. As we have already discussed, our mind s are hardwired to 
automatically associate (without conscious awareness) anything in the exterior environment that is 
similar to anything that is already inside of us in the form of a memory, belief, or attitude. This creates 
an inherent contradiction between the way we naturally think about the world and the way the world 
exists. No two moments in the external environment will ever exactly duplicate themselves. To do so, 
every atom or every molecule would have to be in the exact same position they were in so me previous 
moment.  
Not a very likely possibility. Yet, based on the way our minds are designed to process information, we 
will experience the "now moment" in the environment as being exactly the same as  some previous 
moment as it exists inside our minds. If each moment is like no other, then there's nothing at the level 
of your rational experience that can tell you for sure that you "know" what will happen next. So I will 
say again, why bother trying to know?! When you try to know, you are, in essence, trying to be right. I 
am not implying here that you can't predict what the market will do next and be right,  because you 
most certainly can. It's in the trying that you run into all of the problems. If you believe that you 
correctly predicted the market once, you will naturally try to do it again.  
As a result, your mind will automatically start sca nning the market for the sa me pattern, circumstance, 
or situation that existed the last time you correctl y predicted its movement. When you find it, your state 
of mind will make it seem as if everything is exactly  as it was the last time. The problem is that, from 
the market's perspective, it is not the same. As a result, you are setting yourse lf up for disappointment. 
What separates the best traders from all the rest is that they have trained their minds to believe in  the 
uniqueness of each moment (although this training usually takes the form of losing several fortunes 
before they "really" believe in the concept of uniq ueness). This belief acts as a counteracting force, 
neutralizing the automatic association mechanism. When you truly believe that each moment is un ique, 
then by definition there isn't anything in your mind for the association mechanism to li nk that moment 
to. This belief acts as an internal force causing you to disassociate the "now" moment in the market 
from any previous moment filed away in your mental environment. The stronger your belief in the 
uniqueness of each moment, the lower your poten tial to associate. The lower your potential to 
associate, the more open your mind will be to perceive what the market is  offering you from its 
perspective.  
 
MOVING TOWARD "THE ZONE" 
 
When you completely accept the ps ychological realities of the market, you will correspondingly accept 
the risks of trading. When you accept the risks of trading, you eliminate the potential to define mark et 
information in painful ways. When you stop defining  and interpreting market information in painful 
ways, there is nothing for your mind to avoid, nothing to protect against.  
When there's nothing to protect against, you will ha ve access to all that you know about the nature of 
market movement. Nothing will get blocked, which means you will perceive all the possibilities you 
have learned about (objectively), and since your mind is open to a true exchange of energy , you will 
quite naturally start discovering other possibilities (edges) that you former ly couldn't perceive. For your 
mind to be open to a true exchange of energy, you can't be in a state of knowing or belie ving that you 
already know what's going to happen next. When you are at peace with not knowing what's going to 
happen next, you can interact with the market from a perspective where you will be making yo urself 
available to let the market tell you, from its perspective, what is likely to happen next. At that point, 
you will be in the best state of mind to spontaneously enter "the zone," where  you are tapped into the 
"now moment opportunity flow." CHAPTER 9  
 
CHAPTER 9  
 
THE NATURE OF BELIEFS 
 
At this point, if you can sense the benefits of adopting the five fundamental truths a bout trading, then 
the task is to learn how to properly integrate these tr uths into your mental system as core beliefs that 
are not in conflict with any other beliefs you may hold. At first glance, this may seem like a dau nting 
task and under other circumstances I would agree with you, but it won't be, because in Chapter 11  I'll 
give you a simple trading exercise specifically designed to properly install these truths as beliefs at a 
functional level.  
A functional level is, one where you find yourself just naturally operating out of  a carefree state of 
mind, perceiving exactly what you need to do and doing it without hesitation or internal co nflict. 
However, I do have a word of caution for those of you who have already looked at  the exercise. On the 
surface, the trading exercise looks so simple that  you may be tempted to do it now, before you 
thoroughly understand the implications of what you are doing. I strongly suggest that  you reconsider. 
There are some subtle yet profound dynamics involved in the process of learning how to install new 
beliefs and change any existing beliefs that are in conflict with the new ones. Understanding the trading 
exercise itself is easy. Understanding how to use the exercise to change your be liefs is another matter 
entirely. If you do the exercise without understanding the concepts presented in this chapter and the 
next, you will not achieve the desired results. It is also important that you n ot take for granted the 
amount of mental effort you may have to expend to train your mind to fully ac cept these principles of 
success, regardless of how well you understand them. Remember Bob, the CTA who believed he 
thoroughly understood the concept of probabilities, but didn't have the ability to function from  a 
probabilistic perspective. Many people make the mistake of assuming that once they under stand 
something, the insight inherent in their new understanding automatically becomes a functional part of 
their identity.  
Most of the time, understanding a concept is only a fi rst step in the process of integrating that concept 
at a functional level. This is especially true of co ncepts that deal with diinking in probabilities. Our 
minds are not naturally wired to be "objective" or to stay in the "now moment." This means we have to 
actively train our minds to think from these perspectiv es. In addition to the training involved, there may 
be any number of conflicting belie fs to work through. Conflicting beliefs will have the effect of 
sabotaging your best intentions to operate from an objective state of mind or to experience the "now 
moment opportunity flow." For example, let's say you've spent years learning how to rea d the markets, 
or spent large sums of money developing or buying technical systems, just so you could find out what 
was going to happen next.  
Now you have come to understand that you don't have to know what's going to  happen next, and that 
even trying to know will detract from your ability to be objective or to stay in the moment. What we 
have is a direct conflict between your old belief that you need to know what will happen next to be 
successful and your new understanding that you don't need to know. Now, will your new understanding 
suddenly neutralize all the time, money, and energy expended on reinforc ing the belief that you "need 
to know"? I wish it were that easy. And for some lu cky few, it may be. If you will recall in Chapter 4 
when I talked about psychological distance in relati onship to software code, I said that some traders 
may already be so close to these new perspectives that all they need is to put together a few of the  
missing pieces to create a mindaltering, "ah, ha" experience. However, based on my experience of 
working with well over a thousand traders, I can say that most are not close to these perspectives at all. 
For those of you who are not, it may take a considerable amount of mental work (over a cons iderable 
amount of time) to properly integrate your new understandings about trading into your mental 
environment.  
The good news is that, ultimately, the exercise I pres ent in Chapter 11 will in stall the five fundamental 
truths and resolve many of the potential conflicts, but only if you know exactly what you a re doing and 
why you are doing it. That is the subject of this and the next chapter.  
 
THE ORIGINS OF A BELIEF 
 
What can we learn about the nature of beliefs, and how can we use that knowledge to create a mind-set 
that fosters our desire to be a consistently successful trader? These are the two questions I am going to 
focus on answering in this chapter. First, let's look at the origin of our beliefs. As you may recall, 
memories, distinctions, and beliefs exist in the form of energy— specifically, structured energy. 
Earlier, I lumped these three mental components together  to illustrate:  
 
1. that memories, distinctions, and beliefs do not exist as physical matter;  
2. that the cause-and-effect relationship that exists between ourselves and the external environment 
brings these components into existence; and  
3. how the cause-and-effect relationship reverses so that we can perceive in the external environment 
what we have learned about.  
 
To get at the origins of our beliefs, we're going to have to unbundle these comp onents to illustrate the 
difference between a memory and a belief. The best way to do this is to imagine ourselves in the mind 
of an infant. I would think that at the very beginning of a child's life, the memories  of his experiences 
would exist in their purest form. By that I mean that the memories of what he has seen, heard, smelled, 
touched, or tasted exist in his mind as pure sensory information that is not organized or attached to any 
specific words or concepts. Therefore, I am going to define a pure memory as sensory informa tion 
stored in its original form. A belief, on the other hand, is a concept about th e nature of the way the 
external environment expresses itself.  
A concept combines pure sensory information with a symbol system we call language. For ex ample, 
most infants have a pure memory of how it feels to be lovingly nurtured by a parent, but  it isn't until the 
infant is taught to link or associate certain words with the pure sensory information stored in his 
memory that he will form a concept about how it feels to be lovingly nurtured. The phrase "Life is 
wonderful" is a concept. By themselves, the word s make up a meaningless collection of abstract 
symbols. But if a child is either taught or deci des to connect these words to his positively charged 
feelings of being nurtured, then the letters are no longer a collection of abstract symbols and the words 
are no longer an abstract phrase. "Life is wonderful" becomes a definitive distinction about the nature 
of existence or the way the world works. By the same token, if the child didn't get eno ugh nurturing, 
relative to his needs, he could just as easily link his feelings of emotional pain to a conce pt like "Life 
isn't fair" or "The world is an awful place." In an y case, when the positive or negative energy from our 
memories or experiences become linked to a set of words we call a concept, the concept becomes 
energized and, as a result, is transformed into a belief about the nature of reality. If you consider t hat 
concepts are structured by the framework of a language and energized by our exp eriences, it becomes 
clear why I refer to beliefs as "structured energy."  
When a belief comes into existence, what does it do? What is its function? In some ways it seems 
ludicrous to ask those questions. After all, we all ha ve beliefs. We are constantly expressing our beliefs 
both verbally and through our actions. Furthermore, we are constantly interacting with other peoples 
beliefs as they express them. Yet, if I ask, "What exactly does a belief do?" chances are your mind will 
go blank. On the other hand, if I were to ask about the functions of your eyes, ears, nose, or teeth, you 
would have no problem answering. Since beliefs are such important component parts of o ur make-up 
(in terms of their impact on the quality of our lives), it  certainly has to be one of life's great ironies that 
they are also the least thought about and understood. What I mean by "least thought about" is, if we 
have a problem with one of our body parts, we naturally focus our attention on that part and think ab out 
what we need to do to fix the problem.  
However, it doesn't necessarily occur to us that the problems we may be having with  the quality of our 
lives (for example, lack of happiness, a sense of dissatisfaction, or lack of success in some area) are 
rooted in our beliefs. This lack of consideration is a universal phenomenon. One of the prominent 
characteristics of beliefs is that they make what we experience seem self evident and beyond question. 
In fact, if it weren't for your intense desire to experience consistent success as a trader,  it's unlikely you 
would be delving into this topic at all. Usually, it takes years of extreme frustrati on before people begin 
examining their beliefs as the source of their difficulties. However, even though beliefs are an intricate 
part of our identity, you don't have to take this process of self analysis so personally. Co nsider the fact 
that none of us was born with any of our beliefs. They were all acquired in a combination of ways. 
Many of the beliefs that have the most profound impact on our lives were not even acq uired by us as an 
act of free will. They were instilled by other people.  
And it probably won't come as a surprise to anyone  that usually the beliefs that cause us the most 
difficulty are those that were acquired from others without our conscious conse nt. By that I mean 
beliefs that we acquired when we were too young and uninformed to realize the negative implications 
of what we were being taught. Regardless of the source of our beliefs, once they are born into exis tence 
they all basically function in the same way. Beliefs have certain characteristic ways in which they do 
their jobs, not unlike the various parts of our bodies.  
For example, if you compare my eyes and your eyes, or my hands and your hands,  or my red blood 
cells and your red blood cells, we can see that they are not exactly the same, but they have 
characteristics in common that cause them to function in similar ways. By the same token, a belief that 
"Life is wonderful" will perform its function in the same way as a belief that "Life is awful." The 
beliefs themselves are different and the effect that each has on the quality of the holder's life will be  
vastly different, but both beliefs will function in exactly the same manner.  
 
BELIEFS AND THEIR IMPACT ON OUR LIVES 
 
 In the broadest sense, our beliefs shape the way we experience our lives. As I have al ready said, we're 
not born with any of our beliefs. They're acquired, an d as they accumulate, we  live our lives in a way 
that reflects what we have learned to believe. Consider how different your life would be if you had 
been born into a culture, religion, or political system  that has very little, if anything, in common with 
the one you were born into. It might be hard to imagine, but what you would have learned to believe  
about the nature of life and how the world works ma y not be remotely similar to what you currently 
believe. Yet you would hold these other beliefs with the same degree of certainty as your curre nt 
beliefs.  
 
How Beliefs Shape Our Lives 
 
1. They manage our perception and interpretation of environmental information in a way that is 
consistent with what we believe.  
2. They create our expectations. Keep in mind that an expectation is a belief projected into some future 
moment. Since we can't expect something we don't know about, we could also say that an e xpectation 
is what we know projected into some future moment.  
3. Anything we decide to do or any outward expression of behavior will be consistent with what we 
believe.  
4. Finally, our beliefs shape how we feel  about the results of our actions.  
 
There isn't much about the way we function that beliefs don't play a major role in. So what I am going 
to do now is give you an example I used in my first book, The Disciplined Trader, to illustrate the 
various functions of a belief. In the spring of 1987, I was watching a locally produced television  
program called "Gotcha Chicago." It was about some local celebrities who played practical jokes on 
one another. In one segment of the program, the TV station hired a man to stand on the sidewalk along 
Michigan Avenue holding a sign that read "Free money. Today only." (For those of you who are not 
familiar with Chicago, Michigan Avenue is home to many fashionable, exclusive department  stores and 
boutiques.) The TV station gave the man a considerable amount of cash, with instructions to give 
money to anyone who asked for it.  
Now, when you consider that Michigan Avenue is one of the busiest areas of the city, and if we assume 
that most of the people who passed the man on the street could read the sign, how many people would 
you think took him up on his offer and asked for some money? Of all the people who walked by and 
read the sign, only one person stopped, and said, "Great! May I have a quarter to buy a bus tra nsfer?" 
Otherwise, no one would even go near the man. Eventually, the man grew frustrated because people 
weren't reacting the way he expected them to. He started crying out, "Do you want any money? Pl ease 
take my money; I can't give it away fast enough." Everyone just kept walking around him as if he didn' t 
exist. In fact, I noticed that several people went out of their way to avoid him.  
As a man wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase approached, he went right up to him a nd said, "Would 
you like some money?" The man responded, "Not today." Really frustrated now, h e shot back, "How 
many days does this happen? Would you please take this?" as he tried to hand the man some cash. The 
man responded with a terse "No" and walked on. What was going on here? Why wouldn't anyone 
(except for the person who needed a bus transfer) ask for the money? If we assume that most or all of 
the passersby could read the sign, but still didn't make any effort to get the money, then one possible 
explanation for their behavior is that they just didn't care about money.  
This is extremely unlikely, though , considering how much of our lives is devoted to the pursuit of 
money. If we agree that people could read the sign and that money is very important to  most of us, then 
what could have stopped these people from helping themselves? The environment was making 
available an experience that most people would love to have: someone giving them money with no 
strings attached. Yet everyone walked by, oblivious to what was awaiting them. They must not have 
been able to perceive what was available. That's hard to imagine, because the sign clearly stated "Free 
money. Today only." However, it's not hard to imagine if you consider that most people have a belief  
(an energized concept about how the world works) that "Free money doesn't exist." If free money really 
doesn't exist, then how does someone reconcile the obvious contradiction between that belief and the 
sign saying that it does? That's easy, just decide the man with the sign is crazy; what else could account 
for such bizarre behavior if, in fact, free money doesn't exist? The  reasoning process that could 
compensate for the contradiction might go something like this: "Everyone kn ows getting money with 
no strings attached rarely happens.  
Certainly not from a stranger on one of the busiest st reets in the city. In fact, if the man were really 
giving away money, he would already be mobbed. He might even be endangering his life. He must b e 
crazy. I had better take a wide path around him; who knows what he might do?" Notice that every 
component of the thought process described is consistent with the belief that free money doesn't exist.  
1. The words "free money" were neither perceived nor interpreted as they were intended from the  
environment s perspective.  
2. Deciding the person with the sign must be crazy created an expectation of danger, or a t least a 
perception that caution was warranted.  
3. Purposefully altering one's path to avoid the person  with the sign is an action that is consistent with 
the expectation of danger.  
4. How did each person feel about the outcome?  
That's difficult to say without knowing each person individually, but a good generalization would be 
that they felt relieved that they successfully avoide d an encounter with a crazy person. The feeling of 
relief that resulted from avoiding a confrontation is a state of mind. Remember that how we feel (the 
relative degree of positively or negatively charged energy flowing through our bodies and  minds) is 
always the absolute truth.  
But the beliefs that prompt any particular state of  mind may not be the truth with respect to the 
possibilities available from the environment's perspective. Relief from confrontation was n ot the only 
possible outcome in this situation. Imagine how different the experienc e would be if they believed that 
"free money exists." The process described above would be the same, except it would make the belief 
that "free money exists," seem self-evident and beyond question, just as it made the belief th at "free 
money doesn't exist," seem self-evident and beyond question. A perfect example would be the one 
person who said "great, may I have a quarter for a bus transfer." When I saw this, I had the anybody for 
a quarter. A panhandler is someone who definitely believes in the existence of free money. The refore, 
his perception and interpretation of the sign were exactly what was intende d by the TV station.  
His expectation and behavior were consistent with his belief that free money ex ists. And how would he 
feel about the results? He got his quarter, so I would assume he felt a sense of satisf action. Of course, 
what he didn't know is that he could have gotten a lot more. There's another possible outcom e for our 
scenario. Let's look at a hypothetical example of someone who believes that "free money doesn't exist," 
but who takes a "what if approach to the situation. In other words, some people can be so intrigued and 
curious about the possibilities that they decide to  temporarily suspend thei r belief that "free money 
doesn't exist." This temporary suspension allows them to act outside the boundaries created by a belief, 
in order to see what happens.  
So instead of ignoring the man with the sign, which would be our hypothetical person’s first 
inclination, he walks up to him and says, "Give me ten dollars." The man promptly pulls a ten-dol lar 
bill out of his pocket and gives it to him. What happens now? How does he feel, having exper ienced 
something unexpected that completely contradicted his belief? For most people, the be lief that free 
money doesn't exist is acquired through unpleasant circumstances, to put it mildly. The most com mon 
way is being told that we can't have something because it's too expensive.  
How many times does the typical child hear, "Who do you think you are anyway? Mo ney doesn't grow 
on trees, you know." In other words, it is probably a negatively charged belief. So the experience of 
having money handed to him with no strings attached and without any negative comments would likely 
create a state of mind of pure elation. In fact, most pe ople would be so happy that they'd feel compelled 
to share that happiness and this new discovery with everyone they knew. I can imagine him going bac k 
to his office or going home, and the moment he encounters someone he knows, the first words out of 
his mouth will be “You won’t beli eve what happened to me today, " and even though he desperately 
wants those he meets to believe his story, they probably won't. Why? Because their belief that free 
money doesn't exist will cause them to interpret his story in a way that negates its validity.  
To take this example a little further, imagine what would happen to this person's state of mind if it 
occurred to him that he could have asked for more money. He is in a state of pure elation. However, the 
moment the thought either pops into his mind or someone he relates his story to offers th e idea that he 
could have asked for a lot more money, his state of  mind will immediately shift to a negatively charged 
state of regret or despair. Why? He tapped into a negatively charged belief about w hat it means to miss 
out on something or not get enough. As a result, instead of being happy over what he got, he will 
lament what he could have had but didn't get.  
 
BELIEFS VS. THE TRUTH 
 
In all three of these examples (including the hypothetical one), everybody experienced their own 
unique version of the situation. If asked, each person would describe what he or she experien ced from 
their perspective, as if it were the only true and valid version of the reality of the situation. The 
contradiction between these three versions of the truth suggests to me a larger philosophical issue that 
needs to be resolved. If beliefs limit our awareness of the information being generated by the physical 
environment, so that what we perceive is consistent with whatever we believe, then how do we know 
what the truth is? To answer this question, we have to consider four ideas:  
1. The environment can express itself in an infinite combination of ways. When you combine all the 
forces of nature interacting with everything created by humans, then add to that the forces generated by 
all the possible ways people can express themselves, the result is a number of possible versions of 
reality that would surelv overwhelm even the most onen-minded nerson. 
2. Until we have acquired the ability to perceive eveiy possible way in which the enviro nment can 
express itself, our beliefs will always represent a limited version of what is possible from the 
environment's perspective, making our beliefs a statement about reality, but not necessarily a definitive 
statement of reality.  
3. If you find yourself taking exception to the second statement, then consider tha t if our beliefs were a 
true, 100-percent accurate reflection of physical reality, then our expectations wo uld always be 
fulfilled. If our expectations were always fulfilled, we would be in a perpetual state of satisfaction.  
How could we feel other than happy, joyful, elated, and with a complete sense of well-being if  physical 
reality was consistently showing up exactly as we expected it to?  
4. If you can accept the third statement as being valid, then the corollary is also true. If we are n ot 
experiencing satisfaction, then we must be operating out of a belief or beliefs that don't vork ver y well 
relative to the environmental conditions. we Taking  these four ideas into consideration, I can now 
answer the question, "What is the truth?" The answer is, whatever works. If beliefs  impose limitations 
on what we perceive as possible, and the environment can express itself in an infinite combin ation of 
ways, then beliefs can only be true relative to what we are attempting to accomplish at any given 
moment. In other words, the relative degree of truth inherent in our beliefs can be measured by how 
useful they are. Each of us has internally generated forces (curiosity, needs, wants, desires, goals, and 
aspirations) that compel or motivate us to interact with the physical environment. The particular set of 
steps we take to fulfill the object of our curiosity, needs, wants, desires, goals, or aspirations is a 
function of what we believe to be true in any given circumstance or situation. That tru th, whatever it is, 
will determine:  
 
1. the possibilities we perceive in relation to what  is available from the environment's perspective,  
2. how we interpret what we perceive,  
3. the decisions we make,  
4. our expectations of the outcome,  
5. the action we take, and  
6. how we feel about the results of our efforts.  
 
At any given moment, if we find ourselves in a state of satisfaction, happiness, or well-being in relati on 
to whatever we are attempting to accomplish, we can say that our truth (meaning whatever beliefs w e 
are operating from) are useful because the process, as stated above, worked. What we perceived was 
not only consistent with our objective, it was al so consistent with what was available from the 
environment's perspective. Our interpretation of the information we perceived resulted in a decisi on, 
expectation, and action that were in harmony with the environmental situation and circumstance. Ther e 
was no resistance or counteracting force offered by the environment (or in our own mind) that would 
diminish the outcome we were trying to achieve. As a result, we find ourselves in a state of sa tisfaction, 
happiness, and well-being.  
On the other hand, if we find ourselves in a state of dissatisfaction, disappointm ent, frustration, 
confusion, despair, regret, or hopelessness, we can say that relative to the environmental situation and 
circumstances, the beliefs we are operating from don't work well or at all, and therefore are not useful. 
Simply put, the truth is a function of whatever works in  relation to what we are trying to accomplish at 
any given moment. CHAPTER  
CHAPTER 10  
 
THE IMPACT OF BELIEFS ON TRADING 
 
If the external environment can express itself in an infinite combination of ways, then there's really no 
limit to the number and types of beliefs available to be acquired about the nature of our existence. That 
is an elaborate way of saying that there's a lot out there to be learned about. Yet, to make a general 
observation about the nature of humanity, I would say that we certainly don't live our lives in a ma nner 
that is consistent with that statement. If it's true that it's possible to believe almost anything, then why 
are we always arguing and fighting with each other? Why isn't it all right for all of us to expres s our 
lives in a way that reflects what we have learned to believe? There has to be something behind ou r 
relentless attempt to convince others of the validity of our beliefs and to deny the validity  of theirs. 
Consider that every conflict, from the smallest to th e largest, from the least to the most significant, 
whether between individuals, cultures, societies, or nations, is always the result of conflicting belief s. 
What characteristics of our beliefs make us intolerant of divergent beliefs?  
In some cases, we are so intolera nt that we are willing to kill each other to get our point across. My 
personal theory is that beliefs are not only structured energy, but also energy that seems to be 
conscious, at least to the extent of having some degree of awareness.  
Otherwise, how can we account for our ability to recognize on the outside what is  on the inside? How 
would we know our expectations are being fulfilled? How would we know when they are not? How 
would we know we are being confronted with information or circumstances that cont radict what we 
believe? The only explanation I have is that each individual belief has to have s ome quality of either 
awareness or self-awareness that causes it to function as it does.  
The idea of energy that has some degree of awareness may be difficult for many of you to accept. But 
there are several observations we can make about our individual and collective natures that support die 
possibility. First, everyone wants to be believed. It doesn't matter what the belief is; the experience of 
being believed feels good. I think these positive feelings are universal, meaning that they apply t o 
everyone. Conversely, no one likes to be disbelieved; it doesn't feel good. If I said,  "I don't believe 
you," the negative feeling that would resonate throughout your body and mind is also universal. By the 
same token, none of us likes to have our beliefs challenged. The challenge feels like an  attack. 
Everyone, regardless of the belief, seems to respond in the same way: The typica l response is to argue, 
defend ourselves (our beliefs), and, depending on the situation, attack back. When expressing 
ourselves, we seem to like being listened to. If we sense our audience isn't paying  attention, how does it 
feel? Not good! Again, I think th is response is universal.  
Conversely, why is it so difficult to be a good listener? Because to be a good listener, we actually have 
to listen, without thinking about how we are going to express ourselves the moment we can either 
politely or rudely interrupt the person who's speaking. What's the compelling force beh ind our inability 
to listen without waiting to interrupt? Don't we like being with people with similar beliefs, because it 
feels comfortable and secure? Don't we avoid people with dissimilar or conflicting beliefs, because it 
feels uncomfortable or even threatening? The bottom line implication is, the moment we acquire a 
belief, it seems to take on a life of its own, causing us to recognize and be attracted to its  likeness and 
repelled by anything that is opposite or contradictory.  
Considering the vast number of divergent beliefs that exist, if these feelings of attraction or c omfort 
and being repelled or threatened are universal, then each belief must somehow be conscious of  its 
existence, and this conscious, structured energy must behave in characteristic  ways that are common to 
all of us.  
 
THE PRIMARY CHARACTERISTICS OF A BELIEF 
 
There are three basic characteristics you need to understand in order to effectively install the  five 
fundamental truths about trading at a functional level in your mental environment:  
 
1. Beliefs seem to take on a life of their own and,  therefore, resist any force that would alter their 
present form.  
2. All active beliefs demand expression.  
3. Beliefs keep on working regardless of whether or not we are consciously aware of their ex istence in 
our mental environment.  
 
1. Beliefs resist any force that would alter their present form. We may not understand the underlying 
dynamics of how beliefs maintain their structural in tegrity, but we can observe that they do so, even 
in the face of extreme pressure or force. Throughout human history, there are many examples of 
people whose belief in some issue or cause was so powerful that they chose to endure indignities, 
torture, and death rather than express themselves in a way that violated their beliefs. This is certainly 
a demonstration of just how powerful beliefs can be and the degree to which they can resi st any 
attempt to be altered or violated in the slightest way.  
Beliefs seem to be composed of a type of energy or force that naturally resists any other force that 
would cause them to exist in any form other than their nresent form. Does this mean that th ev can't 
be altered? Absolutely not! It just means that we have to understand how to work with them . Beliefs 
can be altered, but not in the way that most people may think. I believe that once a belief ha s been 
formed, it cannot be destroyed. In other words, there is nothing we can do tha t would cause one or 
more of our beliefs to cease to exist or to evaporate as if they never existed at all. This assertion is 
founded in a basic law of physics. According to Albert Einstein and others in the scientific 
community, energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be transformed.  
If beliefs are energy—structured, conscious energy that is aware of its existence—then this same 
principle of physics can be applied to beliefs, meaning, if we tiy to eradicate them, it's not going to 
work. If you knew someone or something was trying to destroy you, how would you  respond? You 
would defend yourself, fight back, and possibly become even stronger than you were before you 
knew of the threat. Each individual belief is a component of what we cons ider to be our identity. 
Isn't it reasonable to expect that, if threatened, each individual belief would respond in a way that 
was consistent with how all the parts respond collectiv ely? The same principle holds true if we tiy to 
act as if a particularly troublesome belief doesn't exist. If you woke up one morning and everyone 
you knew ignored you and acted as if you didn't exist, how would you respond? It proba bly wouldn't 
be long before you grabbed someone and got right in their face to try to force t hem to acknowledge 
you. Again, if purposely ignored, each individual belief will act in the very same way. It will find a 
way to force its presence into our conscious thought process or behavior. The easiest an d most 
effective way to work with our belie fs is to gently render them inactive or nonfunctional by drawing 
the energy out of them. I call this process de-activation. After de-activation, the original structure of 
the belief remains intact, so technically it hasn't changed. The difference is that the belief no longer 
has any energy. Without energy, it doesn't have the potential to act as a force on our perce ption of 
information or on our behavior. Here is a personal illustration:  
As a young child, I was taught to believe in both Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy. In my mental 
system, both of these are perfect examples of what are now inactive, nonfunctional beliefs. 
However, even though they are inactive, they st ill exist inside my mental system, only now they 
exist as concepts with no energy. If you recall from the last chapter, I defined beliefs as a 
combination of sensory experience and words that form an energized concept. The energy can be 
drawn out of the concept, but the concept itself remains intact, in its original form. However, 
without energy, it no ! T.gCI h-15 th? nOt?ptial to act on my perception of inforlYiation or on my 
behavior. So, as I'm sitting here typing into my computer, if someone came up to me  and said that 
Santa Claus was at the door, how do you think I would define and interpret this inform ation? I 
would treat it as being irrelevant or a joke, of course. However, if I were five years old and my 
mother told me that Santa Claus was at the front door, her words would have instantly tapp ed me 
into a huge reservoir of positively charged energy that would have compelled me to jump up and run 
to the front door as fast as I could.  
Nothing would have been able to stop me. I would have overcome any obstacle in my path. At some 
point, my parents told me Santa Claus didn't exist. Of course, my first reaction was disbelief. I didn't 
believe them, nor did I want to believe them. Eventually, they convinced me. However, the process 
of convincing me did not destroy my belief in Santa Claus or cause it not to exist any longer; it just 
took all the energy out of the belief. The belief was transformed into a nonfunctional, inactive 
concept about how the world works.  I'm not sure where all that energy went, but I know that some 
of it was transferred to a belief that Santa Claus doesn't exist.  
Now I have two contradictory distinctions about the nature of the world that exist in my mental 
system: one, Santa exists; two, Santa doesn't exist. The difference between them is in the amount of 
energy they contain. The first has virtually no energy; the second has energy. So from a functional 
perspective, there is no contradiction or conflict. I propose that, if it's possible to render one belief 
inactive, then it's possible to de-activate any belief, despite the fact that all beliefs seem  to resist any 
force that would alter their present form. The secret to effectively changing our beliefs is in 
understanding and, consequently, believing that we really aren't changing our beliefs; we are simp ly 
transferring energy from one concept to another concept, one that we find more useful in helping us 
to fulfill our desires or achieve our goals.  
2. All active beliefs demand expression. Beliefs fall into two basic categories: active and inactive. The 
distinction between the two is simple. Active beliefs are energized; they have enough energy to act 
as a force on our perception of information and on our behavior. An inactive belief is ju st the 
opposite. It is a belief, that for any number of reas ons, no longer has energy, or has so little energy 
that it's no longer able to act as a force on how we perceive information or how we express 
ourselves. When I say that all active beliefs dema nd expression, I don't mean to imply that every 
belief in our mental environment is demanding to express itself simultaneously. For example, if I 
ask you to think about what's wrong with the world today, the word "wrong" would bring to  your 
mind ideas about the nature of the world that reflect what you believe to be trou bling or disturbing. 
Unless, of course, there is nothing about the state of the world you find troubling. The point is, if 
there is something you do believe is wrong, you weren't necessarily thinking about those ideas 
before I asked the question; but the moment I did, your beliefs about these issues i nstantly moved to 
the forefront of your conscious thinking process. In effect, they demanded to be heard. I say  that 
beliefs "demand" to be expressed because once something causes us to tap into our beliefs, it seem s 
as if we can't stop the flood of energy that's releas ed. This is especially tr ue of emotionally sensitive 
issues or beliefs we feel particularly passionate about. You might ask, "Why would I want to hold 
back expressing my beliefs?" There could be several reasons. Consider a scenario in which you're 
this person is saying something that you completely disagree with, or even find utt erly absurd. Will 
you express your truth or hold back? That will depend on the beliefs you have abo ut what is proper 
in such a situation. If your beliefs dictate that speaking up would be inappropriate, and those beliefs 
have more energy than the ones that are being contradicted, then you'll probably hold bac k and not 
argue openly.  
You might be looking at this person (the boss) and nodding your head in agreement. But is your 
mind in agreement? More to the point, is your mi nd silent? Absolutely not! Your position on the 
issues being presented are effectively countering each point the boss is making. In other w ords, your 
beliefs are still demanding expression, but they aren't being expressed externally (in the 
environment) because other beliefs are acting as a counteracting; force. However O O ' they will 
soon find a way to get out, won't they? As soon as you are out of the situation, you will probably 
find a way to "unload," or even spew out your si de of the argument. You will probably describe 
what you had to endure to anyone you think will lend a sympathetic ear. Thi s is an example of how 
our beliefs demand to be expressed when they are in conflict with the external environment. But 
what happens when one or more of our beliefs are in conflict with our intents, go als, dreams, wants, 
or desires? The implications of such a conflict can have a profound effect on our trading. As we 
have already learned, beliefs create distinctions in how the external environment can ex press itself. 
Distinctions, by definition, are boundaries.  
Human consciousness, on the other hand, seems to be larger than the sum total of everything we 
have learned to believe. This "larger than" qualit y of human consciousness gives us the ability to 
think in any direction we choose, either inside or  outside of the boundaries imposed by our beliefs. 
Thinking outside of the boundaries of our beliefs is commonly referred to as creative thinking. 
When we purposely choose to question a belief (q uestion what we know), an d sincerely desire an 
answer, we make our minds available to receive a "brilliant idea," "inspiration," or "s olution" to the 
issue at hand. Creativity, bv definition, brings forth something- that didn't we will (b y definition, 
automatically) receive ideas or thoughts that are outside of anything that already exists in our 
rational mind as a belief or memory.  
As far as I know, there is no consensus among artists, inventors, or the religious or scientific 
communities as to exactly where creatively generated information comes from. However, what I do 
know is that creativity seems to be limitless and without boundaries. If there are any limits on the 
ways we can think, we certainly haven't found them yet. Consider the staggering pace at which 
technology has developed in the last 50 years alone. Every invention or development in the 
evolution of humanity was born in the minds of people who were willing to think outside the 
boundaries dictated by what they had learned to believ e. If all of us have th e inherent ability to think 
creatively (and I believe that we do), then we also have the potential to encounter what I cal l a 
"creative experience." I define a creative experience as the experience of anything new or outside 
the boundaries imposed by our beliefs. It could be a new sight—something we've never seen before, 
but from the environment's perspective was always there.  
Or we could experience a new sound, smell, taste, or touch. Creative experiences, like creative 
thoughts, inspirations, hunches, and brilliant ideas, can occur as a surprise or can be the result of our 
conscious direction. In either case, when we experience them we can be confronted with a major 
psychological dilemma. A creative occurrence, whether in the form of a thought or an experience, 
can cause us to be attracted to or desire something that is in direct conflict with one or  more of our 
beliefs. To illustrate the point, let's return to th e example of the boy and dog. Recall that the boy has 
had several painful experiences with dogs. The first experience was real from the environment's 
perspective. The others, however, were the result of how his mind processed information (based on 
the operation of the association and painavoidance mechanisms). The end result is that he 
experiences fear every time he encounters a dog. Let's suppose that the boy was a toddler when he 
had his first negatively charged experience.  
As he grows up and begins associating specific words and concepts with his mem ories, he will form 
a belief about the nature of dogs. It would be reasonable to assume that he adopted a belief 
something like, "All dogs are dangerous." With the use of the word "all," the boy's belief is 
structured in a way that assures that he will avoid a ll dogs. He has no reason to question this belief, 
because every experience has confirmed and reinforced its validity. However, he (and  everyone else 
on the planet) is susceptible to a creative experience. Under normal circumstances, the boy will do 
everything possible to make sure he does not encounter a dog. But what if something unexpected 
and unintended occurs? Suppose the boy is walking with his parents and, as a result, feels safe and 
protected. Now, suppose he and his parents come to a blind corner and cannot see what is on the 
other side. They encounter a scene in which several children of about the same age as the boy are 
playing with some dogs and, furthermore, they are obviously having a great deal of fun. This is a 
creative experience. The boy is confronted with indisputable information that what he believes ab out 
the nature of dogs isn't true. What happens now? Fi rst, the experience was not at the boy's conscious 
direction. He didn't make a decision to willingly expose himself to information that contradicted 
what he believed to be true. We might call this an inadvertent creative experience, because th e 
external environment forced him to confront other possibilities that he didn't believe existed. 
Second, the experience of seeing other children playing with dogs and not getting hurt will thr ow his 
mind into a state of confusion.  
After the confusion wears off, meaning as he begins to accept the possibility that not all dogs are 
dangerous, several scenarios are possible. Seeing other children his own age (with w hom he could 
strongly identify) having such a great time playing with dogs could cause the boy to decide that he 
wants to be like the other children and have fun with dogs, too. If that's the case, this inadvertent 
creative encounter has caused him to become attracted to express himself in a way that he formerly 
didn't believe was possible (interacting with dogs). In fact, the notion was so impossible that it 
wouldn't have even occurred to him to consider it. Now, he not only considers it, he desires it. Will 
he be able to express himself in a way that is consistent with his desire? The answer to this question 
is a matter of energy dynamics.  
There are two forces within the boy that are in direct conflict with each other, competing for 
expression: his belief that "all dogs are dangerous" and his desire to have fun and be like the other 
children. What he will do the next time he encounters a dog will be determined by whic h has more 
energy: his belief or his desire. Given the intensity of the energy in his belief that "Al l dogs are 
dangerous," we can reasonably assume that his belief will have far more energy than his des ire. If 
that's the case, then he will find his next encounter with a dog very frustrating. Even though  he may 
want to touch or pet the dog, he'll find that he can't interact with it in any way. The word "all" in his 
belief will act as a paralyzing force, prev enting him from fulfilling his desire.  
He might be well aware of the fact that the dog he wants to pet is not dangerous and  won't hurt him; 
but he won't be able to pet it un til the balance of energy tips in favor of his desire. If the boy 
genuinely wants to interact with dogs, he will have to overcome his fear. This means that he will 
have to de-activate his belief that all dogs are dangerous so he can properly install a belief  about 
dogs that is more consistent with his desire. We know that dogs can express themselves in a wide 
range of ways, from loving and gentle to mean and nasty. However, very few dogs on a percentage  
basis fall into the mean and nasty category. A good belief for the boy to adopt, then, would be 
something like, "Most dogs are friendly, but some can be mean and nasty."  
This belief would allow him to learn to recognize characteristics and behavior patte rns that will tell 
him which dogs he can play with and which ones to avoid. However, the larger issue is, how can th e 
boy de-activate the "all" in the belief that "All dogs are dangerous" so he can overcome his fear? 
Remember that all beliefs naturally resist any for ce that would alter their present form, but, as I 
indicated above, the appropriate approach is not to  try to alter the belief, but rather to draw the 
energy out of it and channel that energy into another belief that is better suited to our pur poses. To 
de-activate the concept the word "all" represents, th e boy will have to crea te a positively charged 
experience with a dog; at some point, he will have  to step through his fear and touch one. Doing this 
might require a great deal of effort on the boy's part over a considerable amount of time.  
Early in the process, his new realization about dogs might be strong enough only to allow him to be 
in the presence of a dog, at a distance, and not run away. However, each encounter with a dog, even 
at a distance, that doesn't result in a negative outcome will draw more and more of the negative  
energy out of his belief that "All dogs are danger ous." Eventually, each new positive experience will 
allow him to close the gap between himself and a dog, little by little, to the point that he can actually 
touch one. From an energy dynamics  perspective, he will be able to  touch a dog when his desire to 
do so is at least one degree greater in intensity than his belief that all dogs are dangerous.  
The moment he actually does touch a dog, it will have the effect of drawing most of th e remaining 
negative energy out of the "all" concept and transfer it to a belief that reflect s his new experience. 
Although it's probably not that common, there are people who, for various reasons, are motivated 
enough to purposely put themselves through the above described process. However, they may not be 
consciously aware of the dynamics involved. People who work through a childhood fear of this 
magnitude usually do so somewhat haphazardly over a period of years, without knowing for s ure 
exactly how they did it (unless they seek and get competent professional help). Later on, as adults, if 
they are asked or if they happen to encounter a situation that reminds them of their past (for 
instance, observing a child who is terrified of dogs), they typically characterize the process they 
went through as "I remember when I was afraid of dogs, but I grew out of it." The end result o f the 
first scenario was that the boy worked through his fear by de-activating his limiting belief about the 
nature of dogs. This allowed him to express himself in a way that he finds pleasing and that 
otherwise would have been impossible. The second scenario that could result from the  child's 
inadvertent creative experience with dogs is that he isn't attracted to the possibil ity of playing with a 
dog. In other words, he could not care less about being like the other children or interacting wi th 
dogs. In this case, his belief that all dogs are dangerous and his new realization that all dogs are not 
dangerous will exist in his mental environment as contradictory concepts.  
This is an example of what I call an active contradiction, when two active beliefs are in dire ct 
conflict with each other, both demanding expression. In this example, the first belief exists at a core  
level in the boy's mental environment, with a great deal of negatively charged energy. The se cond 
belief is at a more superficial level, and has very  little positively charged energy. The d ynamics of 
this situation are interesting, and extremely important. We have stated that beliefs control our 
perception of information. Under normal circumstances, the boy would have been perceptuall y 
blinded to the possibility of interacting with dogs, but the experience of seeing ot her children 
playing with them created a positively charged concept in his mental environment that dogs are not 
all dangerous; some can be friendly. However, he ha sn't done anything to de-activate the "all" in his 
belief that "All dogs are dangerous," and, as far as I know, beliefs have no capacity to de-activate 
themselves.  
As a result, beliefs exist in our mental environment from the moment they are bo rn to the moment 
we die, unless we consciously take steps to deacti vate them. However, in th is scenario, the boy has 
no desire and consequently no motivation to step through his fear. Therefore, the boy is left with an 
active contradiction where his minimally charged belief that not all dogs are dangerous gives him 
the ability to perceive the possibility  of playing with a dog, but his powerfully charged belief that all 
dogs are dangerous still causes him to experience some level of fear every time he encounters a dog 
(maybe not enough fear to cause him to run in terror , because some of that fe ar will be offset by the 
other belief, but there will certai nly be enough fear to cause a great deal of discomfort).  
The ability to "see" and consequently know that a situation is not dangerous, but at the same time 
find ourselves immobilized with fear, can be quite baffling if we don't understand that what we 
discover as the result of thinking creatively or realize from an inadvertent creative experience 
doesn't necessarily have enough energy to become a dominant force in our mental environment. In 
other words, our new awareness or discovery could very well have enough energy to act as a 
credible force on our perception of information, thereby causing us to perceive possibilities that 
would otherwise be invisible; but it might not have enough energy to act as a credible force on our 
behavior. In making this statement, I am operating out of the assumption that it takes more energy to 
act or express ourselves than the amount of energy it takes to observe something.  
On the other hand, new awareness and discoveries instantly and effortlessly become dominant 
forces if there's nothing inside us that's in conflic t with them. But if there are conflicting beliefs and 
we aren't willing to de-activate the conflicting forces (expending some effort), especially if they're 
negatively charged, then acting on what we've disc overed will be a struggle at the very least, and 
perhaps down right impossible. What I have just described is the psychological dilemma that 
virtually every trader has to resolve. Let's say you  have a firm grasp of the nature of probabilities 
and, as a result, you "know" that the next trade is si mply another trade in a series of trades that has a 
probable outcome. Yet you find you're still afraid to put that next trad e on, or you're still susceptible 
to several of the fear-based trading errors we've discussed in previous chapters. Remember that the 
underlying cause of fear is the po tential to define and interpret ma rket information as threatening. 
What is the source of our potential to interpret ma rket information as threatening? Our expectations! 
When the market generates information that doesn't conform to what we expect, the up and down 
tics seem to take on a threatening quality (become negatively charged). Consequently, we 
experience fear, stress, and anxiety. What is the un derlying source of our expectations? Our beliefs.  
In light of what you now understand about the nature of beliefs, if you are still experiencing 
negative states of mind when you trade, you can assume there's a conflict between wh at you "know" 
about probable outcomes and any number of other beliefs in your mental environment that are 
arguing (demanding expression) for something else. Keep in mind that all active beliefs demand  
expression, even if we don't want them to. To think in probabilities, you h ave to believe that every 
moment in the market is unique, or more specifically, that every edge has a unique outcom e. When 
you believe at a functional level that every edge has a unique outcome (meani ng that it's a dominant 
belief without any other beliefs arguing for something different), you will experience a state of mind 
that is free of fear, stress, and anxiety when you trade. It really can't work any o ther way. A unique 
outcome is not something we have already experienced, therefore it is not something  we can already 
know. If it were known, it could not be defined as unique.  
When you believe that you don't know what is going to happen next, what exact ly are you expecting 
from the market? If you said "I don't know," you are absolutely right. If you believe that some thing 
will happen and that you don't need to know exactly what that something is to make  money, then 
where s the potential to define an d interpret market information as  threatening and painful? If you 
said "There is none," you are absolutely right again. Here is one more example of how beliefs 
demand expression. Let's look at a situation where a child's first encounter with a dog was a very 
positive experience. As a result, he has absolutely no problem interacting with dogs (any d og for 
that matter), because he has not encountered one that's unfriendly. Therefore, he has no conc ept (an 
energized belief) that it is possible for a dog to inflict any damage or cause him to experience pain . 
As he learns to associate words with his memories, he will probably acquire a belief along the lines 
of "all dogs are friendly and fun." Therefore, every time a dog comes into his field of awaren ess, this 
belief will demand expression. From the perspective of someone who fi with a do?, it will seem as if 
this child has an attitude of reckless abandon.  
If you tried to convince the child that he'll get bitten someday if he doesn't exercise ca ution, his 
belief will cause him to either discount or completely disregard your advice. His response woul d be 
something like "No way!" or "It can't happen to me." Let's say at some point in his life he 
approaches an unfamiliar dog that wants to be  left alone. The dog growls. The warning will go 
unheeded and the dog attacks the boy. From the perspe ctive of the boy's belief system, he's just had 
a creative experience. What effect will this experience have on his belief that "all dogs are friendly"? 
Will he now be afraid of all dogs as the child in the first example was?  
Unfortunately, the answers to these questions are not cut and dried, because there may be other 
beliefs, also demanding expression, that don't have anything specifically to do with dogs that come 
into play in a situation like this. For example, wh at if this child has a highly developed belief in 
betrayal (he believes he's been betrayed by some very significant people in some very significant 
situations that have caused him to experience intense emotional pain). If he associa tes the attack by 
this one dog as a "betrayal" by dogs in general (in essence a betrayal of his belief in dogs), then he 
could easily find himself afraid of all dogs.  
All of the positive energy contained in his original belief could instantly be transformed into 
negatively charged energy. The boy could justify this  shift with a rationalization like "If one dog can 
betray me, then any dog can." However, I do think this is an extreme and very unlikely occurrence. 
What is more likely is the word "all" in his original belief will instantly be de-activated and that 
energy will get transferred to a new belief that better reflects the true nature of dogs. Th is new 
experience caused an energy shift that forced him to learn something about the nature of dogs that 
he otherwise refused to consider possible.  
His belief in the friendliness of dogs remains inta ct. He will still play with dogs, but he will now 
exercise some discretion by consciously looking for signs of friendliness or unfriendliness. I think 
that a fundamental truth about the nature of our existence is every moment in the market, as well as 
in evervdav life, has elements of what we know (similarities) and elements that we don't or can't 
know because we haven't experienced it yet. Until we actively train our minds to expect a unique 
outcome, we will continue experiencing only what we know; everything else (o ther information and 
possibilities that are not consistent with what we  know and expect) will pass us by, unperceived, 
discounted, distorted, outright denied, or attacked. When you truly believe that you don't need to 
know, you will be thinking in probabilities (the market perspective) and will have no reason to 
block, discount, distort, deny, or attack anything the market is offering about its pote ntial to move in 
any particular direction. If you are not experiencing the quality of menta l freedom implied in that 
statement, and it is your desire to do so, then you must take an active role in training  your mind to 
believe in the uniqueness of each moment, and you must de-activate any other belief that argues for 
something different. This process isn't any different from the one the boy in the first scenario went 
through, nor is it going to happen by itself. He want ed to interact with dogs without fear, but to do 
so he had to create a new belief and de-activate the conflicting ones. This is the secret to achieving 
consistent success as a trader.  
 
3. Beliefs keep on working regardless of whether we are consciously aware of their existence in our 
mental environment. In other words, we don't have to actively remember or have conscious access 
to any particular belief for that belief to act as a force on our perception of information or on our 
behavior. I know it s hard to "believe" that something we can't even remember can  still have an 
impact on our lives. But when you think about it, much of what we learn throughout our lives is 
stored at an unconscious or subconscious level. If I asked you to remember each specific skill you 
had to learn so that you could drive a car with confidence, chances are you wouldn't  remember all 
the things you needed to concentrate and focus on while you were in the process of learnin g. The 
first time I had the opportunity to teach a teenager how to drive, I was absolutely amazed at how 
much there was to learn, how much of the process I took for granted and no longer thought about at 
a conscious level. Possibly the best example that ill ustrates this characteristic is people who drive 
under the influence of alcohol. On any given day or night, there are probably thousands of  people 
who have had so much to drink that they have no idea that they have no conscious awareness of how 
they drove from point A to point B. It is difficult to imagine how this is possible, unless you 
consider that driving skills and one's belief in his ability to drive operate automatically on a much 
deeper level than waking consciousness. Certainly, some percentage of these drunk dri vers get into 
accidents, but when you compare the accident rate with the estimated number of people driving 
under the influence of alcohol, it's remarkable that there aren't a great many more accidents. In fact, 
a drunk driver is probably most likely to cause an accident when he either falls asleep or some thing 
requires a conscious decision and a fast reaction. In other words, the driving conditions are such that 
operating out of one's subconscious skills is not enough. 
 
SELF EVALUATION AND TRADING 
 
How this characteristic applies to ou r trading is also quite profound. The trading environment offers us 
an arena of unlimited opportunities to accumulate wealth. But just because the money is available and 
we can perceive the possibility of getting it, that doesn't necessarily mean that we (as individuals) have 
an unlimited sense of selfvaluation. In other words, there could be a huge gap between ho w much 
money we desire for ourselves, how much we perceive  is available, and how much we actually believe 
we are worth or deserve. Everyone has a sense of self-valuation. The easiest w ay to describe this sense 
is to list every active belief, both conscious and subconscious, that has the potential to argue either for 
or against accumulating or achieving greater and greater levels of success and prosperity. Then match 
the energy from the positively charged beliefs against the energy from th e negatively charged beliefs. If 
you have more positively charged energy arguing for success and prosperity than negative ly charged 
energy arguing against them, then you have a positive sense of self-valuation. Otherwise, you have a 
negative sense of self-valuation. The dynamics of how these beliefs interact with one anothe r is not 
nearly so simple as I'm making it sound. In fact, it can be so complex that it could take year s of 
sophisticated mental work to organize and sort out. What you need to know is that it's alm ost 
impossible to grow up in any social environment and not acquire some negatively char ged beliefs that 
would argue against success or accumulating vast sums of money.  
Most of these self-sabotaging beliefs have long been forgotten and operate at a s ubconscious level, but 
the fact that we may have forgotten them doesn't mean they've been de-activated. How do we acquire 
self-sabotaging beliefs? Unfortunately, it's extremely easy. Probably the most common way is when a 
child engages in some activity that a parent or teacher doesn't want him to do and the  child accidently 
injures himself. Many parents, to get their point across  to the child, will respond to a situation like this 
by saying, "This (whatever pain you are experiencing) wouldn't have happened to you if you didn 't 
deserve it," or "You disobeyed me and look what happened, God punished you."  The problem with 
making or hearing statements like this is that there's a potential for the child to associate every future 
injury with these same statements and, subsequently, form a belief that he must be an u nworthy person, 
undeserving of success, happiness, or love. Anything we feel guilty about can have  an adverse effect on 
our sense of self-worth.  
Usually guilt is associated with being a bad person, and most people believe that bad people should be 
punished, certainly not rewarded. Some religions teach children that having a lot of money  isn't godly 
or spiritual. Some people believe that making money in certain ways is wrong, even  though it may be 
perfectly legal and moral from society's perspective. Again, you may not have a speo ifir recollection of 
learning something that would argue against the success you perceive as possible, but  that doesn't mean 
that what you learned is no longer having an eff ect. The way these subconscious self-sabotaging beliefs 
manifest themselves in our trading is usually in the form of lapses in focus or concentration,  resulting 
in any number of trading errors, like putting in a buy for a sell or vice versa, or allowin g yourself to 
give in to distracting thoughts that compel you to leave the screen, only to find out when you return that 
you missed the big trade of the day.  
I've worked with many traders who achieved various levels of consistent success, but found they just 
couldn't break through certain thresholds in acquiring equity. They discovere d an invisible but very real 
barrier similar to the proverbial glass ceiling that many women executives experience in the corporate 
world. Every time these traders hit the barrier, they experienced a significant draw down, regardless of 
the market conditions. However, when asked about wh at happened, they typica lly blamed their sudden 
run of bad luck on just that—luck or the vagaries of the market. Interestingly, they typic ally created a 
steadily rising equity curve, sometimes over a period of several months, and the significant draw down 
always occurred at the same spot in their equity curve.  
I describe this psychological phenomenon as being in a "negative zone." As magically as m oney can 
flow into a trader's accounts when he is "in the zone," it can just as easily flow out, if he is in a nega tive 
zone where unresolved self-valuation issues mysteriously act on his perceptio n of information and 
behavior. I am not implying here that you have to de-activate every belief that would argue  against 
your ever-expanding positive sense of selfvaluation, because you don't. But you must be aware of the 
presence of such beliefs, and take specific steps in your trad ing regimen to compensate when they start 
expressing themselves. CHAPTER  
 
CHAPTER 11  
 
THINKING LIKE A TRADER 
 
If you asked me to distill trading down to its simple st form, I would say that it is a pattern recognition 
numbers game. We use market analysis to identify th e patterns, define the risk, and determine when to 
take profits. The trade either works or it doesn't. In any case, we go on to die next trade. It's that simple, 
but it's certainly not easy. In fact, trading is probably the hardest thing you' ll ever attempt to be 
successful at. That's not because it requires intellect; quite the contrary! But because the more you think 
you know, the less successful you'll be.  
Trading is hard because you have to operate in a state of not having to know, even though your analysis 
may turn out at times to be "perfectly" correct. To operate in a state of not having to know, you have to 
properly manage your expectations. To properly manage your expect ations, you must realign your 
mental environment so that you believe without a shadow of a doubt in the five fundamental truths. In 
this chapter, I am going to give you a trading exercise  that will integrate these truths about the market 
at a functional level in your mental environment. In the process, I'll take you through the three stages of 
development of a trader.  
The first stage is the mechanical stage. In this stage, you:  
 
1. Build the self-trust necessary to operate in an unlimited environment.  
2. Learn to flawlessly execute a trading system.  
3. Train your mind to think in probabilit ies (the five fundamental truths).  
4. Create a strong, unshakeable belief in your consistency as a trader.  
 
Once you have completed this first stage, you can then advance to the subjective stage of trading. In 
this stage, you use anything you have ever learne d about the nature of ma rket movement to do 
whatever it is you want to do. There's a lot of free dom in this stage, so you will have to learn how to 
monitor your susceptibility to make the kind of trading errors that are the result of any unresolved self-
valuation issues I referred to in the last chapter. The third stage is the intuitive stage. Trading intuitively 
is the most advanced stage of development. It is the trading equivalent of earning a black be lt in the 
martial arts.  
The difference is that you can't try to be intuitive , because intuition is spontaneous. It doesn't come 
from what we know at a rational level. The rational part of our mind seems to be inherently mi strustful 
of information received from a source that it doesn't understand. Sensing that something is about to 
happen is a form of knowing that is very different from anything we know rationally. I've worked with 
many traders who frequently had a very strong intu itive sense of what was going to happen next, only 
to be confronted with the rational part of themselves that consistently, argued for another course of 
action. Of course, if they had followed their intu ition, they would have experienced a very satisfying 
outcome. Instead, what they ended up with was usually very unsatisfactory, especially when compared 
with what they otherwise perceived as possible. The only way I know of that you can try to be intuitive 
is to work at setting up a state of mind most conducive to receiving and acting on your intuitive 
impulses.  
 
THE MECHANICAL STAGE 
 
The mechanical stage of trading is specifically de signed to build the kind of trading skills (trust, 
confidence, and thinking in probabilities) that will virtually compel you to create consistent results. I 
define consistent results as a steadily rising equity curve with only minor draw downs that are the 
natural consequence of edges that didn't work. Other than finding a pattern that  puts the odds of a 
winning trade in your favor, achieving a steadily rising equity curve is a function of systematically 
eliminating any susceptibility you may have to making the kind of fear, euphoric or self-valuation  
based trading errors I have described throughout this book. Eliminating the errors and expanding your 
sense of self-valuation will require the acquisition of skills that are all psychological in nature.  
The skills are psychological because each one, in its purest form, is simply a belief. Remember that the 
beliefs we operate out of will determine our state of mind and shape our experiences in ways that 
constantly reinforce what we already believe to be true. How truthful a belief is (relati ve to the 
environmental conditions) can be determined by how well it serves us; that is, the  degree to which it 
helps us satisfy our objectives.  
If producing consistent results is your primary objective as a trader, then creating a belief (a conscious, 
energized concept that resists change and demands expression) that "I am a consistently successful 
trader" will act as a primaiy source of energy that w ill manage your perceptions, interpretations, 
expectations, and actions in ways that satisfy the belief and, consequently, the objective. Creating a 
dominant belief that "I am a consistently successful trader" requires adherence to several principles of 
consistent success. Some of these principles will undoubtedly be in direct conflict with some of the 
beliefs you've already acquired about trading. If this is the case, then what you have is a classic  
example of beliefs that are in direct conflict with desire. 
The energy dynamic here is no different from what it was for the boy who wanted to be like the  other 
children who were not afraid to play with dogs. He desired to express himself in a way  that he found, at 
least initially, virtually impossible. To satisfy his desire, he had to step into an active process of 
transformation. His technique was simple: He tried as hard as he could to stay focused on w hat he was 
trying to accomplish and, little by little, he de-a ctivated the conflicting belief and strengthened the 
belief that was consistent with his desire.  
At some point, if that is your desire, then you will have to step into the process of transforming yourself 
into a consistent winner. When it comes to personal transformation, the m ost important ingredients are 
your willingness to change, the clarity of your intent , and the strength of your desire. Ultimately, for 
this process to work, you must choose consistency over eveiy other reason or justification you have  for 
trading. If all of these ingredients are sufficiently present, then regardless of the internal obstacles you 
find yourself up against, what you  desire will eventually prevail.  
 
Observe Yourself 
 
The first step in the process of creating consistency is to start noticing what  you're thinking, saying, and 
doing. Why? Because everything we think, say, or do as a trader contributes to and, therefore, 
reinforces some belief in our mental system. Because the process of becoming consistent is 
psychological in nature, it shouldn't come as a surprise that you'll have t o start paying attention to your 
various psychological processes. The idea is eventually to learn to become an objective ob server of 
your own thoughts, words, an d deeds. Your first line of defense ag ainst committing a trading error is to 
catch yourself thinking about it. Of course, the last line of defense is to catch yourself in the act. If you 
don't commit yourself to becoming an observer to th ese processes, your realizations will always come 
after the experience, usually when you are in a state of deep regret and frustration.  
Observing yourself objectively implies doing it without  judging about yourself. This might not be so 
easy for some of you to do considering the harsh, judgmental treatment you may ha ve received from 
other people throughout your life. As a result, one quickly learns to associate any mistake with 
emotional pain. No one likes to be in a state of emotional pain, so we typically avoid acknowledging 
what we have learned to define as a mistake for as long as possible.  
Not confronting mistakes in our everyday lives usually doesn't have th e same disastrous consequences 
it can have if we avoid confronting our mistakes as traders. For example, when I am working with f loor 
traders, the analogy I use to illustrate how precarious  a situation they are in is to ask them to imagine 
themselves walking across a bridge over the Grand Canyon. The width of the bridge is directly related 
to the number of contracts they trade. So, for example, for a one-contract trader the bridge is very wide, 
say 20 feet. A bridge 20 feet wide allows you a great deal of tolerance for error, so you don't h ave to be 
inordinately careful or focused on each step you take. Still, if you do happen to stum ble and trip over 
the edge, the drop to the canyon floor is one mile.  
I don't know how many people would walk across a narrow bridge with no guardrails, where the 
ground is a mile down, but my guess is relatively few. Similarly, few pe ople will take the kinds of risks 
associated with trading on the floor of the futures exchanges. Certainly a one-contract floor trader can 
do a great deal of damage to himself, not unlike falling off a mile-high bridge. But a one-contract t rader 
also can give himself a wide tolerance for errors, miscalculations, or unusually violent m arket moves 
where he could find himself on the wrong side. On the other hand, one of the biggest  floor traders I 
ever worked with trades for his own account with an average position of 500 Treasury bond f utures at a 
time. He often puts on a position of well over a thousand contracts.  
A position of 1,000 T-bond contracts amounts to $31,500 per tic (the smallest incremental price change 
that a bond contract can make). Of course, T-bond futures can be very volatile and can trade several 
tics in either direction in a matter of seconds. As the size of a traders position increases, the width of 
our bridge over the Grand Canyon narrows. In the case of the large bond trader, the bridge has 
narrowed to the size of a thin wire. Obviously, he has to be extremely well-balanced and very fo cused 
on each step that he takes. The slightest misstep or gust of wind could cause him to fa ll off the wire. 
Next stop, one mile down. Now, when he's in the trading pit, that tiny m isstep or slight gust of wind is 
the equivalent to one distracting thought. That's all, just a thought or anything else where he allows 
himself to lose his focus for even a second or two. In that moment of distractio n, he could miss his last 
favorable opportunity to liquidate his position.  
The next price level with enough volume to take him out of his trade could be several tics away, either 
creating a huge loss or forcing him to give a substantial winning trade back to the market. If producin g 
consistent results is a function of eliminating errors , then it is an understatement to say that you will 
encounter great difficulty in achieving your objective if you can't acknowledge a mistake. Obviou sly, 
this is something very few people can do, and it accounts for why there are so few consistent winners. 
In fact, the tendency not to acknowledge a mistake is so pervasive throughout mankind, it could lead 
one to assume that it's an inherent characteristic of  human nature. I do not believe this is the case, nor 
do I believe we are born with the capacity to ridicule or think less of ourselves for m aking a mistake, 
miscalculation, or error. Making mist akes is a natural function of living and will continue to be until we 
reach a point at which:  
 
1. all our beliefs are in absolute harmony with our desires, and  
2. all our beliefs are structured in such a way that they are completely consistent with what works fr om 
the environment's perspective.  
Obviously, if our beliefs are not consistent with what works from the environme nts perspective, the 
potential for making a mistake is high, if not inevit able. We won't be able to perceive the appropriate 
set of steps to our objective. Worse, we won't be able to perceive that what we want may not be 
available, or available in the quantity we desire or at the time when we want it.  
On the other hand, mistakes that are the result of be liefs that are in conflict with our objectives aren't 
always apparent or obvious. We know  they will act as opposi ng forces, expressing their versions of the 
truth on our consciousness, and they can do that in many ways.  
The most difficult to detect is a distracting thought that causes a momentary lapse in focus or 
concentration. On the surface this may not sound significant. But, as in the anal ogy of the bridge over 
the canyon, when there's a lot at stake, even a slightly diminished capacity to stay focused can result in 
an error of disastrous proportions. This principle applies whether it's trading, sporting events, o r 
computer programming. When our intent is clear and undiminished by any opposing energy, then our 
capacity to stay focused is greater, and the more li kely it is that we will accomplish our objective.  
Earlier I defined a winning attitude as a positive expectation of our efforts, with an acceptan ce that 
whatever results we do get are a perfect reflection of our level of development and what we need to 
learn to do better. What separates the "consistently gr eat" athletes and performers from everyone else is 
their distinct lack of fear of making a mistake. The reason they aren't afraid is that they don't h ave a 
reason to think less of themselves when they do make a mistake, meaning they don't  have a reservoir of 
negatively charged energy waiting to well up and pounce on their conscious thought process like a lion 
waiting for the right moment to pounce on its intended prey. What accounts for t his uncommon 
capacity to quickly move beyond their errors without criticizing themselves?  
One explanation may be that they grew up with extremely unusual parents, teachers, and c oaches, who 
by their words and examples taught them to correct their miscalculations and errors with genuine love, 
affection, and acceptance. I say "extremely unusual" because many of us grew up with j ust the opposite 
experience. We were taught to correct our mistakes or miscalculations with anger, impatience, and a 
distinct lack of acceptance. Is it possible that, for the great athletes, their past positive experiences with 
respect to mistakes caused them to acquire a belief that mistakes simply point the way to where they 
need to focus their efforts to grow and improve themselves? With a belief like that, there's no so urce of 
negatively charged energy and consequently no source for self-denigrating thoughts.  
However, the rest of us, who did grow up experien cing a plethora of negative reactions to our actions, 
would naturally acquire beliefs about mistakes: "Mistakes must be avoided at all costs," "T here must be 
something wrong with me if I make a mistake," "I must be a screw-up," or "I must be a bad p erson if I 
make a mistake." Remember that every thought, word, and deed reinforces some belief we have about 
ourselves. If, by repeated negative self-criticism, we acquire a belief that we're "screw-ups," that belief 
will find a way to express itself in our thoughts, causing us to become distracted and to screw up; on 
our words, causing us to say things about ourselves or about others (if we notice the same 
characteristics in them) that reflect our belief; and on our actions, causing us to behave in ways  that are 
overtly self-sabotaging. If you're going to become a consistent winner, mistakes can 't exist in the kind 
of negatively charged context in which they are held by most people.  
You have to be able to monitor yourself to some degree, and that will be diff icult to do if you have the 
potential to experience emotional pain if and when you find yourself in the process of making an error. 
If this potential exists, you have two choices:  
 
1. You can work on acquiring a new set of positively charged beliefs about what it means to make a 
mistake, along with de-activating any negatively charged beliefs that would argue o therwise or cause 
you to think less of yourself for making a mistake.  
2. If you find this first choice undesirable, you can compensate for the potential to make errors by the 
way you set up your trading regime.  
 
This means that if you're going to trade and not monitor yourself, but at the same time you desire 
consistent results, then trading exclusively from the mechanical stage will resolve the dilemma.  
Otherwise, learning how to monitor yourself is a relatively simple process once you have rid yourself 
of negatively charged energy associated with mistakes. In fact, it's easy. All you h ave to do is decide 
why you want to monitor yourself, which means you first need to have a clear purpose in mi nd. When 
you're clear about your purpose, simp ly start directing your attention to what you think, say, or do.  
If and when you notice that you're not focused on your objective or on the incremental steps t o 
accomplish your objective, choose to redirect your thoughts, words, or actions in a  way that is 
consistent with what you are trying to accomplish. Keep redirecting as often as necessary.  The more 
willfully you engage in this process, especially if you can do it with some degree of c onviction, the 
faster you will create a mental framework free to function in a way that is consistent with your 
objectives, without any resistance from conflicting beliefs.  
 
THE ROLE OF SELF-DISCIPLINE 
 
I call the process I just described self-discipline. I define self-discipline as a mental technique to 
redirect (as best we can) our focus of attention to the object of our goal or desir e, when that goal or 
desire conflicts with some other component (belief) of our mental environment. The first thing you 
should notice about this definition is that self -discipline is a technique to create a new mental 
framework. It is not a personality trait; people aren 't born with self-discipline. In fact, when you 
consider how I define it, being born with discipline isn't even possible. However, as a  technique to be 
used in the process of personal transformation, anybody can choose to use self-discipl ine. Here is an 
example from my life that illustrates the underlying dynamics of how this technique works. In 1978 I 
decided that I wanted to become a runner.  
I don't exactly remember what my underlying motivation was, except that I had spent the previous 
eight years in a very inactive life style. I wasn't  involved with any sports or hobbies, unless you call 
watching television a hobby. Previously in both high  school and at least part of college I was very 
active in sports, especially ice hockey. However, coming out of college, my life was unfolding in the 
way that was very different from what I had expected. It was not to my liking, but at the time I felt 
powerless to do anything about it. This led to a peri od of inactivity, which is a nice way of saying that I 
was severely depressed. Again, I'm not sure what prompted me to suddenly want to be come a runner 
(maybe I saw some TV program that sparked my interest).  
I do, however, remember that the motivation was verv strong. So, I went out and bought myself some 
running shoes, put them on, and went out to run. The first thing I discovered was that I could n't do it. I 
didn't have the physical stamina to run more than fifty or sixty yards. This was very surprising . I didn't 
realize, nor would I have ever believed, that I was so out of shape that I couldn't run even a hundred 
yards. This realization was so disheartening that I didn't attempt to run agai n for two or three weeks. 
The next time out, I still couldn't run more than fifty or sixty yards. I tried again t he next day with, of 
course, the same result. 
I became so discouraged about my deteriorated phy sical condition that I didn't run again for another 
four months. Now, it's the spring of 1979. I'm once again determined to become a runner, but, at the 
same time, very frustrated with my lack of progress. As I was contemplating my dilemma, it oc curred 
to me that one of my problems was that I didn't have a goal to work towards. Saying that I wanted to be 
a runner was great, but what did that mean? I really didn't know; it was too vague and abstract. I had to 
have something more tangible to work towards.  
So I decided that I wanted to be able to run five miles by the end of the summer. Five miles seemed 
insurmountable at the time, but thinki ng that I might be able to do it generated a lot of enthusiasm. This 
increased level of enthusiasm gave me enough impetus to run four times that week. At the end of this 
first week, I was really surprised to discover even a little bit of exercise improved my stamina and 
ability to run a little farther each time. This created even more enthusiasm, so I went out and bought a 
stop watch and blank book to be used as a running diary. I set up a two-mile course, and ma rked off 
each quarter mile. In the diary I entered the date, my distance, my time, and how I felt physically each 
time I ran. Now I thought I was well on my way to the five miles, until I literally ran into my next set of 
problems.  
The biggest were the conflicting and distracting thoughts that flooded my consciousness eve ry time I 
decided I wanted to go out and run. I was amazed at the number (and intensity) of the reasons I found 
for not doing it: "It's hot [or] cold ou tside," "It looks like it's going to rain," "I'm still a little tired from 
the last time I ran (even though it was three days ago)," "Nobody else I know is doing this," or the most 
prevalent, "I'll go as soon as this TV program is over" (of course I never went). I didn't k now any other 
way to deal with this conflicting mental energy except to redirect my conscious attenti on on what I was 
trying to accomplish. I really wanted to get to five miles by the end of the summer. I f ound that 
sometimes my desire was stronger than the conflict. As a result, I managed to get my running shoes on,  
actually step outside, and start running. However, more times than not, my conflicting an d distracting 
thoughts caused me to stay put. In fact, in the beginn ing stages, I estimate that two-thirds of the time I 
was unable to get past the conflicting energy.  
The next problem I encountered was that when I started approaching the point where I was able to run 
one mile, I was so thrilled with myself that it oc curred to me I was going to need an additional 
mechanism to get me to the five miles. I reasoned that once I got to the point where I could run two or 
maybe three miles, I would be so overwhelmingly pleased with myself that I wouldn't feel any need to 
fulfill my five-mile objective. So I made a rule fo r myself. You could call it the five-mile rule. "If I 
managed to get my running shoes on and get outside in spite of all the conflicting thoughts trying to 
talk me out of it, I committed myself  to running at least one step farthe r than the last time I ran." It was 
certainly all right if I ran more than one step further, but it couldn't be less than one step , no matter 
what. As it turns out, I never broke this rule, and by the end of the summer, I made it to fiv e miles.  
But then, something really interesting and completely unanticipated happened bef ore I got there. As I 
got closer to fulfilling my five-mile objective, little by  little, the conflicting thoughts began to dissipate. 
Eventually they didn't exist at all. At that point, I found that if I wanted to run, I was completely fr ee to 
do so without any mental resistance, conflict, or competing thoughts. Given what a struggle  it had been, 
I was amazed (to say the least). The result: I went on  to run on a very regular basis for the next 16 
years. For those of you who may be interested, I don't run so much now beca use five years ago I 
decided to start playing ice hockey again.  
Hockey is an extremely strenuous sport. Sometimes I play as many as four times a week. Conside ring 
my age (over u\j) and the level of exertion the sport requires, it usually takes me a day or two to 
recover, which doesn't leave much room for running any more. Now, if you take these experiences and 
put them into the context of what we now understand about the nature of beliefs, ther e are a number of 
observations we can make:  
 
1. Initially, my desire to be a runner had no foundatio n of support in my mental system. In other words, 
there was no other source of energy (an energized concept demanding expression ) consistent with my 
desire.  
2. I actually had to do something to create that support. To create a belief that "I am a ru nner" required 
that I create a series of experiences consistent with the new belief. Remember that  everything we think, 
say, or do contributes energy to some belief in our mental system. Each time I experienced a 
conflicting thought and was able to successfully refocu s on my objective, with enough conviction to get 
me into my running shoes and out the door, I added energy to the belief that "I am a runner." And, just 
as important, I inadvertently drew energy away from all of the beliefs that would argue otherwise. I say 
inadvertently because there are various techniques specifically designed to identify and de-activat e 
conflicting beliefs, but at that time in my life, I didn't understand the underlying dynamics of the 
process of transformation I was going through. So, it wouldn't have occurred to me to avail myself of 
such techniques.  
3. Now I can effortlessly (from a mental perspective) express myself as a runner, because "I am a 
runner." That energized concept is now a functioning part of my identity. When I first started out, I 
happened to have a number of conflicting beliefs about running. As a result, I needed the technique of 
self-discipline to bfCCITic One. Now I don't need self-discipline because "bHn" a. rj^iicr"  'c "who I L -
~o am." When our bfeliers are completely aligned with our goals or desires, there's no source of 
conflicting energy. If there's no source of conflicting energy, then there's no source  of distracting 
thoughts, excuses, rationalizations, justifications , or mistakes (conscious or subconscious).  
4. Beliefs can be changed, and if it's possible to change one belief, then it's poss ible to change any 
belief, if you understand that you really aren't changing them, but are only transferrin g energy from one 
concept to another. (The form of the belief targeted for change remains intact.) Therefore, two 
completely contradictory beliefs can exist in your mental system, side by side. B ut if you've drawn the 
energy out of one belief and completely energized the other, no contradiction exists from a fun ctional 
perspective; only the belief that the energy will have the capacity to act as a force on your state of 
mind, on your perception and interpretation of information, and your behavior. Now, the sol e purpose 
of trading mechanically is to transf orm yourself into a consistently successful trader. If there's anything 
in your mental environment that's in conflict with the principles of creating the belief that "I am a 
consistently successful trader," then you will need to employ the technique of self-discipline to 
integrate these principles as a dominant, functioning part of your identity. Once the prin ciples become 
"who you are," you will no longer need self-discipline, because the process of "being consistent" will 
become effortless. Remember that consistency is not the same as the ability to  put on a winning trade, 
or even a string of winning trades for that matter, because putting on a winning trade requires 
absolutely no skill. All you have to do is guess correctly, which is no different than guessing the 
outcome of a coin toss, whereas consistency is a state of mind that, once achieved, won't allow you to 
"be" any other way. You won't have to try to be consistent because it will be a natural functio n of your 
identity. In fact, if you have to try, it's an indication that you haven't completely integrated the 
principles of consistent success as dominant, unconflic ted beliefs. For example, predefining your risk is 
a step in the process of "being consistent." If it takes any special effort to predefine your risk, if you 
have to consciously remind yourself to do it, if you experience any conflicting th oughts (in essence, 
trying to talk you out of doing it), or if you find yourself in a trade where you haven't pred efined your 
risk, then this principle is not a dominant, functioning part of your identity. It is n't "who you are." If it 
were, it wouldn't even occur to you not to predefine your risk. If and when all of the sources of conflic t 
have been de-activated, there's no longer a potential for you to "be" any other way. Wha t was once a 
struggle will become virtually effortless. At that point, it may seem to other people that you are so 
disciplined (because you can do something they find di fficult, if not impossible), but the reality is that 
you aren't being disciplined at all; you are simply func tioning from a different set of beliefs that compel 
you to behave in a way that is consistent with your desires, goals, or objectives.  
 
CREATING A BELIEF IN CONSISTENCY 
 
Creating a belief that "I am a consistent winner" is the primary objective, but like my intention to 
become a runner, it's too broad and abstract to implement without breaking it down in to a step-by-step 
process. So what I'm going to do is break this belief down into its smallest definable parts and then give 
you a plan to integrate each part as a dominant belief. The following sub-beliefs are the building 
Thinking Like a Trader 185 blocks that provide the underlying structure for what it means "to be a 
consistent winner."  
 
 
 
I AM A CONSISTENT WINNER BECAUSE:  
 
1. I objectively identify my edges.  
2. I predefine the risk of every trade.  
3. I completely accept risk or I am willing to let go of the trade.  
4. I act on my edges without reservation or hesitation.  
5. I pay myself as the market makes money available to me.  
6. I continually monitor my susc eptibility for making errors.  
7. I understand the absolute necessity of these prin ciples of consistent su ccess and, therefore, I 
never violate them.  
 
These beliefs are the seven principles of consistency. To integrate these principles into you r mental 
system at a functional level requires that you purposely  create a series of experiences that are consistent 
with them. This is no different from the boy who wanted to play with dogs or my desire to be a runner. 
Before he could play with a dog, the boy first had to make several attempts just to get close to one. 
Eventually, as the balance of energy in his mental system shifted, he could play with dogs without any 
internal resistance. To become a runner, I had to create the experience of running in spite of everything 
inside me that argued otherwise. Eventually, as the energy shifted more and more in favor of thi s new 
definition of myself, running became a natural expression of my identity.  
Obviously, what we're trying to accomplish here is far more complex than becoming a runner or petting 
a dog, but the underlying dynamics of the process are identical. We'll start with a specific objective. 
The first principle of consistency is the belief, "I ob jectively identify my edges." The key word here is 
objectively. Being objective means there's no potential to define, interpret, and therefore perceive any  
market information from either a painful or euphoric perspective.  
The way to be objective is to operate out of beliefs that keep your expectations neutral and to alway s 
take the unknown forces into consideration. Remember, you have to specifically train your mind to be 
objective and to stay focused in the "now moment opportunity flow."  Our minds are not naturally wired 
to think this way, so to be an objective observer you have to learn to think from the market's 
perspective. From the market's perspective, there ar e always unknown forces (traders) waiting to act on 
price movement. Therefore, from the market's perspective, "every moment is truly unique," eve n 
though the moment may look, sound, or feel exactly the same as some moment logged away in your 
memory bank.  
The instant you either decide or assume you know what's going to happen next, yo u will automatically 
expect to be right. However, what you know, at least at the rational level of thinking, can o nly take into 
consideration your unique past, which may not have any relationship to what is actually  happening 
from the markets perspective. At that point, any ma rket information that is not consistent with your 
expectation has the potential to be defined and interpreted as painful. To avoid expe riencing the pain, 
your mind will automatically compensate, with both conscious and subconscious pain-avoidance 
mechanisms, for any differences between what you expect and what the market is offeri ng. What you 
will experience is commonly referred to as an "illusion." In a state of illusion, you are neither objective 
nor connected to the "now moment opportunity flow."  
Instead, you become susceptible to committing all the typical trading errors (hesitating, jumping the 
gun, not predefining your risk, defining your risk but refusing to take the loss and lett ing the trade turn 
into a bigger loser, getting out of a winning trade too soon, not taking any profits out of a winning 
trade, letting a winning trade turn into a loser, moving  a stop closer to your entry point, getting stopped 
out and watching the market trade back in your favor, or trading too large a posi tion in relationship to 
your equity). The five fundamental truths about the market will keep your expectations neutral, focus 
your mind in the "now moment opportunity flow" (by disassociating die present moment from you r 
past), and, therefore, eliminate your potential to commit these errors. When you stop ma king trading 
errors, you'll begin trusting yourself. As your sense of self-trust increases, so will your sense of 
selfconfidence. The greater your confidence, the easier it will be to execute your trad es (act on your 
edges without reservation or hesitation).  
The five truths will also create a state of mind in  which you will genuinely accept the risks of trading. 
When you genuinely accept the risks, you will be at peace with any outcome. When yo u're at peace 
with any outcome, you will experience a carefree, objective state of mind, where you make yourself 
available to perceive and act upon whatever the market is offering you (from its perspective) at any  
given "now moment." The first objective is to integr ate as a dominant belief, "I objectively identify my 
edges." The challenge now is, how do you get there? How do you transform yourself into a pers on who 
can consistently think in the market's perspective? The process of transformation starts with you r desire 
and your willingness to refocus on the object of your de sire (self-discipline). Desire is a force. It does 
not have to coincide or agree with anything that you currently believe to be true about the nature of 
trading.  
A clear desire aimed squarely at a specific objective is a very powerful tool. You can use the force  of 
your desire to create an entirely new version or dimension to your identity; shift energy between two or 
more conflicting concepts; or change the context or polarity of your memories from  negative to 
positive. I'm sure you are familiar with the sayi ng, "Make up your mind." The implication of "making 
up our minds" is that we decide exactly what we desire with so much clarity (absolutely no lingering 
doubts) and with so much convictio n that literally nothing stands in our way, either internally or 
externally. If there's enough force behind our resolve,  it's possible to experience a major shift in our 
mental structure virtually instantaneously.  
De-activating internal conflicts is not a function of time; it's a function-focused desire (although it can 
take a considerable amount of time to get to the po int where we really make up our minds). Otherwise, 
in the absence of extreme clarity and conviction, the technique of self-discipline, over time, will do the 
job quite nicely (if, of course, you're willing to use it). To get there, you must "make up your mind," 
with as much conviction and clarity as possible, that more than anything else you desire consistency 
(the state of mind of trust, confidence, and objectivity) from your trading. This is necessary beca use if 
you're like most traders, you're going to be up against some very formidable conflicting forc es. For 
example, if you've been trading to get high from the euphoria of catching a big move, to impress your 
family and friends, to be a hero, to fulfill an addiction to random rewards, to be right a bout your 
predictions, or for any other reason that has nothing to do with being consistent, then you'll fi nd the 
force of these other motivations will not only act as an obstacle making the trading exercise I'm about 
to give you veiy difficult, but it could very well be strong enough even to keep yo u from doing the 
exercise at all. Remember the boy who had no desire to be like the other childre n and interact with 
dogs? In essence, he decided to live with the active contradiction between his minimally charged 
positive belief that not all dogs are dangerous and his core, negatively charged belief that all dogs are 
dangerous. He had the ability to perceive friendly dogs, but at the same time found it impossible to 
interact with them. Unless he desires to change it , the imbalance of energy between these two beliefs 
will stay exactly as it is for his entire life.  
To even start this process, you have to want consis tency so much that you would be willing to give up 
all the other reasons, motivations, or agendas you have for trading that aren't consiste nt with the 
process of integrating the beliefs that create consistency. A clear, intense desire is an absolute 
prerequisite if you're going to make this process work for you.  
 
EXERCISE: LEARNING TO TRADE AND EDGE LIKE A CASINO’ 
 
The object of this exercise is to convince yourself that trading is just a simple game of probabi lities 
(numbers), not much different from pulling the handl e of a slot machine. At the micro level, the 
outcomes to individual edges are independent occurrences and random in relationsh ip to one another. 
At the macro level, the outcomes over a series of  trades will produce consistent results. From a 
probabilities perspective, this mean s that instead of being the person playing the slot machine, as a 
trader, you can be the casino, if:  
 
1. you have an edge that genuinely puts the odds of success in your favor;  
2. you can think about trading in the appropriat e manner (the five fundamental truths); and  
3. you can do everything you need to do over a series  of trades. Then, like the casinos, you will own the 
game and be a consistent winner.  
 
 
 
 
 
SETTING UP THE EXERCISE  
Pick a market. 
 Choose one actively traded stock or futures contract to  trade. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it's 
liquid and you can afford the margin requirements for trading at least three hundred shares or three 
futures contracts per trade.  
 
Choose a set of market variables that define an edge. This can be any trading system you want. The 
trading system or methodology you choose can be mathematical, mechanical, or visu al (based on 
patterns in price charts). It doesn't matter whether you personally design the system or p urchase it from 
someone else, nor do you need to take a long time or be too picky trying to find or develop the best or 
right system. This exercise is not about system development and it is not a test of your  analytical 
abilities. In fact, the variables you choose can even be  considered mediocre by most traders' standards, 
because what you are going to learn from doing this exercise is not dependent upon whether you 
actually make money.  
If you consider this exercise an educational expense,  it will cut down on the amount of time and effort 
you might otherwise expend trying to find the most profitable edges. For those of you who might be 
wondering, I'm not going to make any specific recommendations about what system or va riables you 
should use, because I assume that most of the people reading this book are already well schooled in 
technical analysis. If you need addi tional assistance, there are hundreds of books available on the topic, 
as well as system vendors who are more than willing to sell you their ideas. However, if you've made a 
genuine attempt to do this on your own but are still having problems picking a system, you can contact 
me at markdouglas.com or tradinginthezone.com and I will make some recommendations. Whatever 
system you choose to use has to fit within the following specifications.  
 
Trade Entry. The variables you use to define your edge have to be absolutely precise. The s ystem has 
to be designed so that it does not require you to make any subjective decisions or judg ments about 
whether your edge is present. If the market is aligned in a way that conforms with the rigid variabl es of 
your system, then you have a trade; if not, then you don't have a trade. Period! No other extraneous or 
random factors can enter into the equation.  
 
Stop-Loss Exit. The same conditions apply to getting out of a trade that's not working. Your 
methodology has to tell you exactly how much you need to risk to find out if the trade is going to work. 
There is always an optimum point at which the possibility of a trade not working is so diminishe d, 
especially in relationship to the profit potential, th at you're better off taking your loss and getting your 
mind clear to act on the next edge. Let the market structure determine where this optimum point is, 
rather than using an arbitrary dollar amount that you are willing to risk on a trade. In any case, 
whatever system you choose, it has to be absolutely exact, requiring no subjective decision making. 
Again, no extraneous or random variables can enter into the equation.  
 
Time Frame. Your trading methodology can be in any time frame that suits you, but all your entry and 
exit signals have to be DUSCCi Hi cne same time frame. For example, if you use variables that i dentify 
a particular support and resistance pattern on a 30-minute bar chart, then your risk and profit ob jective 
calculations also have to be determined in a 30-mi nute time frame. However, trading in one time frame 
does not preclude you from using other time frames as fi lters. For example, you could have as a filter a 
rule that states you're only going to take trades that are in the direction of the major trend. There's an 
old trading axiom that "The trend is your friend." It means that you have a higher pro bability of success 
when you trade in the direction of the major trend, if there is one. In fact, the lowest-risk trade, with the 
highest probability of success, occurs when you are buying dips (support) in an up-trending market or 
selling rallies (resistance) in a down-trending market. To illustrate how this rule  works, let's say that 
you've chosen a precise way of identifying support and resistance patterns in a 30- minute tim e frame 
as your edge. The rule is that you are only going to take trades in the direction of the major trend. A 
trending market is defined as a series of higher highs and higher lows for an up -trending market and a 
series of lower highs and lower lows for a downtrending market. The longer the time fram e, the more 
significant the trend, so a trending market on a daily bar chart is more significant than a tren ding 
market on a 30-minute bar chart. Therefore, the trend on the daily bar chart would take precedence  over 
the trend on the 30-minute bar chart and would be considered the major trend.  
To determine the direction of the major trend, look at what is happening on a daily bar c hart. If the 
trend is up on the daily, you are only going to look for a sell-off or retracement down to what your ed ge 
defines as support on the 30-minute chart. That's where you will become  a buyer. On th e other hand, if 
the trend is down on the daily, you are only going to look for a rally up to what you r edge defines as a 
resistance level to be a seller on the 30-minute ch art. Your objective is to determine, in a down-
trending market, how far it can rally on an intraday basis and still not violate the symmetr y of the 
longer trend. In an up-trending market, your object ive is to determine how far it can sell off on an 
intraday basis without violating the symmetry of th e longer trend. There's usually very little risk 
associated with these intraday support and resistance points, because you don't have to let the market 
go very far beyond them to tell you the trade isn't working.  
 
Taking Profits. Believe it or not, of all the skills one needs to learn to be a consistently successful 
trader, learning to take profits is probably the most difficult to master. A multitude of  personal, often 
very complicated psychological factors, as well as the effectiveness of one's market analysis, enter into  
the equation. Unfortunately, sorting out this complex matrix of issues goes way beyond the sc ope of 
this book. I point this out so that those of you who might be inclined to beat your selves up for leaving 
money on the table can relax and give yourselves a break. Even after you've acquired all the other 
skills, it might take a very long time before you get th is one down pat. Don't despair. There is a way to 
set up a profit-taking regime that at least fulfills the objective of the fifth principle of cons istency ("I 
pay myself as the market makes money available to me").  
If you're going to establish a belief in yourself that you're a consistent winner, the n you will have to 
create experiences that correspond with that belief.  Because the object of the belief is winning 
consistently, how you take profits in a winning trade is of paramount importance. This is t he only part 
of the exercise in which you will have some degree  of discretion about what you do. The underlying 
premise is that, in a winning trade, you never know how  far the market is going to go in your direction. 
Markets rarely go straight up or straight down. (Many of the NASDAQ Internet stocks in the fall of 
1999 were an obvious exception to this statement.) Typically, markets go up and then retrace some 
portion of the upward move; or go down and then retrace some portion of the downward m ove. These 
proportional reiracerr^nts can make it very difficult to stay in a winning trade. You would have to be an 
extremely sophisticated and objective analyst to make the distinction between a normal retracement, 
when the market still has the potential to move in the original direction of your trade , and a retracement 
that isn't normal, when the potential for any further movement in the original direction of  your trade is 
greatly diminished, if not nonexistent.  
If you never know how far the market is going to go in your direction, then when and how do you take 
profits? The question of when is a function of your ability to read the market and pick the most likely 
spots for it to stop. In the absence of an ability to do this objectively,  the best course of action from a 
psychological perspective is to divide your position in to thirds (or quarters), and scale out the position 
as the market moves in your favor. If you are trading futures contracts, this means your minim um 
position for a trade is at least three (or four) contracts. For stocks, the minimum p osition is any number 
of shares that is divisible by three (or four), so you don't end up with an odd-lot order. Here's the way I 
scale out of a winning position. When I first started trading, especially during the first three years (1979 
through 1981), I would thoroughly and regularly analyze the results of my  trading activities. One of the 
things I discovered was that I rarely got stopped out of a trade for a loss, without the market first going 
at least a little way in my direction. On average, only one out of every ten trades  was an immediate 
loser that never went in my direction. Out of the other 25 to 30 percent of the trades that were 
ultimately losers, the market usually went in my direction by three or four tics before revisi ng and 
stopping me out. I calculated that if I got into the habit of taking at least a third of my origin al position 
off every time the market gave me those three or four tics, at the end of the year the accumulated 
winnings would go a long way towards paying my expenses. I was right. To this day, I a lways, without 
reservation or hesitation, take of f a portion of a winning position whenever the market gives me a little 
to take.  
How much that might be depends on the market; it will be a different amount in each cas e. For 
example, in Treasury bond futures, I take a third of my position off when I ge t four tics. In the S&P 
futures, I take a third off for a profit of one and a half to two full points. In a bond trade, I usually don' t 
risk more than six tics to find out if the trade is  going to work. Using a three-contract trade as an 
example, here's how it works: If I get into a position and the market immediately goes agai nst me 
without giving me at least four tics first, I get st opped out of the trade for an 18-tic loss, but as I've 
indicated, this doesn't happen often. More likely , the trade goes in my favor by some small amount 
before becoming a loser. If it goes in my favor by at least four tics, I take those four tics on one 
contract. What I have done is reduce my total risk on the other two contracts by 10 tics. If the market 
then stops me out of the last two contracts, the net loss on the trade is only 8 tics. If I don't get stopped 
out on the last two contracts and the market moves in my direction, I take the next thir d of the position 
off at some predetermined profit objective.  
This is based on some longer time frame support or resistance, or on the test of a previous significant 
high or low. When I take profits on the second third,  I also move the stop-loss to my original entry 
point. Now I have a net profit on the trade regardless of what happens to the last third of the position. 
In other words, I now have a "ris k-free opportunity." I can't emphasize enough nor can the publisher 
make the words on this page big enough to stress how important it is for you to expe rience the state of 
"risk-free opportunity." When you set up a situation in  which there is "risk-free  opportunity," there's no 
way to lose unless something extremely unusual happens, like a limit up or limit down move through 
your stop. If, under normal circumstances, there's no way to lose, you get to experience what it rea lly 
feels like to be in a trade with a relaxed, carefree state of mind. To illustrate this point, imagine that you 
are in a winning trade; the market made a fairly significant move in your direction, bu t you didn't take 
any profits because you thought it was going even further.  
However, instead of going further, the market trades all the way back to or very close to you r original 
entry point. You panic and, as a result, liquidate the trade, because you don't want to let what was once 
a winning trade turn into a loser. But as soon as you're out, the market bounces right back into wha t 
would have been a winning trade. If you had locked in  some profits by scaling out, putting yourself in a 
riskfree opportunity situation, it s very unlikely that you would have  panicked or felt any stress or 
anxiety for that matter. I still have a third of my position left. What now? I look for the most likel y 
place for the market to stop. This is  usually a significant high or low in a longer time frame. I place my 
order to liquidate just below that spot in a long position or just above that spot in a short position. I 
place my orders just above or just below because I don't care about squeezing the last tic out of the 
trade. I have found over the years that trying to do that just isn't worth it. One other fact or you need to 
take into consideration is your risk-to-reward ratio. The risk-to-reward ratio is the dollar value of how 
much risk you have to take relative to the profit potential. Ideally, your risk-to-reward ratio sh ould be at 
least 3:1, which means you are only risking one dollar for every three dollars of profit potential. If your 
edge and the way you scale out of your trades give you a 3:1 risk-to-reward ratio, your wi nning trade 
percentage can be less than 50 percent and you will still make money consistently. A 3:1 risk-t o-reward 
ratio is ideal. However, for the purposes of this exer cise, it doesn't matter what it is, nor does it matter 
how effectively you scale out, as long as you do it. Do the best you can to pay yourself at reasonable 
profit levels when the market makes the money available. Every port ion of a trade that you take off as a 
winner will contribute to your belief that you are a consistent winner. All the numbers will  eventually 
come into better alignment as your belief in yo ur ability to be consistent becomes stronger.  
 
Trading in Sample Sizes. The typical trader practically lives or di es (emotionally) on the results of the 
most recent trade. If it was a winner, he'll gladly go to the next trade; if it  wasn't, he'll start questioning 
the viability of his edge. To find out what variables work, how well they work, and what  doesn't work, 
we need a systematic approach, one that doesn't take any random variables into consideration. This  
means that we have to expand our definition of success or failure from the limited trade-by-trade 
perspective of the typical trader to a sample size of 20 trades or more. Any edge you decide on wi ll be 
based on some limited number of market variables or relationships between those va riables that 
measure the market's potential to move either up or down. From the market's perspective, each t rader 
who has the potential to put on or take off a trade can act as a force on price movement and is , 
therefore, a market variable. No edge or technical system can take into consideration every trader and  
his reasons for putting on or taking off a trade. As a result, any set of market variables that defines an 
edge is like a snapshot of something very fluid, captu ring only a limited portio n of all the possibilities. 
When you apply any set of variables to the market, they may work very well over an extended pe riod 
of time, but after a while you may find that thei r effectiveness diminishes. That's because the 
underlying dynamics of the interaction between all the participants (the market) is changing. New 
traders come into the market with their own unique ideas of what is high and what is low, and other 
traders leave.  
Little by little, these changes affect the underlying dynamics of how the mark et moves. No snapshot 
(rigid set of variables) can take these subtle changes into consideration. You can comp ensate for these 
subtle changes in the underlying dynamics of market movement and still maintain a consiste nt 
approach by trading in sample sizes. Your sample size has to be large enough to give your variables a 
fair and adequate test, but at the same time small e nough so that if their effectiveness diminishes, you 
can detect it before you lose an inordinate amount of money. I have found that a sa mple size of at least 
20 trades fulfills both of these requirements.  
 
Testing. Once you decide on a set of variables that conform to these specific ations, you need to test 
them to see how well they work. If you have the appropriate software to do this, you ar e probably 
already familiar with the procedures. If you don't have testing software, you can either forwar d test 
your variables or hire a testing service to do it for you. If you need a recommendation for a testing 
service, contact me at markdouglas.com or tradinginthezone.com for a referral. In any case, keep in 
mind that the object of the exercise is to use trading as a vehicle to learn how to think objectively (in 
the market's perspective), as if you were a casino operator. Right now, the bottom-line performance of 
your system isn't very important, but it is important that you have a good idea of what you can expect 
in the way of a win-to-loss ratio (the number of wi nning trades relative to th e number of losing trades 
for your sample size).  
 
Accepting the Risk. A requirement of this exercise is that you know in advance exactly what your risk 
is on each trade in your 20- trade sample size. As you now know, knowing the risk and accepting the 
risk are two different things. I want you to be as comfortable as possible with the dollar value of the 
risk you are taking in this exercise. Becuse the exercise requires that you use a 20-trade sample size, the 
potential risk is that you will lose on all 20 trades. This is obviously the worst-case scenario. It is as 
likely an occurrence as that you willwin on all 20 tr ades, which means it isn't very likely. Nevertheless, 
it is a possibility. Therefore, you should set up the exercise in such a way that you can accept the risk  
(in dollar value) of losing on all 20 trades.  
For example, if you're trading S&P futures, your edge might require that you risk three full points per 
contract to find out if the trade is going to work. Since the exercise requires that you trade a minimum 
of three contracts per trade, the total dollar value of the risk per trade is $2,250, if you  use big contracts. 
The accumulated dollar value of risk if you lose on all 20 trades is $45,000, You may not be 
comfortable risking $45,000 on this exercise.  
If you're not comfortable, you can reduce the dollar value of the risk by trading S&P mini contracts (E-
Mini). They are one-fifth the value of the big contract s, so the total dollar value of the risk per trade 
goes down to $450 and the accumulated risk for all 20 trades is $9,000. You can do the same thing if 
you are trading stocks: Just keep on reducing the number of shares per trade until you get to a point 
where you are comfortable with the total accumulated risk for all 20 trades. What I don't want you to 
do is change your established risk parameters to satisfy your comfort levels.  
If, based on your research, you have determined that a three-point risk in the S&Ps is the optimu m 
distance you must let the market trade against your edge to tell you it isn' t worth staying in the position, 
then leave it at three points. Change this variable only if it is warranted from a technical analysis 
perspective. If you've done everything possible to re duce your position size and find that you still aren't 
comfortable with the accumulated dollar value of lo sing on all 20 trades, then I suggest you do the 
exercise with a simulated brokerage service. With a simulated brokerage service, everything about the 
process of putting on and taking off trades, including fills and brokerage statem ents, is exactly the same 
as with an actual brokerage firm, except that the trades are not actually entered into the market. As a 
result, you don't actually have any money at risk. A simulated brokerage service is an  excellent tool to 
practice with in real time, under real market conditions ; it is also an excellent tool for forward testing a 
trading system. There may be others, but the only service of this nature that I know of is 
Auditrack.com.  
 
Doing the Exercise. When you have a set of variables that conforms to the specifications described, 
you know exactly what each trade is going to cost to find out if it's going to work, you have a plan for 
taking profits, and you know what you can expect as a win-loss ratio for your sample size, then you are 
ready to begin the exercise. The rules are simple: Trade your system exactly as you have designed it. 
This means you have to commit yourself to trading at least the next 20 occurrences of your edge—not 
just the next trade or the next couple of trades, but all 20, no matter what. You cannot deviate, use or be  
influenced by any other extraneous factors, or change the variables that define your edge until you ha ve 
completed a full sample size. By setting up the exercise with rigid variables that define your ed ge, 
relatively fixed odds, and a commitment to take every trade in your sample size, you have c reated a 
trading regime that duplicates how a casino operates.  
Why do casinos make consistent money on an event that has a random outcome? Because they know 
that over a series of events, the odds are in their favor. They also know that to realize the benefit s of the 
favorable odds, they have to participate in every event. They can't engage in a process of pi cking and 
choosing which hand of blackjack, spin of the roulette wheel, or roll of the dice they are going to 
participate in, by trying to predict in advance the outcome of each of these individual events.  If you 
believe in the five fundamental truths and you believ e that trading is just a probability game, not much 
different from pulling the handle of a slot machin e, then you'll find that this exercise will be 
effortless—effortless b ecause your desire to follow through with your commitment to take every trade 
in your sample size and your belief in the probabilistic nature of trading will be in complete harmony. 
As a result, there will be no fear, resistance, or distracting thoughts. What could stop you from doing 
exactly what you need to do, when you need to do it, without reservation or hesitation? Nothing!  
On the other hand, if it hasn't already occurred to you, this exercise is going to create a head- on 
collision between your desire to thin k objectively in probabilities and all the forces inside you that are 
in conflict with this desire. The amount of difficulty you have in doing this exercise will be in  direct 
proportion to the degree to which these conflicts exis t. To one degree or anot her, you will experience 
the exact opposite of what I described in the previous paragraph. Don't be surprise d if you find your 
first couple of attempts at doing this exercise virtually impossible. How should you handle  these 
conflicts? Monitor yourself and use th e technique of self-discipline to refocus on your objective. Write 
down the five fundamental truths and the seven principles of consistency, and keep them in fr ont of you 
at all times when you are trading.  
Repeat them to yourself frequently, with conviction. Every time you notice that you  are thinking, 
saying, or doing something that is inconsistent with these truths or principles, acknowledge  the conflict. 
Don't try to deny the existence of conflicting forces. They are simply parts of your psyche tha t are 
(understandably) arguing for their versions of the truth. When this happens, refocus on  exactly what 
you are trying to accomplish. If your purpose is to think objectively, disrupt the associati on process (so 
you can stay in the "now moment opportunity flow"); step through your fears of being wrong, losing 
money, missing out, and leaving money on the table (so you can stop making errors and sta rt trusting 
yourself), then you'll know exactly what you need to do. Follow the rules of your tra ding regime as best 
you can. Doing exactly what your rules call for wh ile focused on the five fundamental truths will 
eventually resolve all your conflicts about the true  nature of trading. Every time you actually do 
something that confirms one of the five fundament al truths, you will be dr awing energy out of the 
conflicting beliefs and adding energy to a belief in probabilities and in your ability to produce 
consistent results. Eventually, your new beliefs will become so powerful that it will take no co nscious 
effort on your part to think and act in a way that is consistent with your objectives.  
You will know for sure that thinki ng in probabilities is a functioning part of your identity when you 
will be able to go through one sample size of at least 20 or more trades without any difficu lty, 
resistance, or conflicting thoughts distracting you from doing exactly what your mechanical system 
calls for. Then, and only then, will you be ready to  move into the more advanced subjective or intuitive 
stages of trading.  
 
A FINAL NOTE 
 
Try not to prejudge how long it will take before you can get through at least one sample size of trades, 
following your plan without deviation, distracting thought s, or hesitation to act. It will take as long as it 
takes. If you wanted to be a prof essional golfer, it wouldn't  be unusual to dedicate yourself to hitting 
10,000 or more golf balls until the precise combination of movements in your swing were so ingrained 
in your muscle memory that you no longer had to think about it consciously. When you're out there 
hitting those golf balls, you aren't playing an actual game against some one or winning the big 
tournament. You do it because you believe that skill acquisition and practice wil l help you win. 
Learning to be a consistent winner as a trader isn't any different. I wish you gr eat prosperity, and would 
say "good luck," but you really won't need luck if you work at acquiring the app ropriate skills.
