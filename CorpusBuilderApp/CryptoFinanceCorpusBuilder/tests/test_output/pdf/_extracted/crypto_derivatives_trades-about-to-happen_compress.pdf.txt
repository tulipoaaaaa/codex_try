Foreword

“

When you go fishin’ in a lake, you don’t just row out to the middle 

and throw a line in the water. You go where the fish live—around 
the edges and near the sunken trees. Same way, you enter trades near the 
edges of congestion zones, where bulls or bears are so exhausted that a small 
amount of pressure can reverse a trend.”

xi

I’ve often heard these and other pronouncements, delivered in David’s 
Southern drawl, in my Traders’ Camps. Now it is a pleasure to see them in 
his book, available to you even if you can’t travel to a week‐long Camp and 
study with David in person.

David is a quiet man who spends day after day in solitude in his trading 
room, but he has played a large role in the development of many serious 
traders. When discussing markets with friends, I often hear: “This is where 
David would draw a line.” His way of reading charts has been taken up by 
hundreds of his students.

Expanding  on  classical  works  of  Richard  Wyckoff,  written  almost  a 
century ago, David has built a modern superstructure of market analysis. 
The changing heights of price bars, accompanied by rising or falling bars 
of volume are the basic irreducible elements from which David builds his 
market analysis. He uses these patterns to read the behavior of crowds across 
all markets and timeframes—and then to place his orders.

All trades leave indelible tracks on price and volume charts. David focus-
es on them—and these charts speak to him. Now, in this book, he teaches 
you to read their language.

David’s sharp focus on price/volume behavior reminds me of a teacher 
I had in medical school. She was shy and a little deaf, and usually stood in 

flast.indd   11

the back during grand rounds. We knew that she was so observant and so 
attuned to patients’ body language that when professors disagreed about a 
diagnosis, they’d ask for her opinion. A person who watches intently, on the 
basis of a great deal of experience and without any hidden agenda can see 
deeper than most.

A careful reading of this book will open your eyes to the huge importance 
of false breakouts—what David calls springs (when they point down) and 
upthrusts (when they point up). He promises: “once you become attuned to 
the behavior of a spring and upthrust your eyes will be opened to an action 
signal that works in all time periods. The spring can provide the impetus 
for  a  short‐term  pop  playable  by  day‐traders  or  serve  as  the  catalyst  for 
long‐term capital gains.”

Having sat for hours in the back of the room while David was lecturing 
and showing trade examples, false breakouts have become one of my key 
patterns  to  trade.  Now  you  can  be  guided  through  dozens  of  charts  by 
David, moving forward bar by bar, as you learn to read their messages and 
anticipate trend reversals.

The  chapter  on  absorption  will  teach  you  to  gauge  the  strength  of 
the  current  trend.  Is  that  trend  moving  forward  like “the  Greek  phalanx 
marching in step across the Plain of Troy” as David puts it—or is its advance 
being absorbed by growing supply, which precedes a reversal? Now, as your 
eyes  move  across  David’s  charts,  you’ll  see  how  their  price  and  volume 
patterns reveal their secret weaknesses or strengths.

Do not rush as you read this book. To fully benefit from it you need to 
let its many messages sink in. Be sure to apply David’s concepts to current 
charts, watch them open up to you and become more meaningful before 
returning to the book and studying another dozen pages. This isn’t a quickie 
book—it took David years to write, and the more attention you give it, the 
deeper will be your benefit.

Happy reading and happy trading!

I am totally indebted to my long-time friend, Dr. Alex Elder, who has al-

lowed me to take part in his exotic trading camps. He has been the driving 
force behind the writing of this book. He has always been willing to offer 
support and helpful suggestions, and he opened the doors to make the pub-
lication by Wiley possible. I am also grateful to the help received from Alfred 
Tagher  and  Bob  Fulks. They  have  been  instrumental  in  the  programming 
of my custom charting tools. Also, to my many students whose needs have 
helped me crystallize different approaches to teaching the Wyckoff material. 
As a former teacher, I consider their successes to be my greatest reward.

Introduction

Richard  Wyckoff  came  to  Wall  Street  in  1888.  The  details  of  his 

40‐year career are chronicled in his autobiography, Wall Street Ventures 
and Adventures (1930). The tales of the large operators he observed and the 
inside story of their manipulative campaigns make interesting reading. But 
his search to develop a “trained judgment” for trading offers the most com-
pelling  and  inspiring  story.  Describing  his  progress  as  of  1905, Wyckoff 
wrote:

1

I had now spent the greater part of seventeen years in Wall Street—as 
a boy, clerk, silent partner and managing partner in Stock Exchange 
houses. But with all I had seen, studied, and observed, I had yet no well‐
defined plan or method for money‐making in the stock market, either 
for my clients or for myself.1

Up to this point in his career, two threads wind through his experiences. 
First,  big  traders  spend  hours  studying  stock  transactions  as  they  appear 
on  the  ticker  tape.  Second,  he  saw  the  need  for  a  college  or  educational 
service  to  teach  the “inner  workings  of  the  stock  market.”  He  wanted  to 
show how the public was repeatedly bilked by the large manipulators in the 
market. In late 1907, as Wall Street suffered from the aftershock of another 
panic, Wyckoff  decided  to  write  an  educational  publication—a  monthly 
magazine called The Ticker—consisting of articles about the stock market. 
The bulk of the writing rested on Wyckoff’s shoulders, and the pressure to

find new material led him into many facets of the stock, bond, and com-
modity markets. He tested mechanical trading methods based on statistics 
and numerous theories presented to him by readers. While he ultimately 
moved in a different direction, he realized that charts provided a better re-
cord of price history than pure statistics. As his study of charts and stock 
market techniques progressed, he turned to the ticker tape. “I saw more and 
more that the action of stocks reflected the plans and purposes of those who 
dominated them. I began to see possibilities of judging from the very tape 
what these master minds were doing.”2 Under the guidance of a former floor 
trader at the stock exchange, Wyckoff began a serious study of tape reading. 
His observations became the impetus for a series of tape reading articles in 
The Ticker and his readers clamored for more. This original series of articles 
provided the material for Wyckoff’s first book, Studies in Tape Reading, pub-
lished in 1910 under the pseudonym Rollo Tape. About this book, Wyckoff 
later wrote in his autobiography:

The purpose of the self‐training and the continued application of the 
methods  suggested  in  Studies  in Tape  Reading  was  to  develop  an  in-
tuitive  judgment,  which  would  be  the  natural  outcome  of  spending   
twenty‐seven hours a week at the ticker over many months and years.3

In  the  next  few  years,  the  price  swings  in  stocks  became  larger,  and 
Wyckoff  applied  his  tape  reading  methods  to  the  broader  movements  of 
the market. The public demanded more frequent trading recommendations 
with less emphasis on the analysis. This spawned his Trend Letter, a weekly 
one‐page sheet containing a list of trades. It grew in popularity until its fol-
lowing became too large and unwieldy causing Wyckoff to seek privacy. He 
ended the publication in 1917 after achieving the largest following of any 
individual on Wall Street since the 1890s.

Wyckoff did not drift into obscurity. He wrote several more books. The 
Ticker was transformed into the Magazine of Wall Street, with which he was heav-
ily involved until declining health forced his retirement in 1926. In the final 
years of his life, Wyckoff returned to the idea of educating the public and con-
ceived a Wall Street college. His health dictated a less monumental effort. In 
1932, he turned his attention to a course explaining his method of trading in 
stocks. The original course was divided into two divisions: Division one, A

Course of Instruction in Stock Market Science and Technique; and Division Two, A 
Course of Instruction in Tape Reading and Active Trading. Wyckoff died in 1934.

Since 1934, the “Wyckoff course,” as it is known, has preserved Wyckoff’s 
place in the pantheon of market masters. Thousands of traders and inves-
tors have taken the course, which is still offered today by the Stock Market 
Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. over the past 80 years, the course has been 
modified and updated to accommodate changes in market conditions with-
out  disturbing Wyckoff’s  original  work.  It  contains  the  specific  details  of  
Wyckoff’s  trading/analytical  methods.  His  chapter  on  “Determining  the 
Trend of the Market by the Vertical Bar chart of the NY Times Average of 
50 Stocks” captures the essence of his work and provides the guiding light 
for my book.

Many  students  who  take  the Wyckoff  course  today  focus  on  the  models 
of accumulation and distribution. Wyckoff never devised such an interpreta-
tion of accumulation and distribution. They were added after his death. He 
certainly discussed some of the features of market behavior that were incor-
porated into these models. Accumulation and distribution are taught today as 
behavior revealed on bar charts with volume. Yet, when Wyckoff mentioned 
these terms, it was mostly in regard to point‐and‐figure charts and never with 
specific components. It is my opinion that these models were created by his 
former associates to add specificity to the course. As expressed in his autobi-
ography, Wyckoff wanted to teach students how to develop a trader’s feel—
intuition. Specificity sells better than intuition; it’s more tangible. I believe 
there is too much dependency on recognizing patterns of behavior rather than 
on the art of reading bar charts. These patterns can quickly become cookie 
prints, like geometric formations, into which price movement is stuffed by 
those looking for a quick, no‐think fix. They lead to rigid rather than creative 
thinking. They often frustrate the new student of Wyckoff analysis who might 
not realize the world of chart reading is gray, not black or white. one has to 
have an open mind rather than being fixed on a preconceived ideal. While the 
metaphors  created  by  Bob  Evans,  a  famous  teacher  of  the Wyckoff  course, 
describing springs, up‐thrusts, ice lines, and so on, are colorful and instruc-
tive, Wyckoff never used such terminology; however, that does not make them 
forbidden or useless. on the contrary, they are very helpful. Wyckoff was first 
and foremost a tape reader. As the markets grew more robust and volatile, he 
applied his tape reading skills to bar chart reading, where emphasis is placed 
on price range, position of the close, and volume. Wyckoff obviously knew the 
importance of trend lines, channels, and support/resistance lines; however, 
they are given greater coverage in the modern course.

I have borrowed from Wyckoff’s original writings as well as the concepts 
of  Bob  Evans.  My  approach,  which  incorporates  price  range,  close,  and  
volume, also utilizes what I call “the story of the lines,” that is, the story of 
the price/volume behavior as framed and interconnected by lines drawn on 
charts. The lines bring the price movement into focus and guide one toward 
the behavior that prompts action in the market. Thus, I am trying to find 
trades on charts rather than figuring out if accumulation or distribution is 
taking place. A real gold mine of information lies in Wyckoff’s method of 
reading bar charts. It has become a lost art.

The purpose of my book is to show how one can logically interpret bar 
charts and wave charts to find trades about to happen. By studying the chart 
examples in this book, I believe the reader will gain tremendous insight into 
reading  what  markets  say  about  themselves.  It  may  seem  tedious  at  first, 
but, through practice and repetition (repetition is the mother of wisdom!), 
it will become second nature. It will give you the ability to locate turning 
points of different degrees.

In the studies that appear throughout this book, we will:

 ■ compare effort of the buying or selling with the reward (i.e., volume 

versus upward or downward progress).

 ■ Watch for ease of movement or lack of movement (i.e., wide price bars 

versus narrow price bars).

 ■ consider the meaning of the close within the range of a price bar.

 ■ Watch for shortening of upward or downward thrust.

 ■ Watch  for  follow‐through  or  lack  of  follow‐through  after  penetrations 
of support/resistance (this includes the notion of springs and upthrusts).

 ■ Watch for tests of high‐volume or “vertical” areas where price accelerated 

upward or downward.

 ■ consider  the  interaction  of  price  with  trend  lines,  channels,  and  
support/resistance lines, which often highlight the price/volume story.

In the second half of this book, I will introduce adaptations I have made to 
Wyckoff’s original tape‐reading tools, which are better suited for the enor-
mous volatility of today’s stock and futures markets. These can be applied to 
intraday and daily price movement, and software has been created for use in

real time. To find trades on any type of chart, we will be guided by the fol-
lowing statement, made long ago by Richard Wyckoff:

Successful tape reading [chart reading] is a study of Force. It requires 
ability to judge which side has the greatest pulling power and one must 
have the courage to go with that side. There are critical points which 
occur in each swing just as in the life of a business or of an individual. 
At these junctures it seems as though a feather’s weight on either side 
would  determine  the  immediate  trend. Any  one  who  can  spot  these 
points has much to win and little to lose.4

After reading this book, I guarantee you will never go back to the previ-
ous way you viewed charts. I have no secrets and will teach all I know about 
Wyckoff and price/volume behavior. confucius said: “A true teacher is one 
who knows (and makes known) the New, by revitalizing the old.”

Where to Find 
Trades

An Overview

7

Finding trades is like finding fish. Fish can be randomly caught in any part 

of a lake, but they tend to congregate in specific areas at different times 
of the year. Similarly, big trades can be hooked at any point on a chart, but 
they appear with greater frequency around the edges of trading ranges.

Trading  ranges  do  not  have  set  patterns.  Prices  may  twist  and  turn  in 
a myriad of ways before a trading range is resolved. In general, however, 
trading ranges are rectangular shaped with prices swinging back and forth 
between the upper and lower boundaries or coiling into apexes. But we are 
concerned with the dynamics of trading ranges rather than any geometrical 
shape. When trading ranges evolve over many months or years, they often 
expand their boundaries and contain numerous smaller ranges. The bound-
aries of trading ranges are repeatedly tested and/or penetrated as the buyers 
and sellers struggle for dominance. Whenever the boundaries are breached, 
follow‐through or the lack of follow‐through becomes the deciding factor. 
After breakouts or breakdowns occur, prices often retest these areas.

In the next few chapters, we will examine the characteristics of price/
volume behavior at these various points. Keep in mind we are dealing with 
trading ranges of all sizes and not solely at tops or bottoms. The behavior 
described  here  occurs  on  all  charts  regardless  of  their  time  period. With 
practice, one can readily identify the behavior areas circled on Figure 1.1. 

c01.indd   7

3/21/2013   3:03:47 PM

The first step involves drawing the trading ranges—a seemingly easy task 
that requires an eye for horizontal relationships.

Figure  1.1  Where to Find Trades diagram

Look  at  the  six  trading  ranges  (Tr1–Tr6)  on  Figure  1.2  of  nasdaq  
futures. By repeatedly framing the support and resistance lines, we see how 
trends consist of individual ranges and the turning points emerge from the 
otherwise  tangle  of  price  movement. These  turning  points—springs,  up-
thrusts,  absorption,  and  tests  of  breakout/breakdowns—serve  as  action 
signals.

In  later  chapters,  volume  will  be  incorporated  into  the  understanding 
of this price behavior. But, first, we will focus on the lines. reading a chart 
without lines is like studying a world map without boundary lines. It’s the 
subject of the next two chapters and serves as the first step in my method 
for reading charts.

Drawing Lines

11

So much of trading and technical analysis looks easy. On the Internet, for 

example, you can find all sorts of trading systems showing how trades 
were initiated at point A and sold at point B for a 3,000 percent profit in 
only four months. A book on technical analysis might glorify buying break-
outs or the breaking of a trend line. Trends do require breakouts in order 
to persist but, unfortunately, many fail. The penetration of a trend line per 
se guarantees little. What preceded the trend line break and the way it oc-
curred reveals more. Then we have the skeptics who fall back on the old 
saying, “Lines are drawn to be broken.” So what! Price movement evolves 
and we redraw.

Drawing support and resistance lines might seem the subject of Charting 
101. Some say it’s for beginners. But you would be surprised by how many 
people cannot tailor the placement of their lines to highlight the behavior 
within  a  trading  range.  Even  fewer  have  learned  to  recognize  horizontal 
lines around which prices have revolved. Let’s first look at a typical trading 
range and imagine we are examining Figure 2.1 of Level 3 Communications 
from the viewpoint of the right‐most day (December 26, 2003). We see a 
great deal of lateral movement after the September 25 high. A resistance 
line is drawn across this high, and the initial low on October 2 serves as the 
support line. Why did I choose these two points for resistance and support 
levels? The high and low on October 15 and 24 could have worked equally 
well—maybe even better as the top occurred on October 15. In real time, I 
might have framed the trading range with the October high‐low. But looking 
in retrospect from right to left, the two bold lines tell a better story. They 
dramatize the failures in October and November to move upward or lower. 

c02.indd   11

3/21/2013   3:04:29 PM

At two of these points, the sellers attempted to take control of the stock and 
drive prices lower. Each time, however, the buyers checked the decline 
and prices recovered. This is important information. It tells us the buyers 
remain dominant. The support line brings the struggle between the buy-
ers and sellers into focus. During the latter half of December, notice the 
lifting of supports as the buyers gradually overcame the selling pressure. 
Such a sustained rise in price with most of the closes near the daily highs 
tells a more bullish story than wide flailing action. It indicates the stock is 
in strong hands.

The resistance line drawn across the September 25 high was penetrated 
on October 14, where prices registered their highest close. At this point, 
the buyers were seemingly in control. On the following day, however, the 
sellers turned back the advance and drove prices back down into the trad-
ing range. This reversal action threatened the uptrend from the August low 
until prices refused to break down on October 24 and November 17. Notice 
the October high has not played any role during this trading range. A line 
of resistance did form across the November 4 high as it blocked the two 
rallies in December. It marked the high of a trading range that began from 
the October 24 low. It is not uncommon to see trading ranges within larger 
ranges—especially when they span several months.

Since the trading range in LVLT spanned about 20 percent of the October peak 
price, we have to consider it of intermediate size. On hourly charts, we find many 
small trading ranges that swing less than 1 percent from high to low. These may 
last only a few days at most. While the support/resistance lines may not always 
tell as vivid a story about failed opportunities as we saw in LVLT, they do show (in 
the case of a downtrend) the steady progression of lower lows and highs.

As demonstrated on the Agnico Eagle Mines hourly (Figure 2.2), the lines 
reveal how prices interact with previously drawn lines. Trading range AA’ 
dominates the chart. It contains a smaller range, BC, which fails to support 
the market. The breakdown to support line D leads to one last rally into the 
larger trading range. This rally ends with an upward spike on January 17,  
2012. The  weak  close  on  this  price  bar  revealed  the  presence  of  selling.  
Support  line  D  also  serves  as  an  axis  line  as  prices  repeatedly  tried  to  
recover from below it. The last of these occurred on the up‐move from sup-
port line E. By drawing these lines, the trader can anticipate price swings to 
peak or bottom around previous support/resistance lines. They become an 
important part of a trader’s arsenal—especially when combined with trend 
lines, channels, and price/volume behavior.

Some of the most useful axis lines appear on daily charts. On the March 
2006 bond daily chart (Figure 2.3), resistance line A, drawn across the late 
November  2005  high,  provided  support  in  January  2006  and  resistance 
twice in February 2006. The two rallies in February were tests of the break-
down below line A. The axis line alone does not reveal strength or weakness; 
nor does it signal to buy or sell. It simply shows a level that has repeatedly 
served  as  support  and  resistance.  Prices  may  have  revolved  around  it  for 
several weeks or months. Many times the final rally in a top formation or the 
final downswing in a bottom will occur along an axis line. What makes this 
line most meaningful is the price/volume behavior around it. But one first 
must learn to see the lines. With practice, you will be able to see all of the 
linear relationships at a glance.

When we draw these horizontal lines, we repeatedly see the false moves 
on either side of a trading range. Compare the false breakout on October 15  
in  LVLT  (Figure  2.1)  with  the  January  spike  in  March  bonds. All  of  this  
behavior stands out with the aid of the lines. Notice the small trading range 
in LVLT during July–August 2003. It, like the sell‐off on November 17, led 
to a bullish turnaround after a false breakdown. Trading ranges are horizon-
tal patterns. They are resolved in three ways: a long, drawn‐out period of 
lateral movement that tires out the most diehard longs; by the formation of 

c02.indd   14

3/21/2013   3:04:29 PM

 
an apex in which the amplitude of the price swings narrows to a point of 
equilibrium; or a false breakout/breakdown. In the chapters ahead, we will 
explain much more of this behavior.

Trend lines depict the angle of advance or decline. They are dynamic sup-
port and resistance lines as opposed to the static horizontal lines that frame 
trading  ranges.  In  a  downtrend,  a  trend  line  is  drawn  across  successively 
lower highs. It seems uncanny that a trend line can be drawn across highs, for 
example, in January and March, which later provides resistance in July and 
September. The resistance points in July and September are known as touch 
points—that is, places within a trend where rallies halted against the trend 
line. Touch points add validity to a trend line. In an uptrend, a trend line 
is drawn across the rising supports. It is called the demand line as it marks 
the point where buying repeatedly emerges. Similarly, the downtrend line 
across highs is called the supply line. As will be discussed, these are com-
bined to create trend channels.

Let’s begin with some samples of uptrend lines. Normally, they are drawn 
from the low point of a decline. We do not want to draw a trend line through 
price movement to reach the second anchor point. On the daily continu-
ation chart of the 10‐year Treasury note (Figure 2.4) we see the simplest 
uptrend line. The lows of November 4 and December 5 serve as the anchor 
points. This line provided support on three additional corrections. Although

prices broke slightly below the line at point 3, they quickly recovered to 
make a new high. You can immediately see the inherent risks in automati-
cally going short solely on the penetration of an uptrend line. As previously 
stated, the behavior prior to the trend line break and the way it occurs tell 
the story. After you finish reading this book, the bearish behavior prior to 
the January 25 breakdown will be apparent. Two months later the 10‐year 
fell below 10524.

Trend lines are drawn from the perspective of the last day on the chart. 
One  looks  across  the  chart  like  a  surveyor  staking  out  land  for  develop-
ment. A second daily LVLT chart (Figure 2.5) is shown through December 1,  
2005. Looking backward, we fit a minor trend line onto the rally from the 
October low. We do not use the precise low as the first anchor point. If we 
did, the line would not fit the angle of advance. Instead, we draw the line 
from  the  low  of  the  fourth  day  (point  1).  If  a  steep  uptrend  line  (“a”)  is 
drawn from this low, it will pass through price movement. The low at point 
2 is a better second anchor for the line is free and clear of other prices and 
it later provides support at point 3. One more factor: at point 2, we do not 
know  prices  will  continue  upward.  Connecting  points  1  and  2  creates  a

tentative line until the high at “b” is exceeded. A rally above “b” constitutes 
an uptrend. I am not so terribly rigid, for the line can always be redrawn 
later. If one applied the same reasoning to the 10‐year chart (Figure 2.4), 
the uptrend line would not be confirmed until the rally in late December 
exceeded the November high. Because the December touch points at 1 and 
2 hold along the line, I would not hesitate to draw it.

If  LVLT  (Figure  2.5)  had  immediately  rallied  above  58.95  after  
December 1, the trend line shown here would no longer depict the angle 
of advance. A new line drawn from point 1 would not capture the angle of 
advance. This also occurs after lengthy periods of lateral movement within a 
larger uptrend. The monthly chart (Figure 2.6) of the Dow from the March 
2003 low provides a good example. Here, we have an uptrend line drawn 
across the 2003 and 2004 lows. But the correction from the March 2005 
high penetrates this line, and six months of lateral movement follow. When 
the trend resumes, we could redraw the trend line off the 2003 and October 
2005 lows, but it would be too shallow. A better choice involves drawing a 
second parallel line and anchoring it off the 2005 low. This maintains the 
original angle of advance, but it did not do a good job of pinpointing the 
October 2007 high.

reference to parallel lines brings us to the subject of trend channels. In an 
up‐channel, the demand line is drawn across lows and a parallel supply line

is drawn across an intervening high. Figure 2.7 describes the anchor points

You  can  quickly  see  this  pattern  by  drawing  a  line  across  the  high  of 
point “b” on the LVLT chart (Figure 2.5). The ideal up‐channel will have 
several additional touch points. It should capture most of the price work 
within its boundaries. A rally above the top of an up‐channel is often a bet-
ter  overbought  indication  than  most  mathematical  tools.  A  more  inter-
esting set of channels appears on the daily chart of April 2006 live cattle  
(Figure 2.8). Here we have low points at 1 and 2 in the early stages of the 
advance. The parallel is not drawn across an intervening high. Instead, it is 
drawn across the early October high at 90 cents. If the line had been drawn 
across the intervening high in late September, the supply line would have 
passed through almost all of the price work. We have to be free and creative 
with  the  placement  of  our  lines. At  the  same  time,  we  cannot  force  the 
placement. You can readily see the trading range at the top of the chart. It 
consists of a false breakout above the high and a wide‐open break that pen-
etrated the bottom of the range. These were some of the clues that prices 
were turning down. I cannot omit the steep down‐channel to the April 2006 
low. You  see  the  three  anchor  points  and  the  anemic  rally  in  mid‐March. 
Notice how prices made upward progress above the minor supply line dur-
ing this small lateral movement. In April, prices plunged to the demand line 
and reversed upward. This is the largest rally within the down‐move. I hope 
you see the license taken with the anchor points used in this down‐channel. 
Perhaps in real time I would have begun differently, but once the contract 
broke below 90 cents, the best channel would have become apparent.

Something  else  has  to  be  mentioned  regarding  up‐channels.  Bob  
Evans,  one  of  the  most  prominent  and  enthusiastic  teachers  of  the  
Wyckoff  course,  used  to  prepare  cassette  tapes  on  which  he  discussed  
aspects of chart reading. He devised colorful metaphors for describing dif-
ferent kinds of market behavior. In one of his most famous tapes, he shared 
with his listeners a learning tool devised by a former student. It was called 
“The Shell Diver’s Tragedy” and dealt with the behavior after the break-
down below the demand line of an up‐channel. He compared the market’s 
rise within the channel to a diver who picks shells off the ocean floor and 
returns to the surface (i.e., supply line) where he places them in a floating 
basket. At some point during this activity, he falls below his usual depth 
(demand line) and develops a cramp. He tries valiantly to reach the surface 
but falls short and rolls over for the final time. On the cattle chart, point 
1 marks the final attempt to reach the top of the up‐channel. From this 
tale, we learn to watch the character of the rally following the break of 
the demand line. If prices recover and surge to new highs, the odds favor 
a resumption of the uptrend.

On the monthly chart of the Commodity research Bureau (CrB) In-
dex  (Figure  2.9),  we  see  the “noninflationary”  rise  from  the  2001  low. 
This steep advance fits beautifully within the up‐channel originally drawn 
from points 1, 2, and 3. Notice the numerous touch points at later dates. 

c02.indd   19

After  the  low  in  January  2005,  when  energy  prices  began  to  rise  ex-
ponentially,  the  advance  steepened  and  prices  trended  along  the  sup-
ply line. A second parallel line is drawn from the high at point 4 and it 
stops the next two up‐moves. As illustrated on the monthly Dow chart  
(Figure  2.6),  a  second  parallel  line  broadens  a  channel  and  provides  a 
useful guide for viewing price movement. In the case of the CrB Index, 
the lines do not indicate the uptrend has ended. It steepened and contin-
ued for several more years.

One more type of line deserves attention. It is the reverse trend line 
and  reverse  trend  channel. The  basic  look  is  sketched  in  Figure  2.10. 
They  are  normally  drawn  with  dashed  lines  to  set  them  apart  from 
normal  trend  lines/channels.  Some  uptrends  will  not  fit  in  the  nor-
mal channels we have previously discussed. Because of their steepness, 
they require drawing a reverse trend line across rising highs—points 1 
and 2. To make a reverse up‐channel, a parallel line is drawn across an 
intervening low. In the diagram (Figure 2.10), price does not interact 
with the lower line of the up‐channel; however, in the future, it could 
provide support. Many times, a normal uptrend line will combine nicely 
with  a  reverse  trend  line  to  form  converging  lines.  Some  technicians 

c02.indd   20

3/21/2013   3:04:30 PM

 
refer to this as a rising wedge. In the instance of an uptrend, the con-
verging lines often indicate a rally is tiring or losing momentum. When 
prices are falling within a pattern of converging lines, it usually signifies 
the decline is nearing a low.

Figure 2.11 presents an unnamed chart with the three types of reverse 
trend lines/channels mentioned above. The decline on the left side of the 
chart  fits  into  a  reverse  down‐channel  (AA).  It  is  drawn  by  connecting 
the  two  lows,  and  then  the  parallel  is  attached  to  the  intervening  high. 
The reverse up‐channel CC’ is much steeper and price moves above line 
C.  Notice  the  sell‐off  from  this  high  found  support  on  parallel  line  C’. 
A move above or below a reverse trend line often will mark the end of a 
swing. I know an ingenious trader who has developed software showing 
how many stocks per day have reached or exceeded reverse trend lines. 
In an uptrend, a large increase in the number of these often indicates the 
market is vulnerable to a downturn. Lines BB’ do not form a reverse chan-
nel. Line B is a reverse trend line that, when combined with normal trend 
line B’, forms the converging or wedge pattern. I have never considered 
chart patterns of any significance except for this one, as it is most associ-
ated with ending action.

I cannot stress enough how often a move above or below a reverse trend 
line/channel will lead to a trend reversal. The Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 
daily continuation chart (Figure 2.12) shows the price movement after the 

c02.indd   21

August 2011 low. The volatile trading range AB was resolved by a thrust 
to new lows and an upward reversal. Notice this reversal occurred after 
the break below the reverse trend line within the declining wedge. Circles 
are drawn around the overshoot at the October 4 low and the October 
27 high. The latter was above the reverse trend channel and resulted in

a 142‐point sell‐off. Line B served as both resistance and support during 
the months shown here. This line was the launch pad for a large up‐move 
from the December low.

The live cattle quarterly chart (Figure 2.13) shows a reverse trend chan-
nel spanning many years. Looking backward from the 2011 high, one can 
detect the reverse trend line (A) drawn across the 1993–2003 highs. The 
vertical price rise in 2011 pushed prices above this line. The parallel (A’) 
to this reverse trend line is drawn across the 1996 low. In this situation, the 
line passes through some of the price movement, but it was a parallel rather 
than a starting line. You see how frequently the market respected the parallel 
line. Yet it could not have been drawn until after the 2003 high. A normal 
up‐channel is drawn across the 2002–2009 lows (B) with a parallel across 
the 2003 high (B’). Price rallied to the very top of this channel where we 
have a confluence of lines. Together, they underscore the magnitude of the 
potential extremity.

The stock market reached a major high in October 2007, and most is-
sues  declined  accordingly.  One  exception  was  U.S.  Steel  (Figure  2.14), 
which consolidated throughout 2007. It erupted in April 2008 and gained 
almost $70 per share in the next two months. The up‐move exceeded the 

c02.indd   23

3/21/2013   3:04:30 PM

 
confines of any normal up‐channel. After the stock rallied above the reverse 
trend line in June 2008, the bullish trend finally came to an end and prices  
collapsed. As you can see, exceeding up and down reverse trend lines must 
put one on alert for a trend reversal. No other trend line break has such 
predictive value.

Some price trends defy channels. Their advance or decline is too steep 
to fit into a normal or broadened channel. The uptrend on the weekly July 
2006 sugar chart (Figure 2.15) between May 2005 and February 2006 typi-
fies the problem. Take a look at the five points labeled on the weekly chart. 
The only lines I can conceive begin with points 3 and 5. A parallel line across 
point 4 fails to hold as prices soar beyond its boundary. If one draws a second 
parallel line across point 2, the broadened channel does contain most of the 
price movement until the final high. This may not be a totally “legal” way to 
draw a channel because the high of the second parallel occurred prior to 
points 3 and 5. But it works. Drawing support/resistance lines, trend lines, 
and channels (normal, reverse, or broadened) demands open‐mindedness. 
One must always consider other possibilities. Enough mechanics; now we 
are ready for the story of the lines.

The Story of  
the Lines

27

I cannot stress enough the importance of drawing lines all over your charts. 

They  tell  a  story  and  make  the  price/volume  behavior  stand  out. They 
define  the  angle  of  advance  or  decline  within  a  price  trend,  alert  one  to 
when a market has reached an overbought or oversold point within a trend, 
frame trading ranges, depict prices coiling to a point of equilibrium (apex), 
and help forecast where to expect support or resistance on corrections. We 
will begin with a study of soybean oil. Figure 3.1 shows the price movement 
on the daily continuation chart of soybean oil between December 2001 and 
May 6, 2002. Let’s assume today is May 6 and we are beginning to exam-
ine the behavior on this chart. I first begin with the support and resistance 
lines. Support line A is drawn across the January 28 low. Resistance line B is  
drawn across the February 5 high and resistance line C across the March 15 
high. By extending these horizontal lines across the chart, we see how later  
corrections  in  March  and  May  found  support  along  line  B. When  a  line  
alternately serves as support and resistance, I refer to it as an axis line. Prices 
tend to revolve around these axis lines. In their monumental work, Technical 
Analysis of Stock Trends, Edwards and Magee provided one of the most exten-
sive discussions of support and resistance lines. While they never mentioned 
axis lines in the context described above, they duly noted the phenomenon 
of horizontal lines alternating as both support and resistance:

But  here  is  the  interesting  and  the  important  fact  which,  curiously 
enough,  many  casual  chart  observers  appear  never  to  grasp:  these 

c03.indd   27

3/21/2013   3:05:13 PM

critical price levels constantly switch their roles from support to resis-
tance and from resistance to support. A former top, once it has been 
surpassed, becomes a bottom zone in a subsequent down trend; and 
an old bottom, once it has been penetrated, becomes a top in a later 
advancing phase.1

The support/resistance lines also frame the two trading ranges on this 
portion of the chart. By drawing the lines, we can better observe the at-
tempts of either side to break out, as took place during the trench warfare 
of WWI. The numerous false breakouts on either side of a trading range are 
important tests of the opposing forces’ strength. As will be discussed later, 
many low‐risk trading opportunities are provided by these tests.

only one important trend line can be drawn at this stage of the mar-
ket’s development. In Figure 3.2, trend line T is drawn across the January–
February lows. notice how prices interacted with this line in early May. 
Parallel line T’ is drawn across the March high. This is a normal up‐channel 
where a support line (or demand line) is drawn across two lows and a par-
allel resistance line (or supply line) is drawn across an intervening high.

In this case, the intervening high would be in late February. Given the sub-
sequent price movement, a line across the actual intervening high would 
be meaningless. Therefore, it is drawn across a higher point on the chart. 
The angle of advance depicted by up‐channel TT’ is not steep and will not 
contain a larger rally. Two minor up‐channels are shown within TT’. The 
first of these, from late February to March 15, is a normal channel. The 
slower price rise from the March low to the April high is also framed by a 
normal up‐channel.

notice how the market rose above the top of this up‐channel in April and 
also above resistance line C without following through. The rise above the 
supply line of the channel created an overbought condition that is more reli-
able than those provided by mathematical indicators. Without getting too 
far ahead of ourselves, the position of the close on the top day indicated the 
market had met supply (selling). The downswing from the April high is too 
steep for drawing channels so a simple downtrend line is drawn. At certain 
points in the struggle between buyers and sellers, prices often arrive at a 
nexus or confluence of lines. Many times, these areas produce important 
turning points. At the April high, we see the supply line of a minor up‐chan-
nel meeting resistance line C. At the May low, we have trend line T, resis-
tance line B, and a minor downtrend line coming together. When there is 

c03.indd   29

3/21/2013   3:05:13 PM

 
 
 
 
 
such a confluence of lines, one should be alert to the possibility of a turning 
point. I rarely establish a trade based on the evidence of trend lines alone. As 
will be discussed later, other factors are taken into account; however, if one 
wanted to make trades based on only one type of technical phenomenon, 
the lines would serve as an excellent guide.

Figure 3.3 shows the price movement through the second week of July 
2002. We immediately see that the advance from the May low started with 
a fast, four‐day rise and then slowed into an orderly stair‐step affair. Several 
channels could have been drawn off different turning points from the May 
low, but by May 30 (five days from the high) channel  VV’ provided the best 
fit. This rally far exceeded the top of channel TT’. From the June 6 high, a 
new trading range formed. notice how the lower boundary of this range 
approached former resistance line C. After the market rallied above May 
high, l would have drawn the channel labeled XX’. It is drawn by connect-
ing  the  May–July  lows  and  placing  a  parallel  line  across  the  intervening 
high in June.

Before  we  leave  the  study  of  this  market,  one  last  picture  is  provided 
in Figure 3.4. here, we see how the rally from the July low moved slight-
ly above channel XX’ creating an overbought condition. Resistance line E 
is drawn across the July high. From this high, the market declines until it 
finds support along line D. After prices surge again, trend line y is drawn. 
It and line X’ form a rising wedge. While I am not interested in looking for

 geometric patterns, the converging lines clearly show the shortening of the 
upward thrust. notice how prices keep pushing through the supply line of 
channel XX’ but fail to start a steeper angle of advance. After the sell‐off 
from the last high above the channel, I drew resistance line F. The sell‐off 
found support around line y, and the market actually made a fractional new 
high above line F before reversing downward. At this juncture, notice the 
confluence of lines: resistance line F, supply line X’, and support line y all 
converge at this point. Support line G is drawn across the low between the 
final two highs, and it plays an important role over the next few weeks.

So far we have dealt only with the lines on the chart as the price move-
ment unfolded. In Figure 3.5, eight of the most important points on the 
soybean oil chart are numbered for discussion. At these points, we discern 
ending  action  or  clues  about  impending  ending  action.  Point  1  is  a  false 
breakout above line C. here, the market rallied above resistance but closed 
below the line and near the day’s low. Two days later, the narrow range indi-
cated demand was tired and price would pull back. The ensuing sell‐off held 
on top of line B. notice the narrowing of the price range on the low day 
of the sell‐off. here, the sellers seemingly had the upper hand. At point 2, 
however, prices reversed upward, closing above the previous day’s high and 
putting the market in a strong position. This reversal propelled prices higher 
until the rally tired in early June. note the narrow range and weak close at

the June high. After a pullback and consolidation, the market returned to the 
upper end of the new trading range. It marked time for three days in a tight 
range before accelerating upward over the next two sessions. Point 3 refers 
to the absorption within the tight range prior to the breakout. At point 4, 
price rallies above the up‐channel from the May low and the position of the 
close indicated selling was present. The pullback to point 5 tested the area 
where prices rose vertically. The position of the close at point 5 reflected the 
presence of buying. At points 6 and 7, we see how prices are struggling to 
continue higher. A reverse trend line (dashed) could have been drawn across 
the high of points 4 and 6 to highlight the market’s lack of upward progress. 
The fractional new high at point 8 along with the weak close indicates that 
demand is exhausted. The cumulative behavior between points 4 and 8 (with 
the exception of point 5) indicates the uptrend in soybean oil is tiring and 
increases the likelihood of a correction. The high‐volume break (see arrow) 
below support line G indicates the force of the selling had overcome the 
force of the buying. The buyers attempted to recover the ground lost below 
support line G; however, the rallies ended with weak closes as the sellers 
thwarted both efforts. All of these points will be discussed in later chapters.

The kind of lines we have drawn on the daily soybean oil charts can be 
applied to longer‐term charts as well. They help focus one’s attention on 
the  larger  battle  lines,  which,  in  some  cases,  have  provided  support  and 
resistance for years or decades. An awareness of a market’s position within 
its historical framework fits the needs of the stock investor as well as those 

c03.indd   32

3/21/2013   3:05:14 PM

 
 
 
 
 
of  a  position  trader  or  commercial  operating  in  the  futures  markets. The 
long‐term support/resistance lines, trend lines, and channels in conjunction 
with the range of the price bars (weekly, monthly, yearly) and the position 
of their closes can be interpreted in the same manner, as illustrated in the 
preceding discussion. With the study of the long‐term charts, time marks 
the  only  difference.  Price  movement  on  an  hourly  or  daily  chart  can  be 
interpreted much more quickly than with monthly or yearly charts. yet the 
biggest rewards come from recognizing when long‐term opportunities are 
developing. From this information, we can then zero in on the daily chart.

Soybean oil in 2002 was such an opportunity. Figure 3.6 shows yearly 
cash soybean oil prices from 1931 to 2003. It tells the story of many com-
modities over the past 75 years:

 ■ Prices bottomed in the early 1930s at the depth of the Depression.

 ■ Prices  rose  into  the  high  of  the  late  1940s  under  the  stimulus  of  the  

Marshall Plan.

 ■ Prices entered a period of extreme dullness until awakening in the late 

1960s.

 ■ Prices rose sharply during the mid‐1970s under inflationary pressure.

 ■ Prices  entered  extremely  volatile  trading  range  until  bottoming  in  the 

1999–2002 period.

This has been the general price pattern of many agricultural commodities 
produced in the United States. horizontal resistance lines are drawn across 
the 1935, 1947, and 1956 highs. Look at the market’s interaction with these 
lines. Between 1952 and 1972 soybean oil stabilized on top of the 1935 high. 
The 1956 high was blown away by the meteoric rise in 1973, thanks in part 
to export demand. This explosive rally carried through the 1947 peak, but 
the gains were short lived as prices promptly reversed back to the area of 
the 1956 high. A new trading range developed roughly on top of this previ-
ous resistance level. After 1985, prices coiled for 13 years into an apex. The 
breakdown from 1998 to 2000 was a terminal shakeout of the larger trading 
range from the 1975 low. In 2001, shortly before our study of the daily chart 
began, prices reversed above the 2000 high and closed near midrange. This 
put soybean oil on the springboard for a much larger up‐move. An under-
standing of the market’s position on the long‐term chart at the beginning of 
2002 gave greater meaning to the turning points in May and July. By early 
2004, prices had rallied into the 34‐cent area. Prices doubled again on the 
rise to the 2008 high (71 cents).

In Figure 3.7, we see the history of cash cocoa prices back to 1930. The 
major turning points in cocoa line up with those in soybean oil: low in early 
1930s, top in 1947, long trading range to the low of the 1960s, huge up‐
wave during the 1970s, and a bottom at the end of the twentieth century. 
In 1977, cocoa peaked at a price 74 times greater than its 1933 low. The

price range in 1977 equals the distance from 1933 to 1973. only a semilog 
scale would allow one to see the earlier price history. The up‐channel drawn 
across the 1940–1965 lows has contained almost all of the price work. In 
1977, however, prices exceeded the channel. In the following year, all the 
gains of 1977 were erased. The 24‐year downtrend from the 1977 high pro-
gressed in an orderly fashion. Each support level provided resistance in later 
years, and they should be expected to play an important role in the future. 
I thought cocoa had bottomed in 1992. here, the downward thrust short-
ened, prices had returned to the top of the 1947 resistance line, and they 
were testing the vertical, liftoff area of 1973. Although prices had almost 
doubled by 1998, the up‐move was too laborious. notice the lack of upward 
follow‐through after the minor breakout in 1997. In 1999, cocoa experi-
enced an unrelenting down‐move that ended with a close near the 1992 low.
A distinct change in behavior occurred in 2000. here, we see little down-
ward progress but no willingness to rally. Prices narrowed into the tight-
est  yearly  range  since  1971.  (Remember,  the  semilog  scale  draws  larger 
price bars whenever prices decline. Thus, a cursory examination of the chart 
might lead one to believe the ranges in 1987 and 1996 were smaller than in 
2000; however, this is not true.) In light of our discussion of narrow ranges, 
the behavior in 2000 deserves special attention. The market simply treaded 
water just below the 1992 low and the long‐term uptrend line. The breaking 
of a trend line is not of major consequence by itself. What matters is how 
the trend line is broken and the amount of follow‐through. As you see, there 
is no ease of downward movement. If the sellers still had the upper hand, 
prices should have continued lower. In the following year, when prices re-
versed above the 2000 high, the change of trend became obvious. After the 
rise above the 2000 high, one could have purchased cocoa with impunity. 
over the next two years, cocoa prices rose over 200 percent. The behavior 
during  1992–2001  is  typical  of  bottoms  on  charts  constructed  from  any 
time period.

on the yearly cocoa and soybean oil charts, the price action around the 
major support/resistance lines told the main story. on the monthly bond 
chart (Figure 3.8), the story is different. here, we see a reverse trend chan-
nel  (dashed  lines)  that  most  aptly  depicted  the  angle  of  advance  in  bond 
futures. It was drawn across the 1986–1993 highs with a parallel line across 
the 1987 low. A second parallel line was drawn across the 1990 low, and 
it  provided  support  in  1994  and  January  2000.  Since  it  was  first  drawn, 
the lower parallel line has never interacted with price. The rallies in 1998 
and 2003 penetrated the upper line of the reverse trend channel,  creating

a   temporarily  overbought  condition.  A  reverse  trend  line  and/or  trend 
channel often fits best on those trends with the steepest angle of advance/
decline. A normal trend channel drawn from the 1981 or 1984 lows would 
never have contained the subsequent price work. After prices rallied from 
the  1994  low,  however,  a  normal  trend  channel  could  have  been  drawn 
across the 1987–1994 lows with a parallel line across the 1993 high. It fits 
nicely with the reverse trend channel. I prefer the reverse trend channel be-
cause it depicts the original angle of advance; its message was reinforced by 
the normal channel. The confluence of three upper‐channel lines at the 2003 
top warned that the bond market was grossly overbought. These three lines 
played an important role throughout the course of the uptrend.

The  dramatic  sell‐off  in  1987,  coinciding  with  the  stock  market  crash, 
found support on top of the 1982–1983 highs. Prices later consolidated on 
top of the resistance line drawn across the 1986 high. one can easily visualize 
the three‐year apex that came to a conclusion in 1997. The uppermost resis-
tance line drawn across the 1998 high (caused by the debacle in Long Term 
Capital Management) halted the rally in 2001. The nine months of pumping 
action between August 2002 and April 2003 marked the beginning of a five‐
year trading range. In December 2008, as the stock market went into a tail-
spin, bonds soared to 143, an unheard‐of price until 2012. Bonds then traded 
in a volatile, 26‐point range until the breakout in September 2011 reached 
147. This high touched the same reverse trend lines as at the 2003 top.

In the modern‐day Wyckoff course, the line of support across the bottom of 
a trading range is compared to the ice covering a frozen pond. It is called the 
ice line. Wyckoff never used this term, but it provides a memorable metaphor. 
The 1977–2000 downtrend on the cocoa yearly chart (Figure 3.7) demonstrates 
price repeatedly interacting with previous support or ice lines. A much smaller 
example appears in Figure 3.4 of soybean oil. Support line G drawn between 
the two highs served as a minor ice line. There were numerous attempts to rally 
upward from below line G, but no sustained advance developed.

one of the best examples of price interacting with an ice line occurred 
after the QQQ (Figure 3.9) made its all‐time high. The QQQ experienced 
a  sharp,  high‐volume  break  in  January  2000  but  then  managed  to  make 
a series of new highs. After  the February  liftoff,  the  QQQ  spent  10  days 
consolidating  on  top  of  the  January  trading  range.  It  pushed  off  this  for-
mer resistance level and climbed to the top of the up‐channel on March 10 
(point 1) where the daily range narrowed and the stock closed near the day’s 
low. It looked tired and fell back to the March 16 low. Previously, on the 
15th (point 2), the stock broke on the heaviest down‐volume in its history. 
Volume  failed  to  expand  on  the  subsequent  rally  to  the  March  24  (point 
3)  top  where  we  see  the  overbought  position  within  the  up‐channel,  the 
midrange close and the diminished upward progress (beyond the March 10 
high). The buyers make a feeble attempt to lift prices on the following day 
(narrow range, low volume, and weak close) and the stock falls for three 
consecutive sessions toward the bottom of the current trading range. on 
April 3 (point 4), the QQQ falls with widening price spread and increased 
volume through the ice line drawn across the March 16 low and below the 
January high. The size of the daily range and volume set new records yet the 
buyers, who had become conditioned to take advantage of weakness, rushed 
in to drive prices toward the day’s high and above the ice line. Despite the 
intraday recovery, the 32‐point break from the March 24 high marked an 
overtly bearish change in behavior. It was followed by a low‐volume rally 
that retraced less than 50 percent of the previous decline. The downward 
reversal on April 10 (point 5) ended the rally above the ice line, and prices 
dropped 29 points in five days. notice how prices stabilized in April around 
the support line drawn across the January low. By then, however, 35 percent 
of the stock’s value had been lost in 16 days. The speed and magnitude of its 
fall heralded the beginning of a major trend change. Although the peak was 
complete, the interaction with the ice line continued for six more months.
The lines shown in Figure 3.9 tell a larger story when extended across 
the weekly QQQ chart (Figure 3.10). here, we see the stock struggle for

six weeks during April and May to rally off the January support line. The 
sellers temporarily overcome the buyers and drive the stock below this sup-
port, but the lack of follow‐through produces a big reversal. It leads to a test 
of the original ice line. After a second pullback, in late July, the stock makes 
another run at the ice line. The close for the week ending September 1, 2000,

holds above the ice; however, the lack of follow‐through plus the downward 
reversal  in  the  following  week  underscore  the  sellers’  dominance.  Prices 
 return to the bottom of the trading range (circled area) where the buyers 
and sellers lock into a five‐week slugfest. It marked the buyers’ last hope. 
The buying came from shorts liquidating positions established around the 
April–May lows, profit taking by traders who sold short in early Septem-
ber,  and  bottom  picking  by  new  longs. The  sellers  absorbed  the  buying, 
the topping process ended, and the downtrend began in earnest. While the 
March low has been labeled an ice line, the same metaphor can be applied 
to the line drawn across the January low. In fact, support lines drawn across 
the bottom of any trading range—on a yearly or an hourly chart—can be 
viewed in this light. over the long‐term, we should expect the January 2000 
ice line to play a significant role in all of the nasdaq indices. In fact, the rise 
from the 2009 low stopped against this line in 2012.

Throughout this book, we will see many more examples of price interacting 
with various types of lines and channels. But one more interaction needs to be 
described. The man who introduced the Wyckoff course to me always stressed 
the importance of apexes. he did not view apexes as so‐called “continuation pat-
terns.” In fact, he did not concern himself with pattern recognition at all. Instead, 
he looked for price tightening and especially at or near the point of two con-
verging trend lines. By itself, an apex has little or no predictive value. It simply 
indicates the amplitude of price swings has narrowed to a point of equilibrium 
between the forces of supply and demand. This equilibrium cannot continue in-
definitely; it will be shattered. one looks for price/volume clues that indicate 
the future direction. often, the evidence conflicts until some unusual volume 
surge or reversal action tips the scale in favor of one side. Wyckoff described 
behavior that foretells market direction out of dullness. he wrote:

When a dull market shows its inability to hold rallies, or when it does not 
respond to bullish news, it is technically weak. . . . on the other hand, 
when there is a gradual hardening in prices; when bear raids fail to dislodge 
considerable quantities of stock; when stocks do not decline upon unfavor-
able news, we may look for an advancing market in the near future.2

Apexes on long‐term charts (monthly, yearly) can be especially frustrat-
ing, but they offer the greatest reward. Between the late 1960s and 1980, 
my friend/mentor sought out these kinds of situations. Prior to changes in

the tax code regarding futures trading, he earned long‐term capital gains 
by holding contracts for six months or more. This required purchasing de-
ferred contracts and holding on with great tenacity. often, the positions 
had to be rolled several times before the expected price move occurred. 
Like Wyckoff,  he  based  much  of  his  long‐term  forecasts  on  a  battery  of 
point–figure charts.

one  of  the  most  memorable  and  drawn‐out  apexes  occurred  in  silver 
futures (Figure 3.11) between 1974 and 1977. Because of the bullish trend 
of commodities, few traders doubted that silver would ultimately move up-
ward out of its trading range, but no one knew which up‐move was the “real” 
one. With such a consensus of bullish expectations, it was the market’s job 
to wear out as many longs as possible. Each upswing attracted a new herd 
of speculators who were promptly run out on the subsequent downswing. 
yet clues emerged—mostly on the daily bar chart—that the buyers were 
steadily overcoming the sellers. on the monthly chart, unusual volume ap-
peared in november–December 1976. Prices did not fall below the lows 
of this period until many years later. In 1977, silver found support in June. 
Although  this  low  was  washed  out  in August,  prices  ended  the  month  in 
midrange. Volume in August 1977 was the lowest in over a year; it said the 
selling pressure was exhausted. Prices rose gently for two months and nar-
rowed during november–December into the point of the apex.

The  “breakout”  from  this  apex  occurred  in  the  most  lackluster  man-

movement. Like a heavily laden truck, it lumbered out of the garage. The 
up‐move in March 1978 saw widening price spread as prices exceeded the 
1975  high,  but  there  was  no  vertical  liftoff.  Compare  the  price  action  in  
January–February 1974 with the price rise during 1978. The vertical price 
rise in the first two months of 1974 reflects panic buying, a speculative blow‐
off—what Wyckoff referred to as hypodermics. no fanfare, no excitement ac-
companied the price rise in 1978. It produced doubt rather than eagerness 
to buy. Prices inched higher, testing and retesting every support/resistance 
level  as  the  buyers  gradually  overcame  the  persistent  selling. The  quanti-
ties of silver offered at each resistance level were steadily absorbed as the 
ownership of the metal moved from weak hands to strong hands. The slow 
price movement in silver resembled, in many ways, the action one sees on a 
one‐minute or five‐minute bar chart. Tape readers have long recognized the 
significance of slow rallies as opposed to effervescent bubbles where prices 
levitate upward. Think of Wyckoff’s “gradual hardening of price.” Addressing 
this behavior, humphrey neill wrote, “A more gradual advance with con-
stant volume of transactions, as opposed to spurts and wide price‐changes, 
indicates  a  better  quality  of  buying.”3  I  should  add  that  gradual  advances 
attract short sellers, who perceive the slow pace to be a sign of weak de-
mand, and who, when forced to cover, provide the fodder for additional price 
gains. In summation, the breakout from the four‐year apex on the monthly 
silver chart did not begin with a loud thunderclap announcing the start of 
a new uptrend. Instead, it began as a crawl and eventually steamrolled into 
one of the biggest bull markets in the history of the futures markets.

We  have  just  examined  the  classic  apex  unfolding  over  several  years. 
Smaller apexes abound. They are drawn with a simple triangulation of trend 
lines to show prices at a nexus. Sometimes the triangulation is meaningful, 
other times not. But it helps to highlight a point of contraction such as the 
two on Figure 3.12 of Schlumberger (SLB).

The first apex (point 1) formed over a few days during September 1998 
and requires no larger context; it stands alone. The larger apex (point 2) 
spanned four months, and we better understand its significance when we see 
its position on the weekly chart (Figure 3.13). Does the price/volume be-
havior within this apex portend further weakness or the beginning of a new 
uptrend? The total volume for the week ending December 4, 1998, is the 
largest on the chart; it is climactic. on the daily chart, we see the huge effort

to drive prices below the trading range. yet there was little follow‐through, 
and the stock quickly bobbed back into the trading range. All of the selling 
that emerged during the week of December 4 was erased on the ensuing 
rebound. on the weekly chart, a selling climax occurred in early December.
In  the  context  of  the  daily  chart,  where  we  observe  the  details  of  the 
trading  range  from  the  September  1998  low,  the  high‐volume  plunge  in 
December led to an upward reversal. It produced a rally to the top of the 
trading range. The lower volume on the pullback to the January low was a 
secondary test of the low. As prices lifted off the January low, one might have 
recognized that prices were narrowing into an apex. Lines would have been 
drawn across the november–January highs and the December–January lows 
to frame the price movement. The quick rise in early January and again in 
early February reflects the buyers’ eagerness. Then the stock pulls back to 
the uptrend line and comes to rest above the January low.

In the last 8 weeks shown in Figure 3.14, prices tighten into a 2.25‐point 
range.  It  says  something  is  about  to  happen  soon. The  stock  may  start  to 
lift out of the apex and reverse downward, or it may break downward and 
then reverse upward. If we buy the breakout or sell the breakdown, our risk 
 increases and we make ourselves vulnerable to a whipsaw. The selling climax

in  early  December,  the  reversal  from  the  December  low,  and  the  stock’s 
ability to make higher supports all paint a bullish story. now let’s read the 
message of the last eight price bars.

on  days  1  through  4,  prices  close  lower  and  near  their  lows. Volume 
increases on days 3 and 4. note that the closes on days 3 through 5 are clus-
tered within a 44‐cent range, indicating little reward despite the large sell-
ing effort. The rally on day 5 erases most of the previous four days’ losses, 
and the big increase in volume indicates the presence of demand. over the 
next three days, prices narrow within the range of day 5, and volume dwin-
dles. The closes on days 5 through 7 are bunched within a 31‐cent range as 
the stock comes to dead center. The chart says go long on day 8 and protect 
below the low of day 4. SLB opens at 25 on March 3, kicking off a rally to 
44. Price/volume behavior at the point of an apex is not always so perfect. 
Many times, one has to deal with a more ambiguous situation. In those in-
stances, the behavior preceding the point of the apex usually determines the 
outcome.

As already mentioned, price tightness is the hallmark of an apex. When it 
occurs on yearly charts, the effect can be most dramatic. one of the greatest 
examples of this occurred on the yearly sugar chart (Figure 3.15), where cash 
prices coiled for four years within the year 2000 range. At the time, I thought 
nearby futures prices would rebound to 16 cents, the high made in the 1990s. 
As it turned out, cash and futures rose above 35 cents a few years later.

now we turn to an incomplete apex on Figure 3.16, the weekly chart of 
home Depot. As shown, when I approach a chart for the first time, I dissect 
it by drawing the appropriate lines and highlighting those features that stand 
out the most. here, we see prices rallied in late 1999 above an up‐channel 
drawn from the 1998 low, and we make the following observations:

  1.  The vertical price rise during the first two weeks of December 1999 
where the volume in the second week is the heaviest since the 1998 low.
  2.  The sell‐off in the first week of January 2000 is the largest down week in 
years and is accompanied by the heaviest down‐volume since the 1998 low.
  3.  The great ease of upward movement on the mid‐March rally where the 
position of the closes in the circled area warn of impending trouble.
  4.  The tiny upthrust and huge downward reversal during the second week 

of April.

  5.  Support forms in May on top of the April–July 1999 resistance line.
  6.  The small upthrust of the July 2000 high is followed by a downward 
reversal on the largest daily volume during the second week of August.

Together, these elements tell a bearish story. over the next few weeks, 
prices tighten into an apex between the downtrend line from the high and 
the uptrend line from the May 2000 low.

The details of the apex are on the home Depot daily chart (Figure 3.17). 
here, we see a narrow trading range spanning 16 days. It has formed within 
the wide range (point 6) on the weekly chart. on day 9, prices break below

the bottom of the range, but no follow‐through selling emerges. This low is 
tested on day 13, where the stock closes on the low. once again, the sell-
ers fail to take advantage of bearish price action. The stock rallies on day 15 
above the trading range but slips a bit on the close. no more buying power 
exists as the stock breaks on the last day and closes below the bar 15 low. The 
down‐volume on the last day is the largest since the August low. now we have 
a sequence of behavior to act upon. no one knows for certain if the trad-
ing range will continue and prices coil further into the apex. But the minor 
upthrust in the context of an oppressively bearish weekly chart increases the 
likelihood of a breakdown. Shorts are established on the close or the opening 
of the following day and stops placed above the high of day 15. on the next 
day, the stock fell to 51.12. Four days later it hit 35, where the enormous 
volume signaled climactic action. I realize that some of the twists and turns 
within the small trading range appeared bullish at times. But the stalling of 
the market in the area where supply last overcame demand (point 6) was the 
overriding consideration. It should have kept one fixed on the idea of looking 
for a shorting opportunity rather than making a quick long trade.

In the study of Schlumberger and home Depot, I am leading the reader 
beyond the mere story of the lines. I have integrated the story of the lines 
with the bar‐by‐bar chart reading that incorporates a comparison of price 
range, position of the close, and volume. There’s much more ahead.

The Logic of 
Reading Bar 
Charts

47

When  studying  a  bar  chart,  we  go  through  a  process  of  sequential 

evaluation. This normally consists of comparing the immediate price 
movement with the most recent price bars. From this comparison, we make 
deductions or inferences about what to expect in the next time period. Of 
course, we are always faced with the realization that anything can happen. 
The  market  we  are  watching  can  gap  sharply  higher  or  lower  because  of 
unexpected news events. These are the extremes of the probability curve, 
but they must be accepted as part of the territory by anyone who ventures 
into  speculation.. The  exercise  below  is  purely  abstract.  No  contextual 
clues such as trend lines, channels, support/resistance levels, and volume 
are provided. Let’s assume two things: each vertical bar represents one day 
and prices are in a downtrend. The first bar is day “a” and the second is “b.” 
From this minimal information, what do you expect to happen on day “c”? 
I realize there are always two interpretations (the glass is either half full or 
half empty), but what is your best deduction? There may be some instances 
where the situation is too ambiguous. Consider the price range and the posi-
tion of the close. Do not consider these two‐bar sequences as “cookie prints” 
for studying future price movement. We are examining the price behavior of 
two days in order to construct a logical set of expectations for the following 
day. My observations and deductions are included.

Figure  4.1  sequential Chart Reading

Figure 4.1, #1: The size of bar “a” reflects ease of downward movement 
and it describes what is meant by a large bar since the close is in the middle 
of the range, we assume buying emerged at the lower levels of the day. On 
day “b,” the range narrows, thus reflecting no ease of downward movement. 
The low of the day is only slightly below the low of day “a” as the thrust 
shortens. Finally, the close is again midrange, indicating that buyers were 
present at lower levels.

For two consecutive days, prices closed in midrange and the downward 
thrust shortened. The market is displaying an unwillingness to move lower. 
Therefore, expect an attempt to rally on day “c.” If the rally exceeds the top 
of day “b,” and prices then reverse below the low of day “b,” expect further 
weakness.

Figure 4.1, #2: There is ease of downward movement on day “a,” and the 
close at the low of the range reflects a total victory by the sellers. The nar-
row range on day “b” is more difficult to interpret. Does it mean the sellers 
were unable to make much headway? Does it mean the buyers made a stand 
and took all of the sellers’ offers? The position of the close gives us a better 
clue. since the close is on the low of day “b” and below the low of day “a,” we 
infer the sellers are still in control. If the close had been at the high of the 
range, the outcome would have tilted more in favor of the bulls.

given the position of the close on day “b” we tentatively expect further 
weakness on day “c.” If there is little or no downward follow‐through on day 
“c” and prices rally above the high of day “b,” larger gains are likely.

Figure 4.1, #3: Day “a” personifies weakness: ease of downward move-
ment and a close near the low of the range. a small gap lower occurs on day 
“b,” but the range narrows. The close on day “b” is near the low and below the 
previous day’s close and low.

although there was no ease of downward movement on day “b,” all of 
the trading took place below the previous day’s low. There was no ability to 
rally. In addition, the day ended with a close on the low. The sellers remain 
in control so expect lower prices. should price reverse above the close of 
day “a”—especially  after  falling  below  the  low  of  day “b”—a  turnaround 
of some unknown degree would occur. This two‐day configuration is more 
bearish than #1 or #2.

Figure 4.1, #4: The price range is narrower on day “a,” and the close is 
near  the  low  of  the  range. Thus,  the  sellers  were  seemingly  in  control  at 
the end of day “a.” On day “b,” price falls below the previous day’s low and 
reverses to close above the previous day’s high.

The reversal action on day “b” is the classic key reversal. It tells us there was 
no further selling interest below the previous low. The lack of selling pres-
sure created a vacuum and the buyers stepped in. Much of this buying may 
have been short covering. But the strong close above the previous day’s high 
suggests support has at least temporarily formed. One would expect upward 
follow‐through on day “c.” a reversal and close below the low of day “b” would 
be very bearish. The low of day “b” can be used as a stop point on any new long.
Figure 4.1, #5: There is ease of downward movement on day “a” and the 
close is near the low of the range. On day “b,” a rally above the previous day’s 
high fails to hold and prices fall back to close near the low. The closes on the 
two days are just about equal. Would you think the clustering of these two 
closes reflects strong support?

Because the rally on day “b” failed to hold and 99 percent of the gains 
were  erased  on  the  close,  we  would  expect  further  weakness  on  day “c.” 
here, we have two consecutive days of holding action, but the position of 
the closes reflects weakness and an inability to sustain a rally. No, the clus-
tering of these two closes would not normally be viewed as strong support. 
It looks more like temporary support in a downtrend.

Figure 4.1, #6: although there is ease of downward movement on day 
“a,” the position of the close is well off the low and much nearer the high. 
Day “b” is one of those inscrutable, narrow‐range bars where prices barely 
budge from the previous day’s close.

The position of the close on day “a” indicates buying appeared at the lower 
level of the range. It has a bullish connotation. Day “b” shows a total lack of 
movement. In the Wyckoff lexicon, this kind of day is referred to as a “hinge” 
from which a larger swing may occur. In the context of these two days, the 
hinge says prices have come to dead center. It alone does not reveal direc-
tion, but it tells us to be very alert on day “c” for something decisive.

Figure 4.1, #7: as in the preceding example, there is ease of downward 
movement on day “a,” and the close is near the high of the range. Day “b,” 
however, contains a large gap between its high and the close of the previous 
day. The actual range is narrow, and price closes near the low and below the 
previous day’s low.

although the actual range on day “b” is narrow, the true range—encom-
passing the gap—is quite large. here, we see all of the gains made on day “a” 
completely erased. The gap probably stems from bearish overnight events 
or a preopening report. Notice how little movement occurred after the gap 
opening. This reflects a bearish condition as the buyers were unwilling to 
make any attempt to start a move on the upside. Nor were the sellers eager 
to take profits. The selling pressure and lack of buying kept prices depressed 
throughout the session. expect further weakness on day “c.”

Figure 4.1, #8: here we have the reverse of #7. We see ease of down-
ward movement on day “a,” with a weak close near the low of the range. 
On day “b,” price gaps higher and rallies above the high of the previous day; 
however, the close is on the low of the actual range and slightly below the 
high of day “a.”

The  true  range  of  day “b”  begins  from  the  close  of  day “a.”  some  un-
expectedly bullish news caused such a gap higher. The action on day “b” is 
decidedly bullish as it erases all of the previous day’s weakness. except for 
the position of the close, it rates in bullishness next to the key reversal in 
#4. One might be concerned about the “weak” close on day “b.” But it is not 
weak when we consider the true range.

Figure 4.1, #9: Both days “a” and “b” have narrow ranges and close near 
their lows. On day “b,” price opens below the low of the previous day and 
stays below its low throughout the entire session.

We see no ease of downward movement on either day. These two price 
bars reflect a steadily eroding market in which the buyers are backing away. 
The volume is probably low to moderate. No wild, flailing, climactic action 
here. Instead, we have two slow, steady, unobtrusive down days (slip‐sliding 
away) with the few upticks most likely caused by light short covering or a 
few foolhardy bottom pickers. expect further weakness on day “c.”

Figure 4.1, #10: The range of day “a” does not reflect great ease of down-
ward movement and price closes in the middle. On day “b,” price rallies with 
somewhat greater ease but closes well off the high of the day, below the high 
of day “a” and only a fraction higher.

The midrange close on day “a” and the lack of a wide price spread suggest 
buying is present. at the end of day “a,” a rally would have seemed likely.

a robust rally occurs on day “b,” but the position of the close indicates selling 
was encountered. The close of day “b” marks the midpoint of the two days’ 
trading. We can assume trading has been brisk, possibly volatile; however, 
little upward progress is achieved. The sellers still appear in control; there-
fore, expect weakness on day “c.” Depending on where day “c” opens, the 
information here could quickly fit into an equally bullish or bearish story. In 
many ways, #10 represents the most ambiguous situation.

In Figure 4.2, I have arranged the 10, 2‐day sequences discussed above 
into a 20‐day decline. The order remains exactly the same. While this is a 
purely hypothetical situation, created randomly, it has a realistic look with 
a typical mixture of clarity and ambiguity. I have drawn support/resistance 
lines and a normal downtrend channel connecting two highs and an inter-
vening low. Together these lines frame the price movement. They help tell 
the story about where minor trading ranges formed and where the break-
downs  occurred;  they  highlight  the  false  breakouts/breakdowns  and  the 
angle of decline.

When viewed in a larger context, some of the price bars take on a new 
meaning. The price action at the close of bar 1b pointed to a rally. as we see, 
the  resulting  rally  upthrusted  the  top  of  1a.  and  price  reversed  downward 
in a bearish manner. We recognized the bearish connotations for bar 2b and 
here it becomes more apparent as the market hugs its low with no ability to 
rally. The ease of downward movement in 3a shows the sellers have gained the 
upper hand and they remain dominant in 3b and 4a. The key reversal in 4b 
temporarily stops the sell‐off. The price action in 5a and 5b paints a bearish 
picture. In 6a, however, the firm close says the buyers are trying to absorb the 
overhead selling. Price comes to dead center in 6b and we wait for the market 
to show its hand. as usual, it is tricky and volatile. In 7a, the bottom of the 
immediate trading range is penetrated yet price reverses upward. This spring-
like action had bullish potential as long as the low of 7a held. as it turned out, 
some bearish overnight development caused a sharply lower gap opening on 
7b. Once again the implication was very bearish and prices accelerated lower 
on 8a. When we looked at day 8b as part of a two‐day exercise, the recovery 
appeared bullish. On this chart, however, we see 8b as an attempt to move 
above the former support line. The position of the close on 8b warns the effort 
has failed. The narrow ranges in 9a and 9b reflect little ease of movement and 
suggest a secondary test of the recent low. Day 10a, which seemed so ambigu-
ous in abstract form, looks more meaningful here. Price falls below the low of 
the trading range and there is little downward progress. If we could measure 
the amount of ground covered on the down‐moves below 1b, 4b, 8a, and 10a, 
it would be obvious the downward thrust has shortened. The position of the 
close is midrange and above the close of 9b. It says to expect further gains. On 
the final day, 10b, price rallies through the downtrend line; however, it does 
not resolve the situation because the close is near the low of the day’s range. 
But price did manage to exceed the highs of the three previous bars and close 
fractionally higher. If there is little downward pressure on 11a, price will be 
on the springboard for a larger rally.

so far, we have referred to ease of movement, springs, upthrusts, absorp-
tion, and shortening of the thrust. They will be discussed throughout the 
chapters that follow. Volume is the one missing ingredient. In order to incor-
porate the subject of volume into this discussion, I have plotted a hypotheti-
cal volume histogram below the price bars. Because these charts are drawn 
manually, the spacing between each day is not perfectly equidistant. While 
the chart may not have a great deal of graphic precision, the behavior herein 
complements the other elements we have discussed. But first a few words 
about volume, which measures force. We compare the force (or effort) of

the buying and selling against the reward (price gain or loss) to determine 
which side is dominant and to identify signs of an imminent change in trend. 
Volume  interpretation  is  routinely  reduced  to  a  set  of  general  formulas: 
price and volume rising = bullish; price rising and volume falling = bearish; 
price falling and volume rising = bearish, price falling and volume falling = 
bullish. These formulas are too simplistic. They do not capture the nuance of 
price/volume behavior. They only serve as rough guidelines. For example, 
there are occasions when price rises on decreasing volume because fewer 
traders want to bet against a strong uptrend. Conversely, many times prices 
fall on diminished volume because the buyers have backed away or given up. 
Rallies and sell‐offs on very heavy volume can indicate climactic or stopping 
action.  Rallies  and  sell‐offs  on  very  low  volume  often  signify  exhaustion. 
Many trends begin with a burst of volume, which serves as the prime mover, 
the impetus for a larger swing. after this initial burst of energy, volume of-
ten dwindles. Wyckoff’s eloquent description of market forces is instructive:

The market is like a slowly revolving wheel: Whether the wheel will 
continue  to  revolve  in  the  same  direction,  stand  still  or  reverse  de-
pends entirely upon the forces which come in contact with it hub and 
tread. even when the contact is broken, and nothing remains to affect 
its course, the wheel retains a certain impulse from the most recent 
dominating force, and revolves until it comes to a standstill or is sub-
jected to other influences.1

Volume  is  best  interpreted  in  conjunction  with  the  price  range  and  the 
position of the close. In Figure 4.3, the bearishness of the upthrust and down-
ward reversal on 2a is underscored by the heavy selling pressure reflected in 
the  large  volume. The  breakdown  on  3a,  where  we  see  ease  of  downward 
movement and a weak close, tells a bearish story by itself. The large volume as 
prices fall below support indicates that the force of the selling has overcome 
the force of the buying. On 3b and 4a, prices glide lower on modest volume. 
here, the low volume—like the weak closes—indicates a lack of demand. 
The heavy volume on 4b reinforces the key reversal. Yet volume fails to show 
aggressive demand on 5a, 5b, and 6a as prices pump up and down in a small 
range. a large selling effort on 7a is overcome by buying as price recovers. The 
lack of reward for the effort would suggest that the buyers are gaining the up-
per hand. Then the bearish news hits the market on 7b, and price gaps below 
the previous low. The selling reaches a crescendo on 8a, but the weak close

still warns of lower prices. There is no downward progress on 8b as price gaps 
higher; however, it fails to clear the previous support line drawn across the low 
of 4b. The previous support line serves as resistance. But we cannot ignore the 
fact the volume on this up day is the second heaviest of any up day on the chart.

Figure  4.3  hypothetical Behavior

One can construct a story that buyers may have begun to emerge under 
cover of climactic volume on 8a. When a market is full of selling, buying 
often goes undetected. Demand appeared on 8b but it was not sufficient to 
break through the overhead resistance. It is the price/volume behavior on 9a 
and 9b—narrow ranges and low volume—that suggests the selling pressure 
is tiring. (One might question why 9a and 9b are not interpreted bearishly 
like 3b and 4a. The latter two days are in the midst of a decline. The former 
two  days  were  on  a  retest  of  a  high‐volume  low.)  But  because  the  closes 
on 9a and 9b remain close to their lows, a washout of 8a is still possible. 
This occurs on 10a. The diminished volume on 10a is noteworthy. since the 

c04.indd   54

entire down‐move began, this marks the lowest volume on a penetration of  
support. (Compare it with 3a and 8a.) The position of the close on 10a is 
near midrange, and, more important, above the low of 8a. It says the selling 
pressure is spent. On one level, the action on 10a represents a minor spring 
of  8a.  In  the  context  of  the  entire  down‐move,  we  see  shortening  of  the 
thrust (sOT) on 10a. Much of the gain on 10b is erased on the close. If this 
were a real trading situation, one would watch the character of the pullback 
from the high of 10b to see if the selling pressure is spent. If the volume con-
tracts, a low‐risk buying opportunity exists. another buying strategy would 
be to go long on a stop above the high of 10b.

Now  let’s  look  at  the  standard  &  Poor’s  (s&P)  continuation  chart  in 
2003. Figure 4.4 shows 17 days of price work beginning in the midst of an 
uptrend. What behavior most dominated the price movement? I am not re-
ferring to one particular day. I am not referring to trend lines or the volume. 
I am not referring to the market’s ability to make higher highs and lows. 
What behavior has repeatedly occurred to allow the uptrend to continue? 
subliminally, you know the answer. You only need to know the concept.

What is the most bearish behavior on the s&P chart (Figure 4.4)? how 
do you interpret the meaning of days 16 and 17 in the context of the over-
all chart? What do you expect to occur on day 18? What nearby price level

would have to be penetrated to indicate that the sellers are gaining the upper 
hand? If you were long, where would you place a protective stop? assume 
you went long on day 12. These are the kinds of questions we ask ourselves 
as we look over a chart.

From  my  perspective,  the  uptrend  in  Figure  4.4  is  sustained  by  the 
buyers’ repeated ability to overcome all selling efforts. expressed another 
way, whenever the sellers had an opportunity to drive prices lower, they 
lost  it. There  was  little  or  no  downward  follow‐through.  Days  3  and  4  
illustrate the point. The narrowing of the price range and the position of the 
close suggested that demand was tired after the big up‐move on day 2. The 
market probably encountered profit taking by longs. Thus, day 3 warned of 
a correction. Day 4 increased the likelihood of a deeper pullback. here, the 
market rallied above the previous day’s high, reversed below the previous 
day’s low, and closed on a weak note. The advantage had seemingly shifted 
to the sellers. Yet the lack of follow‐through on day 5 prompted new buy-
ing and the uptrend resumed. after racing upward on days 5 and 6, traders 
again took profits. Note the position of the close on day 6, which says the 
market encountered selling. The lack of follow‐through selling on day 7 set 
the stage for an additional round of buying. again, we see that the market 
encountered selling on day 10, as reflected in the position of the close. The 
most  bearish  behavior  occurred  on  day  11  as  most  of  the  previous  three 
days’ gains were erased; however, the sellers once again failed to capitalize 
on the market’s vulnerability. Finally, the slight upward progress and small 
gain on day 14 warned that demand might be tiring. The market gave ground 
easily on day 15, but no sustained selling emerged as price surged to a new 
high on day 16.

This brings us to the question about days 16 and 17, not in the abstract, 
but within the context of the entire chart. The sharp break on days 10 and 
11 can be likened to a soldier’s wound. It’s not a mortal wound, but it re-
quires time to heal. Thus, the market rests or consolidates in a trading range. 
The  balance  between  the  forces  of  supply  and  demand  shifts  on  day  16. 
here, the market displays ease of upward movement, closes on the high, and 
closes at the highest price on the chart. The bullish flag flies high again; the 
bulls reign. Day 17, however, raises concerns: little upward follow‐through, 
narrow price range, and a midrange close. This warns that demand may be 
spent. a narrow price range on a move to new highs should not be disre-
garded, as it often leads to weakness.

On day 18 (Figure 4.5), the s&P failed to exceed the previous day’s high 
and fell below its low. The close softened the bearish message by ending in

midrange and slightly lower. still, we have to be concerned with the narrow 
ranges that suggest an upthrust has occurred. The flip side of the argument 
says the market is undergoing absorption. On a retest of a previous resis-
tance level, the buyers must absorb the liquidation by longs who bought on 
day 10, the profit taking by longs who bought at lower levels, and the new 
short selling attracted to the high price. Therefore, we have to weigh the po-
tential upthrust against the possibility that absorption may be taking place. 
anyone long should raise stops to below the low of day 18.

The answer becomes apparent on day 19 (Figure 4.6). after a brief at-
tempt to rally on the opening, the s&P plunged below the lows of the past 
two days. Much of the gains made on day 16 are erased. Notice how the 
daily volumes all look the same and tell us little about the force of the buying 
and selling. We mostly have to rely on the size of the range and the position 
of the close to read the chart. The sellers have now gained the upper hand, 
and the breakout above the trading range was indeed an upthrust. The les-
son here is simple: always be on guard when a market moves above previ-
ous highs and the range narrows. Determining the resolution of a trading 
range is made easier by more price history. For example, the break from the

high of day 10 to the low of day 11 marked the largest two‐day decline in 
over three months. This bearish change in behavior glared forth on the daily 
chart. shorts established on a stop below day 18 would have been protected 
with a stop above the day 17 high. The stop should then be lowered to the 
high of day 19.

Figure 4.7 shows the next eight trading sessions. after day 21, the market 
makes little downward progress. The reversal action on day 23 looks quite 
threatening as prices close below the lower boundary of the trading range. 
although there was no immediate follow‐through selling, the market was 
unable to rally away from the danger point. When prices persistently hug 
the low of a trading range, the odds favor at least a washout and many times 
a sharp down‐move. (Notice how days 24 through 26 hold within the range 
of day 23.) On day 27, the market fell below the lows of the previous six 
days and reversed upward into the trading range. This created a potential 
spring of the trading range that began from the high of day 10. The low on 
day 27 is in the “crisscross area” between the high of day 4 and the low of day 
7 around the 962 line. Demand appeared on the up‐move from day 7 and 
it re‐emerged on day 27. We are viewing the chart like a tape reader, with

on reactions.

as shown in Figure 4.8, the spring on day 27 was tested two days later 
where the volume diminished and price closed well off the low. Demand 
returned on day 30, as indicated by the ease of upward movement and 
the strong close. On day 31, however, the range narrowed as the market 
approached the top of the range. Because of the firm close, it seemed 
that the buyers could be absorbing the overhead supply. Then we have a 
fairly mild outside downward reversal on day 32. The market gave fur-
ther ground on day 33, but there is no downward follow‐through on day 
34. This opens the door for another test of the overhead resistance. On 
day 35, prices rally above the day 32 high but give ground and close near 
the  low  of  the  session.  supply  has  been  encountered,  as  indicated  by 
the weak price action and the increased volume. Day 36 seals the mar-
ket’s fate. here, another attempt to clear resistance fails and the market 
closes nearer the low of the day. The odds favor another downswing. It 
continues until august 5 and ends with a spring of the day 27 low. From 
there, prices rise for six months.

a portion of the six‐month uptrend is shown on Figure 4.9 of the Dow 
Jones Industrial average. It begins from the November 21, 2003, low, the 
steepest phase of the uptrend. For this study, I have included a true range 
histogram below the price work. Its setting is one rather than a comparison 
with other days’ readings. as you will see, daily ranges can be interpreted 
like volume; they serve as an excellent proxy for volume. The actual volume 
did not provide as much differentiation between high and low readings. I 
remember the day, January 2, 2004, when I noticed a change in behavior.  
On  this  day,  the  Dow  had  its  first  outside,  downward  reversal  since  the  
November low. Most notably, its range was the largest of any previous down‐
bar. I thought this was a bearish change in behavior; however, the following 
day erased all of this weakness. Five days later (1/9), the Dow sold off with 
another wide range. On January 13, we see another wide‐range downward 
reversal. Notice how the declines on January 9 and 13 tested the January 
2 range. Yet the position of the close on the 13th indicated the presence of 
buying. Over the next eight sessions, the Dow rallied 340 points. The pace 
of the move was more labored than the advance in December. But the big in-
traday rally on January 21 spanned 153 points, the largest in several months. 
another strong performance occurred on January 26. at first glance, the 
buyers  seemed  in  total  control. Yet  there  was  no  upward  follow‐through 
on the next day, and on January 28, the market suffered its largest intraday

sell‐off since april 2003, washing away all the gains made between January 21  
and  26. This  was  a  serious  change  in  behavior.  Bob  evans,  the  most  well 
known of Wyckoff teachers, would say to put “a wad of peanut butter” on 
this bar so as to keep it foremost in mind. (a friend used to write the word 
wad in bold letters on his charts.) But the selling quickly abated, and prices 
held for six sessions in a narrow range.

The next upswing culminated with a strong performance on February 11,  
where the Dow gained 174 points from the low, closed on the high, and 
made a new high for the year. although the buyers appeared in control, the 
rally stalled for five consecutive sessions. On the fifth day, February 19, the 
buyers pushed the market to a fractional new high before it reversed to close 
near the day’s low. at this point, all of the behavior from January 2 came into 
focus and said to expect a larger sell‐off. The buying effort on March 1 was 
totally erased the next day, where prices closed near the previous day’s low. 
On March 3 and 4, the Dow held in narrow ranges. Their significance cannot 
be minimized. They mark the spot, dead center in the middle of the trading

range, where, if the bulls were to regain control, the market must rally. On 
the surface, March 5 looks ambiguous: prices pumped up and down, settled 
in midrange and barely closed higher. Who won the struggle—the buyers or 
the sellers? We consider how the character of the up‐move changed between 
January 13 and 26, the wide‐open break on January 28, the buyers’ lost op-
portunities after February 11 and March 1, and the upthrust on February 19.  
In  this  context,  the  indecisiveness  on  March  5  underscores  the  market’s  
vulnerability.

On Monday, March 8, the Dow turned down and closed near the previ-
ous day’s low. It left no doubt about a larger downturn in the stock indices. 
For the Dow, this marked the beginning of a 600‐point decline. The Dow’s 
vulnerable position after March 5 was reinforced by the action in several of 
the other stock indices/averages. For example, by March 5, the Dow Trans-
portation average  had  experienced  its  largest  sell‐off  in  over  a  year. The  
Nasdaq Composite had suffered a similar break. On March 5, the cash s&P and  
Russell 2000 rallied to their highest levels of the year. When they reversed 
downward on March 8, their upthrusts trumpeted the bearish message.

In  the  discussion  of  Figure  4.9,  the  intraday  sell‐offs  on  January  2,  9, 
and 28 stood out as bearish changes in behavior. In his tape reading course, 
Wyckoff stated that uptrends end when the “selling waves begin to increase 
in time and distance or the buying waves shorten.” he was referring to the 
uptrend, or upswings, on intraday wave charts. From a tape reader’s per-
spective, the widening price ranges on these three down days can be viewed 
in  the  same  light.  Narrow  ranges  are  equally  important. Wyckoff  and  his 
later associates certainly recognized their significance. Based on their mod-
els of accumulation and distribution, narrow ranges play an important role 
in defining the final turning point within a trading range prior to markup 
or markdown. Of course, as illustrated in the preceding discussion, narrow 
ranges tell us something about ease of movement—especially when we fac-
tor in the position of the close.

Narrow ranges play a major role in the analytical writings of Toby Crabel, 
the legendary trader/analyst who, after publishing a book dealing with his 
discoveries about the nature of markets, attempted to buy back each copy 
from the publisher. a few of these slipped through the cracks and quickly 
became rare books. In his book, Day Trading with Short Term Price Patterns and 
Opening Range Breakout, Toby Crabel cites the work of arthur Merrill as a 
source of inspiration. But he also displays a thorough understanding of Wyck-
off’s concepts of the Last Point of supply and Last Point of support as the 
source for a particular narrow‐range pattern. Crabel approaches  Wyckoff

from the perspective of a quantitative analyst. he tested day trading results 
based on buying or selling opening range breakouts from several combina-
tions of narrow‐range days. In a particularly salient passage, he wrote:

It should be clarified that although these tests are presented in a rough 
system format, it is not advised that they be traded as such. The purpose 
of all my work is to determine the markets’ nature. This market con-
cept assists me with that. When applying the 2Bar NR [narrow range] 
(or any market concept), the full context of the market must be con-
sidered. I define market context as the integration of the trend, price 
action,  price  pattern  studies,  and  support/resistance. The  primary  is 
the trend and [it] overrides all other particulars of market context.2

The 2Bar NR represents the narrowest two consecutive days range when 
compared to any two‐day range during the last 20 market sessions. It repre-
sents what he calls the Principle of Contraction/expansion, which explains 
how markets alternate between periods of activity and periods of rest. By 
prescribing a relative size rather than a specified size, the concept of 2Bar 
NR works in either volatile or dull market conditions. In Figure 4.9, a 2Bar 
NR occurred on March 3–4. Prior to the opening on March 5, we knew 
the market was in a position from which it had to rally. That the up‐move 
on March 5 failed to hold adds to our understanding of the market’s vulner-
ability. I have also circled two other instances of 2Bar NR. The action on 
February 9–10 did produce a one‐day, bullish response. Crabel quantifies 
several other narrow price configurations. One notable pattern, the 3Bar 
NR, is defined as the narrowest three‐day price range within the previous 
20  market  days.  Regarding  this  pattern,  he  makes  some  insightful  com-
ments:

The  psychological  implications  of  a  pattern  of  this  type  [3Bar  NR] 
are  interesting.  In  general,  as  the  pattern  is  forming,  speculators  are   
absent. In fact they tend to ignore a market that has contracted to such 
an extent. This is the point where the market is most ready to move 
and presents an explosive opportunity. It is ironic that so little initial 
interest is given to the move out of this pattern. It is well‐trained trad-
ers that recognize these opportunities and provide for the force that 
takes the market into a trend. I suggest that the patterns be looked at

very  carefully as they form in order to anticipate the upcoming action. 
again the quantification of this pattern allows you to do just that. The 
tests show several things: 1) That there is a market tendency for the 
market to trend intraday the day after the pattern has formed; 2) That 
the overall trend of the market has an impact on the pattern’s ability to 
continue the trend 2 to 5 days after the pattern has formed. This is dif-
ferent from the 2Bar NR which shows trending in the direction of the 
breakout regardless of the trend.”3

On the Dow chart, a 3Bar NR formed during February 3–5. These three 
narrow  days  formed  within  the  range  of  February  2.  since  Crabel  found 
Inside Days to be “precursors of trending action,” this particular 3Bar NR 
had greater potential, as proven by the resulting 250‐point rally. Wyckoff 
referred to such price tightness as a hinge. It can be likened to the hinge 
that allows a door to swing open. a hinge is the precursor to a price swing. 
a hinge on a weekly or monthly chart usually leads to many of the biggest 
swings. Crabel tested another narrow‐range pattern called an NR4. It con-
sists of a day with a daily range that is narrower than each of the previous 
three days ranges. Favorable test results were also observed when the NR4 
occurred as an inside day (ID/NR4). This pattern appears less frequently 
than the NR4. an ID/NR4 occurred on December 24, but the holiday trad-
ing  conditions  diluted  its  impact.  November  21  and  28  are  typical  of  an 
NR4. The minor spring and position of the close on November 21 gave the 
NR4  a  more  compelling  story. as  we  have  seen, Wyckoff’s  method  inte-
grates price range, position of close, volume, and the interaction with sup-
port/resistance and trend lines to explain what is taking place on a chart. 
Crabel, however, focuses on a setup that will produce a trend day to allow a 
successful day trade or a 2‐ to 5‐day swing. It often increases the immediacy 
of the more intuitive Wyckoff approach.

Crabel strives for specific day‐trading rules. Wyckoff reads the  struggle 
between  buyers  and  sellers  without  hard‐and‐fast  rules.  For  example, 
the four days between February 12 and 18 held within the range of the 
11th.  February  12  is  the  only  ID/NR4.  but  it  produced  no  trend  day. 
Cumulatively, these four inside days put the burden of proof on the bears. 
This tightness said the market is not giving ground; the buyers are try-
ing  to  absorb  the  overhead  supply;  watch  the  character  of  the  next  up‐
move. The  poor   performance  on  the  following  day  shifted  the  story  to

the  bearish side. This is the way I prefer to combine Crabel’s work with 
Wyckoff’s methods.

With these thoughts in mind, we turn to U.s. steel in the midst of an 
uptrend (Figure 4.10). In late October 2003, this stock jumped above the 
major  resistance  at  22. When  demand  overcame  supply  (D/s),  the  price 
ranges widened and volume increased. Upward progress slowed above 24. 
On November 5 (point 1), the reversal action warned of a correction. Two 
days later (point 2), the stock attempted to test the high; however, the range 
was  narrower  than  any  of  the  previous  six  days  (NR7),  and  price  closed 
unchanged in the middle. The breakdown on the next day called for fur-
ther weakness. In the last four days of the decline, the price ranges narrow 
and volume contracts—ideal behavior on a test of a breakout. Long posi-
tions should be established on the next day’s opening with a stop just below 
20.95, the low of the bars where demand overcame supply. The last three 
days also meet the definition of a 3Bar NR. here we have arrived at a point 
where  both  trading  methods  demand  action. The  price/volume  behavior 
gives us the ideal pullback to test a breakout (cf. Figure 1.1, Where to Find 
Trades), and the 3Bar NR indicates to go long (short) on a specified number 
of  points  above  (below)  the  opening  range.  given  the  underlying  bullish 
trend, a long position would be preferred.

as you can see in Figure 4.11, U.s. steel made higher highs, lows, and 
closes for six consecutive sessions. On the sixth day (12/1), the range ex-
panded to 1.64 points, the largest since October 30 when the true range 
equaled 1.97 points. This ease of upward movement occurs on the break-
out above the November high. The up‐move stalled over the next three 
sessions as longs took profits. One would normally expect the stock to 
pull back and test the breakout. The shallow correction, however, gives 
no one an opportunity to buy more cheaply on weakness; it testifies to 
the underlying strength of the trend. as noted, Crabel considers inside 
days  to  be “precursors  of  trending  action.” These  3  days  might  be  con-
fused with a 3Bar NR, except 3 narrower days occurred within the last 
20 days (at the November low). again, given the shallowness of the rang-
es and the clustering of closes, the odds favor further upward progress. 
at first glance, day 3 looks disappointing. here, the stock rallies above 
the highs of the previous four sessions and reverses to close unchanged 
and near the low of its range. In many ways, it looks like the behavior in 
the  Dow  on  February  19  (Figure  4.9).  But  the  cumulative  behavior  in 
that instance pointed to a downturn; not so in U.s. steel. Within the bell‐
shaped curve of probabilities regarding the next day’s performance, day 3 
warns of a potential upthrust. Instead, the stock gaps higher on the next 
day (December 8)—almost above the high of point 3—and races upward 
with widening price spread (1.99‐point true range) and a firm close. The 
strong gap opening is at the extreme of probabilities. Yet an alert trader 
must  react  immediately  to  the  situation. as  the  stock  races  above  the 
previous day’s high, an aggressive trader should buy more shares and pro-
tect with a stop immediately below the previous day’s close. There is no 
guarantee of success, but the sequence of behavior favors a continuation 
of the uptrend. While I have made no statistical study of such bullish lift-
offs, my experience says the vast majority occur in an uptrend. although 
the action on day 3 suggests an upthrust, it’s not unusual for them to fail 
within  an  uptrend  just  as  downtrends  are  littered  with  failed  springs. 
More on this later.

The Principle of Contraction/expansion can be seen at work in Figure 4.12. 
after December 8, the stock holds for two days in a narrow range. The second of 
these holds inside the first. Yet, compared to the volume on previous down‐
bars since the November low, here the down‐volume is the heaviest. It indi-
cates the presence of demand as the large selling effort makes no downward 
progress. Finally, notice how prices held both days on top of the December  
8  high.  Once  again,  we  see  shallow  corrections  that  lock  out  would‐be

buyers. The  trend  resumes  (December  11)  with  a  widening  price  range 
equaling  1.97  points.  here,  the  volume  swells  to  the  highest  level  since 
april. It may signal climactic action or the beginning of a steeper rise. We 
do know the stock has reached an overbought point within the up‐channel. 
On December 12 (point 4), volume swells to an even higher level. The two 
days’ combined volume could  be indicative  of  a  buying  climax. a sell‐off  
below  the  low  of  these  two  days  (28.11)  could  threaten  the  uptrend,  so 
stops on long positions are raised to 28.09.

U.s. steel gaps higher on December 15 (Figure 4.13), with a true range 
equaling 1.26 points, the fourth largest since November 21. On the fol-
lowing day (point 5), the stock closes 55 cents lower, the largest loss since 
the  up‐move  began.  Incredibly,  this  also  marks  the  first  time  the  stock 
closed  below  a  previous  day’s  low. Yet,  on  December  17,  the  stock  re-
verses  upward  to  close  above  the  highs  of  the  past  two  days. after  the 
strong performance on December 18, stops can be raised a few cents be-
low 30.51, the low of the previous session. a steeper up‐channel is drawn 
off the lows of December 11 (28.11) and December 17. as the uptrend 
progresses, we notice two inside days on December 23 and 24 (point 6). 
The latter is an NR7 and the stock holds on top of the December 18 high. 
holiday trading conditions explain the low volume on the next day. On

December 29, the stock has another 1.97‐point range and reaches the top 
of the up‐channel. It then moves laterally for five sessions while holding 
on top of the previous high. Two of the five days warn of a larger correc-
tion. First and foremost is the price action on December 30. This stands 
out as the most bearish change in behavior since November 21. here the 
stock had its largest intraday break and its largest loss—all on an inside 
day. Compare the price action on this day to the Dow on January 2, 2004 
(Figure 4.9). second, the last day on the chart makes a slight new high but 
fails to hold its gains, thus creating a potential upthrust. These are minor 
changes in behavior and only point to a correction. a swing trader would 
take profits, while the position trader would keep stops at 30.51.The re-
sulting sell‐off bottomed nine sessions later at 33.19. The larger up‐move 
peaked  in  March  2004,  two  months  after  our  study  ended,  at  40.15. a 
large base formed in U.s. steel between November 2000 and March 2003. 
The point‐and‐figure count made across this base projected a maximum 
rise to 43.

Drawing from the information already presented about reading bar charts, 
look at the price rise in October 2012 sugar (Figure 4.14) and make as many 
observations as you can regarding the lines and the price/volume behavior. 
They nicely explain what has taken place and build a solid argument for the

market’s future direction. starting from the liftoff on June 2, I have num-
bered  every  fifth  day  for  reference  points. The  last  day  shown  is  number 
34. Imagine you are examining this chart after the close on day 34, and you 
begin by framing the price movement with horizontal and diagonal lines. 
here are my notes:

 1.  horizontal lines are drawn across the highs of day 2 (20.29), 12 (21.14), 
24 (23.05), and 32 (23.99). They depict the shortening of the thrust on 
the successive up‐waves. smaller horizontal lines are drawn across day 3 
and 26 lows. a spring occurs on the small sell‐off below day 3.

  2.  The reverse‐trend line comes closest to pinpointing the high; it is drawn 

across the high of day 2 and 21.

  3.  a  parallel  line  drawn  across  the  low  of  day  8  creates  a  reverse‐trend 

channel. Note the low on day 30 holds on this line.

  4.  a second parallel line can be drawn across the low of day 14.
  5.  as  we  saw  on  Figure  4.4,  the  uptrend  was  perpetuated  because  the 
threatening  price  bars  failed  to  produce  greater  weakness.  In  other 
words, lack of downward follow through. The threatening price action 
occurred on day 2, 13, 17, 21, 24, and 26. With the exception of day 26, 
each of these down days was accompanied by heavy volume. With the 
exception of day 2, all of them had wide ranges.

  6.  The volume on day 32 stands out as the largest on the chart. Its range is 

the third largest of the up days. It signals climactic behavior.

  7.  When viewed together, the movement from the bottom of day 30 to the 
high of day 32 is the steepest three‐day rise on the chart (179 points), 
thus underscoring the climactic action.

  8.  On day 33, the market tried to turn down but prices recovered to close 
near the high and only slightly lower. The lack of upward follow‐through 
after day 33 adds to the bearish picture.

at this point, one should have understood the factors that prolonged the 
up‐move from the June low and recognized the market’s vulnerability at the 
close of day 34. The next eight sessions are shown on Figure 4.15. The nar-
row range on day 35 certainly gave the buyers another chance to take prices 
higher as the market held on top of day 24. We could not have known the 
market would have its largest down‐bar on the next day, yet it happened.  
Day 36 is an overtly bearish change in behavior because of its true range, 
high  volume,  and  weak  close.  It  increases  the  likelihood  of  a  much  larger 
down‐move. Over the next three sessions, however, sugar holds above the 
line drawn across the low of day 26. an outside, downward reversal occurs 
on day 39 but the position of the close lessens the bearish message for that 
session. On day 40, price slips below the support line but recovers to close 
near the high and only 0.08 points lower. here, we have a potential spring and

once again cannot rule out another attempt to rally. Day 41 is the coup de grace: 
no upward follow‐through with the close below the previous day’s low. at this 
point, we know with near certainty that prices are headed lower. The mark-
down should begin in earnest. Instead, the range narrows, volume diminishes, 
and the contract closes a mere four ticks lower on the last day. Imagine you 
went short on day 34 or 41. Do you believe the last day’s action negates the 
preponderance of bearish behavior that preceded it? Does it warrant closing 
out the short position? here, we have one of those moments in the evolution 
of a trade where we have to be willing to expose ourselves to the unknown.  
I call it “finding out expense.” From the close of day 42, October sugar fell  
183 points over the next nine sessions. each day in this decline had a lower 
high, low, and close. each close settled below the low of the preceding day.

From the examples presented in this chapter, you should be better pre-
pared  to  read  any  bar  chart—intraday  to  monthly—with  much  greater 
ease. Instead of analyzing an array of indicators or algorithms, you should 
be able to listen to what any market says about itself. such powerful knowl-
edge comes from repeatedly observing the story of the lines and the price/
volume behavior together.

Springs

73

When I speak at workshops or traders camps, I introduce the subject of 

springs and upthrusts with the following statement: You can make 
a living by trading springs and upthrusts. Once you become attuned 
to the behavior of a spring (and upthrust) your eyes will be opened to an 
action signal that works in all time periods. The spring can provide the im-
petus for a short‐term pop playable by day traders or serve as the catalyst 
for long‐term capital gains.

For me, a spring is a washout (penetration) of a trading range or support 
level that fails to follow through and leads to an upward reversal. The dura-
tion of the trading range does not have to meet a prescribed amount. My 
view  comes  from  years  of  tracking  intraday  price  movement  where  four 
days’  bond  data,  for  example,  represent  320  price  bars  on  a  five‐minute 
chart (day session only). A washout of a support level or trading range con-
sisting  of  320  price  bars  suddenly  looks  like  a  worthwhile  trading  situa-
tion. The  potential  gain  created  by  a  spring  on  a  five‐minute  or  monthly 
chart is a function of the underlying trend, market volatility and point and 
figure preparation. This last statement points to three important concepts 
regarding springs. First, when a market breaks below a well‐defined sup-
port line and fails to follow through, I consider it to be in a “potential spring 
position.” In other words, the lack of follow‐through raises the possibility 
of an upward reversal or spring. It does not guarantee a spring. As we will 
see, the price/volume behavior and broader context surrounding the spring 
situation  help  determine  its  probability  and  significance.  Second,  springs 
in an uptrend have a higher percentage of success. Contrarily, if a poten-
tial spring in a downtrend fails to develop, short sellers gain useful trading 

c05.indd   73

3/21/2013   3:06:38 PM

information. Third, a market’s volatility often dictates the size of a spring’s 
upward reversal. The amount of preparation, that is, the size of the trading 
range, can also determine the magnitude of the up‐move generated by the 
spring. preparation refers to the amount of congestion on a point‐and‐figure 
chart that can be used to make price projections.

While Wyckoff did not write about springs per se, he discussed how mar-
kets test and retest support levels. These tests give the large operators an 
opportunity to gauge how much demand exists around well‐defined sup-
port levels. An engineered sell‐off below such support levels provides the 
ultimate test. If the breakdown fails to produce an onslaught of new sell-
ing, the large operator recognizes the supply vacuum and buys aggressively, 
thus producing fast reversal action. Declines below support levels are often 
aided by stop‐loss selling. As Humphrey neill wrote in his Tape Reading and 
Market Tactics, markets are “honeycombed with buying and selling orders.”1 
Some stop‐loss selling offsets long positions, while another portion may be 
new shorts entering on weakness in expectation of a larger decline. Market 
moves in reaction to bearish earnings reports or economic data often trig-
ger such stop‐loss selling. When prices fall below a support level, I visualize 
a boxing match. If a boxer knocks his opponent out of the ring and into the 
fifth row of seats, the opponent should not recover and return to the ring, 
slugging away with renewed vigor. The breakdown tilts the scales in favor 
of the sellers. They are supposed to capitalize on their advantage. When this 
fails to occur, one can go long with a stop below the low of the break. This 
is buying at the danger point where the risk is smallest; however, it does not 
mean we automatically buy every breakdown in hope of a reversal. We do 
not stand in front of onrushing trains and try to pick up loose change.

Since  a  decline  below  a  trading  range  raises  the  possibility  of  a 
spring,  you  may  wonder  what  size  sell‐off  fits  the  definition  of  a  spring.  
Unfortunately,  no  precise  rules  will  work,  but  guidelines  can  be  help-
ful. A  “relatively  small  penetration”  gives  the  right  look.  Such  terminol-
ogy  does  not  convey  much  meaning;  the  meaning  comes  through  ex-
perience  as  when  we  eye  a  board  and  say  it  measures  about  one  foot.  In  
Chapter 3, we discussed a wide‐open break (4/4/2000) on the QQQ chart 
(Figure 3.9). This portion of the chart is enlarged in Figure 5‐1, and it con-
cludes  with  the  price  action  on April  4.  Here,  the  original  trading  range

between March 10 and 16 spans 15.44 points. The sell‐off on April 4 falls 
12.69 points below 101.00 or 82 percent of the trading range. If we con-
sidered only the size of the break, we would rule out a spring, even though 
the stock recovered to close above the March 16 low. At the low on April 4, 
the stock had depreciated 14 percent from the previous day’s close and 12.5 
percent below the low of the trading range. The magnitude of this sell‐off 
portends much greater weakness ahead. As previously noted, the volume 
and the price range on April 4 were record levels at that time.

A few weeks later, QQQ stabilized and a trading range developed be-
tween 78 and 94.25 (Figure 5.2). The spring began on May 22 where the 
stock broke below 78 and reversed upward. At this point, the buyers ap-
peared to overcome the heavy selling; however, the buying evaporated on 
May 23 and prices reversed downward to close below the trading range and 
near the day’s low. The boxer has been soundly knocked out of the ring and 
into the fifth row of seats. He is not supposed to recover. Yet, on May 24, 
the stock reverses upward again and closes on a strong note above the lower 
boundary of the trading range. The heavy volume and strong close indicate 
the force of the buying has overcome the force of the selling. At its low-
est point, the decline below 78 netted a 7 percent reduction in price. (On

April 4 (Figure 5.1), one might have argued the buyers overcame the selling 
but the magnitude of the break far exceeded the norm—a pyrrhic victory 
for the buyers.)

not all springs occur on heavy volume. There are occasions when prices 
slip to new lows without a sharp expansion of volume and reverse upward. 
An example appears on the cocoa daily continuation chart (Figure 5.3) be-
tween April and July 2004. On May 18, cocoa broke below the April 21 low 
at 2196 and fell to 2170. prices reversed upward on May 18 to close above 
2196. The penetration of support required little effort and failed to attract 
an influx of new selling; therefore, a spring developed. I vividly remember 
this situation. I did not go long on May 18 and the lack of acceleration on 
May 19 kept me on the sidelines. On May 20, after the gap opening above 
the previous day’s high, I instantly went long and protected just under the 
unchanged level. The jump above the previous day’s high removed any doubt

about market direction. This acceleration led to a 175‐point rally but no sus-
tained trend. After the rally to the May high, prices returned to the bottom 
of the trading range. The market made several attempts to lift off, but its in-
ability to rally away from the danger point increased the chances for another 
breakdown. notice the poor closings on most of the quick up‐moves as the 
sellers repeatedly thwarted the rallies. The spring from the July low lead to 
a 450 point rally but to make the trade one would have had to buy quickly.

Many  springs  cause  fast,  profitable  trades  without  triggering  bigger 
moves. They give great action signals for 1‐ to 10‐day swings. Figure 5.3 
shows a second spring on July 2, where prices dropped to 2158 with a mod-
est increase in volume. Since this decline penetrated the previous low by 
one point, we could say a minor spring occurred on the test of the earlier 
spring. Such behavior is not out of the ordinary and sometimes occurs with 
an even larger penetration on the second spring. Time will tell if the second 
spring starts a sustained up‐move; however, because the sellers again lost 
their advantage, the odds favor a larger advance. The two breakdowns on this 
chart fell a tiny percentage below their trading range. One might surmise 
that the low volume, which reflected a lack of selling pressure, contributed 
to the small penetration. Sometimes, however, a small breakdown will oc-
cur on heavy volume prior to a spring. When this happens, we should take 
note of the large effort and little reward: it says someone is taking all the 

c05.indd   77

3/21/2013   3:06:38 PM

supply—especially if price closes well off the low; a weak close would keep 
the outcome in doubt.

On March 10, 2004, Caterpillar (Figure 5.4) fell 1.38 points (3.6 percent)  
below  its  February  low.  Here,  we  have  ease  of  downward  movement,  a 
weak close, and a large increase in volume. At the end of the day, the sellers 
have gained control; however, a change in behavior occurs on March 11—
the daily range is half the size of the previous day, yet the volume remains 
about the same. On a closing basis, the stock loses a meager $0.18. We pay 
attention to the big effort and little reward. The heavy volume and slight 
downward progress tell us buying emerged at lower levels. They warn of a 
potential spring. On Friday, March 12, the stock rallies and closes above the 
high of the previous day, increasing the likelihood of a spring. The narrow‐
range inside day on March 15 does not reflect aggressive selling; it is a clas-
sic secondary test of a spring. Based on this minimal evidence, an aggressive 
trader might establish a long position on the opening of the next day with 
a stop below 36.26. Many springs—especially those where the breakdown 
occurred  on  heavy  volume—are  retested. The  test  of  a  spring  offers  an 
excellent  opportunity  to  go  long  as  it  represents  higher  support.  Ideally, 
the daily range should narrow and the volume taper off on the secondary 
test of a spring. Yet, no one should depend on exact adherence to the ideal.

On  the  Caterpillar  chart,  another  secondary  test  occurred  on  March  22. 
Here, the stock fell below the February support line but recovered to close 
above it; volume decreased to the lowest reading since the breakdown on  
March 10. On the QQQ chart (Figure 5.2), the secondary test on Friday, 
May 26, looks typical with a midrange close slightly above the previous day’s 
close and a distinct drop in volume. One would go long on the next day’s 
opening  and  protect  below  the  low  of  May  26. After  the  secondary  tests 
on the QQQ and Caterpillar charts, prices rose $22 and $4, respectively.  
neither  of  these  springs  occurred  at  the  bottom  of  a  major  decline. The 
spring in QQQ occurred within the confines of a larger top formation, and 
the Caterpillar spring developed in the midst of an unresolved top forma-
tion. Keep in mind the model of “Where to Find Trades.” As previously stat-
ed, many trades occur around the edges of trading ranges. Some will lead to 
prolonged moves; others will be short lived.

When  the  initial  breakdown  occurs  on  heavy  volume,  the  propensity 
exists  for  a  secondary  test.  Springs  following  a  low‐volume  breakdown, 
like the two on the cocoa chart, are tested less often. But we find plenty 
of ambiguity regarding springs and secondary tests. now look at the IBM 
chart (Figure 5.5). On August 6, 2003, the stock penetrated the bottom of 
a two‐month trading range and reversed to close well above the day’s low. 
It also closed at a price equal to the bottom of the trading range. Thus, the 
attempted breakdown was a failure. This brief washout occurred with no 
increase in volume. prices bobbed back into the trading range and then held 
in a narrow range between August 11 and 14. Here, the stock displayed a 
distinct  unwillingness  to  move  lower,  as  indicated  by  the  position  of  the 
closes during these four days. This behavior represents a secondary test of 
the spring in which prices hold at a higher level instead of returning closer 
to  the  actual  low. The  holding  action  during  this  secondary  test  revolved 
around the high of August 11. As soon as the stock closed above this minor 
resistance level, price rallied toward the downtrend line before encounter-
ing resistance near 85. The upward spike and weak close on Friday, August 
22,  indicated  the  stock  would  sell  off  again. notice  how  the  stock  found 
support once more on top of the August 11 high. Between August 26 and 
29 (see circled area), the four closings clustered together within a 50‐cent 
range. With the exception of the narrow range on August 27, all of the closes 
were near the high of each day, indicating the presence of buying at lower 
levels. The narrow‐range inside day on August 29 reflected a total lack of 
selling pressure. notice also how the price swings from the May high steadi-
ly contracted, with the smallest movement occurring on the decline from

the August 22 high. The stock is poised to rally. Wyckoff referred to this as a 
springboard. One can call it another test of the spring or a springboard; the 
message comes from the price/volume behavior, not the terminology. You 
only need to know how to read the three basic elements—price range, posi-
tion of the close, volume—and see them within the context of the lines and 
the larger time frames.

IBM Daily Chart 

The subject of larger time frames leads me to Union pacific (Figure 5.6),  
where  a  seemingly  minor  spring  occurred  in  March  2000.  The  daily 
chart  shows  a  10‐month  decline,  where  prices  stayed  within  a  well‐de-
fined  down‐channel,  repeatedly  found  support  around  the  demand  line 
of  the  channel,  and  each  important  support  level  served  as  resistance  on 
later rallies. I have included the low price at each of these support levels, 
as they reveal behavior that is akin to a spring. If we measure the amount 
of  downward  progress  from  May  to  February,  we  see  a  succession  of 
lows  that  are  4.66,  3.97,  and  1.56  points  apart. The  stock  lost  81  cents 
on  the  final  decline. Wyckoff  referred  to  this  behavior  as  shortening  of  the 
thrust.  (On  charts,  I  often  designate  this  behavior  with  the  abbreviation 
SOT; it also occurs on up‐moves.) Shortening of the thrust reflects loss of  
momentum. Whenever the volume becomes heavy at the low points of each 
down‐move and the downward progress diminishes, pay close attention. It 
means the big effort earned little reward because demand is emerging at 

c05.indd   80

lower levels. If the volume diminishes as the downward thrust shortens, we 
know the sellers are tiring. These same observations apply to a spring. A pen-
etration of support on heavy volume with only slight downward progress 
reflects little reward for the effort. A penetration of support on low volume 
and little downward progress says supply is spent. regarding the behavior 
on the Union pacific chart, we would say March 2000 represents shortening 
of the downward thrust within the context of the entire decline from the 
May 1999 low. Within the context of the trading range that began from the 
February 2000 low at 17.94, the 81‐cent drop to the March low is viewed as 
a spring. In Chapter 3, we observed an apex and spring on the daily Schlum-
berger chart (Figure 3.12). On its weekly chart (Figure 3.13), the sell‐off to 
the December 1998 low had shortening of the downward thrust. the main 
idea behind the notion of springs, upthrusts, and shortening of 
the thrust is lack of follow‐through. It goes to the heart of the matter.
The  details  of  the  spring  deserve  some  attention  before  we  look 
at  the  larger  context.  I  have  enlarged  the  Union  pacific  trading  range  
(Figure  5.7)  from  the  February  low  at  17.94.  On  March  13,  the  stock  
fell  to  17.13,  putting  it  slightly  below  the  demand  line  of  the  down‐ 
channel and thus creating a minor oversold condition. The narrowing of the 
price spread, low volume, and position of the close on this day indicated the 
selling pressure was at least temporarily spent. On March 14, the stock held 
in a narrower range and closed fractionally higher; it showed no willingness 
to return to the previous day’s low. The shortening of the downward thrust 
in  an  oversold  position  within  the  down‐channel  suggested  that  a  spring 
could happen. It occurred on March 15–16, where the wide price ranges 

c05.indd   81

reflected ease of upward movement. All of the selling from the March high 
was erased in two days. The low‐volume, grinding pullback into the middle 
of the vertical, liftoff range marked the secondary test of the spring. On the 
secondary test, a minor spring also occurred.

On  the  monthly  Union  pacific  chart  (Figure  5.8),  we  see  the  stock 
“backed and filled” for another five months between 23 and 18.50 before 
the trend turned up. But this chart also reveals something quite significant 
about the minor spring in March 2000. The down‐move in March washed 
out the August 1998 low, creating a spring of much larger degree. Therefore, 
the six‐month trading range between April and September 2000 was a sec-
ondary test of this larger spring. notice the narrowing of the price range in  
September 2000, the smallest in five years. It said the selling pressure was 
spent  and  the  stock  was  on  the  springboard  for  a  much  larger  up‐move.  
Attention  should  also  be  paid  to  the  price  tightness,  as  it  is  particularly 
meaningful  when  it  appears  on  monthly  charts. This  observation  is  most 
important.

Monthly charts are read in the same manner as daily charts with em-
phasis on range, position of the close, and volume. nowhere does this 
stand out better than on the monthly EWJ chart (Figure 5.9). After de-
clining for two years, this stock found support in February 2002 (point 
1). The initial rally met resistance at a previous breakdown point. prices 
then fell for five months to the October low (point 2), where support 
was  penetrated  and  volume  soared  to  48  million  shares.  Despite  the 
large effort, the stock closed in midrange and above the February low.

This   suggested  a  possible  spring,  but  the  stock  held  for  four  months 
without any ability to lift away from the danger point. The narrow range, 
weak  close  and  low  volume  in  February  2003  (point  3)  warned  of  a 
breakdown. In March and April (points 4 and 5), the stock fell to new 
lows on heavy volume. Here, we have no ease of downward movement 
and little reward for the effort; however, the April close provided a clue 
the stock could rally. The spring began with the turnaround in May. Sup-
ply was met in July (point 6), but it was absorbed in August and the stock 
rallied to 15.55 in May 2006.

Trading ranges lasting many years often contain numerous springs that 
provide  highly  profitable,  intermediate  up‐moves  without  ever  produc-
ing a major breakout. The soybeans quarterly continuation chart (Figure 
5.10)  presents  a  classic  example. Without  delving  too  deeply  into  the 
many springs on this chart, five stand out. From left to right, they pro-
duced gains of $6.36 (16 months), $3.87 (7 months), $6.32 (21 months), 
$2.31 (9 months), and $6.39 (27 months). A later spring from the 2006 
low gained $11.39 in 22 months, and it did represent a major breakout 
of the trading range shown here. not bad, considering one dollar in soy-
beans equals $5,000 per contract. Because of its tendency for multimonth 
springs, the soybean market is well worth studying closely. Several of these 
springs were preceded by upward reversals that initially failed to ignite 
larger moves. The preceding measurements are made from the final start-
ing points. prior to 1999, all of the springs occurred within the boundary 
created by the 1975 low and the 1977 high. The 1973 high was not retest-
ed until the 2008 rise to 16.63. The trend of commodities peaked in 1980 
and did not reach its bottom until 1999, the same year the soybean market 
broke below its 1975 low. The 1999 low in soybeans was tested several 
times but continued to hold until the process ended in January 2002. The 
price  action  between  1999  and  2002  is  a  terminal  shakeout  because  it 
came at the end of a prolonged trading range and evolved over a longer 
period  of  time. This  kind  of  price  action  often  will  resolve  a  multiyear 
trading range and start a much larger uptrend. While much of the rally 
from the 2002 low was erased in 2004, it ultimately served as a second-
ary test of the terminal shakeout. On the yearly soybean oil chart (Figure 
3.6), we observed a terminal shakeout of the 1975 low. It, too, occurred 
in  the  2001  period  and  produced  a  large  up‐move.  On  the  same  yearly 
chart, the trading range that began from the early 1950s was resolved by 
a less dramatic terminal shakeout in 1968.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (Figure 5.11) rallied to 1000 for the 
first time in 1966. From this high, it held for 16 years in a trading range 
where springs, upthrusts, a terminal shakeout, and an apex developed. The 
spring in August 1982 was accompanied by the heaviest monthly volume in 
the history of the stock exchange up to that time. Before August 1982, the 
daily new York Stock Exchange (nYSE) volume had never reached 100 mil-
lion shares, and that month it happened on five separate days. The monthly 
range in August 1982 was the second largest of all previous up months—
exceeded only by January 1976. Of course, October 1982 had the largest 
range for all previous up or down months. To dissect this spring we begin 
with the break from the 1981 high that found support at 807 in September. 
From this low, the Dow attempted to recover but ran out of steam above 
900 in December. The first quarter of 1982 saw more weakness, plus a new 
low in March, where we observe three important features: the close ended 
well off the low of the monthly range, it stood a fraction below the pre-
vious month’s close, and it recovered above the 1981 low. Together, these 
three features warned of a potential spring. Monthly nYSE volume in March 
1982 reached a historic high, yet the large selling effort netted only a small 
reward, which added to the bullish picture. A small spring occurred, but it 
met resistance above 850 in May. The pullback from the May high can be 
viewed as the test of the spring that developed from the March low. June 
looked like a successful secondary test of the spring as the Dow held its low 

c05.indd   85

and ended the month well off its low. In July, however, the rally sputtered 
and stopped, as evident by the position of the close. This set the stage for 
another test of the spring. In August, prices fell to a slight new low. Yet when 
the Dow recovered intramonth above the July high, the spring was in high 
gear. The liftoff exceeded the highs of the previous 11 months and heralded 
the beginning of a once‐in‐a‐lifetime bull market. One might ask why the 
spring in August 1982 had such a profound effect while the others failed to 
produce a sustained bull move. One obvious, nontechnical reason has to do 
with interest rates. Long‐term yields peaked in September 1981, and short‐
term yields fell sharply in August 1982. From a purely technical standpoint, 
the coiling of prices into an apex helped unleash such a powerful rally on 
the spring. Also, some of the longer‐term price cycles bottomed in 1982. 
The tediousness of the turnaround from the 1982 low testifies to the stock 
market’s uncanny ability to prolong a trend. We have seen the same kind of 
behavior throughout the 2011–2012 period. The subject of upthrusts will 
be dealt with in the next chapter but Figure 5.11 provides several excellent 
examples.

As  we  have  seen,  springs  in  long‐term,  volatile  trading  ranges  such 
as  shown  on  the  Dow  and  soybean  charts  often  provide  major  buying

 opportunities. Within daily uptrends, springs sometimes occur at the right‐
hand side of corrections. They can be used to pyramid long positions or get 
aboard after a trend has begun. Downtrends are littered with failed springs 
(see Figure 5.6). They create what I call a bottom picker’s nightmare, as they 
repeatedly entice traders to chase upward reversals. These are usually short 
lived and, when read correctly, can be used for establishing short positions. 
We will look first at two uptrends starting with the daily chart of Deere 
& Co. (Figure 5.12) between March and October 2003. The stock market 
made an important low in March 2003 that produced an orderly uptrend 
for about one year. On the daily charts of the S&p and other indices/aver-
ages, the reversal action at the March low was quite obvious. Deere followed 
the herd but without giving any overt indications prior to its liftoff. In oth-
er words, there was no climactic volume, no shortening of the downward 
thrust, no reversal action, and no oversold condition within the down‐chan-
nels from the December 2002 high. On the weekly chart (not shown), the 
decline from December 2002 to March 2003 did retest the July 2002 low. 
But nothing occurred from a price/volume perspective that pointed to the 
start of a large up‐move. Yet the stock rallied briskly off its low to the March 
21 high in concert with the broader market. Then the stock gave back most 
of its gains on the next correction. From this low, the stock gradually rose 
to the 22 level, where the heavy volume on May 12–13 indicated the pres-
ence of supply. A trading range formed for a few weeks prior to the minor 
breakdown on May 29. Volume rose to the highest level in 11 days, and price 
closed near the low of the day. The lack of downward follow‐through on the 
next day put the stock in a potential spring position. (It also increased the 
likelihood that the stock had been undergoing absorption around the level of 
the March high.) One could go long on May 30 or June 2 with a stop below 
the May 29 low. Even though the volume increased on the breakdown, no 
secondary test occurred. Making small bets on minor springs of this sort has 
a greater chance of success in an uptrend. The second spring resolved the 
trading range between the June high and July low. On July 16, the stock fell 
below the trading range and closed on a weak note; volume remained low.

One of my favorite kinds of springs occurred on the 17th. Here, the stock 
gapped higher—almost to the previous day’s high—and volume soared. This 
kind of spring action rarely works in a downtrend; in an uptrend, however, 
it  reinforces  the  bullish  story,  as  it  makes  would‐be  buyers  pay  up  to  own 
the stock and prevents others from getting aboard. On this spring, we have a 
low‐volume break, followed by high volume on the up day and the next day’s 
secondary test. Then the stock quickly rose above the June high. notice the

pullback in early August  that  tested  the breakout  where  demand  overcame 
supply, as depicted in Figure 1.1. price accelerated upward in August, and ul-
timately became mired in another trading range. On September 26, the stock 
fell below the lower boundary of this range without any increase in volume. 
(It tested the vertical acceleration of August 12.) The lack of volume and fol-
low‐through on the next day raised the possibility of a spring. I like to see such 
buoyant behavior. A narrow‐range inside day (9/29) holding just below the 
low of the range demands an immediate rally or lookout below. In a down-
trend, there would be little doubt of the outcome. Here, the underlying trend 
sweeps away all doubt as the stock rallies away from the danger point. The low 
volume on the September spring has added significance in that it tested the 
vertical, high‐volume area of August 12–13. The low volume reflected a lack 
of supply in an area where demand had previously overcome supply. Evidently, 
few trapped shorts were enticed to increase their position on the September 
26 breakdown. The stock reached 37.47 in April 2004.

The  uptrend  in  the  December  2004  Eurodollar  chart  (Figure  5.13) 
between  november  2003  and  March  2004  contains  numerous  springs 
and  tests  of  high‐volume  breakout  areas. The  chart  offers  an  exceptional 
study of the “story of the lines.” For background information, this contract 
peaked in June 2003 at 98.39 and declined to the August 2003 low at 96.87.

After consolidating for one month, prices rose sharply on September 4–5. 
This vertical liftoff provided the impetus for the rally to the October high, 
where the chart shown here begins. Quite naturally, the correction from the 
October high tested the area where prices rose vertically in early Septem-
ber. This correction is labeled as trading range AB. From the October low, 
a smaller trading range, BC, developed. Its first high point ended slightly 
within  the  daily  range  of  October  3,  where  prices  accelerated  lower  on 
increased  volume. The  high‐volume  sell‐off  on  november  7  broke  below 
ranges AB and BC, but the position of the close and the lack of reward for 
the effort suggested that a spring would occur. When the contract pressed 
upward two days later, one should have gone long with a stop below the 
immediate low. This spring accelerates upward on november 13–14 before 
petering out on Monday the 17th. On the latter day, the narrowing of the 
price range said the spring was losing momentum Of course, this was again 
in the area of the October 3 breakdown and also created a potential upthrust 
of trading range BC. An active trader might have taken profits or made a big-
ger bet by holding for the secondary test. The upthrust was not completed 
until november 21 and led to a test of the spring. On December 5, after the 
retest of the low, the contract rose sharply on heavy volume, erasing most 
of the previous down‐move. The ease of upward movement, strong close, 
and high volume augured for further price gains. prices first experienced a 
choppy holding action, as the buyers absorbed through the remaining supply 
before the breakout on December 11. The breakout was short lived as the 
contract met resistance on the next day. A new trading range, DE, formed 
essentially on top of BC and mostly within the price range of the Decem-
ber  11–12  breakout.  In  the  context  of  the  drawing  shown  in “Where  to 
Find Trades,” trading range DE is a more drawn‐out test of the breakout. Its 
resolution occurs with the spring on January 2. While the contract broke 
with ease on Friday, January 2, the minuscule volume suggested a washout 
of weak longs rather than supply overcoming demand. The low volume and 
narrow range on the next day underscored the lack of supply and provided 
an excellent place to go long (or even on the following day’s opening for 
traders  who  use  end‐of‐day  data).  In  the  next  three  sessions  (see  circled 
area), the market holds tightly against the resistance line as the buyers ab-
sorb through the overhead supply.

For traders who saw how the closes on these three days were clustered 
together and well above their respective intraday lows, the absorption area 
offered an excellent place to establish longs. On January 9, demand over-
comes supply as prices move upward with great ease and force. The rally

promptly stops on the next day; prices seemingly consolidate on top of re-
sistance line A and then push upward to another high (1/23). We immedi-
ately notice how the thrust shortened on the rally above the previous high 
(1/10) and prices reversed lower. Suddenly, we are faced with the possibil-
ity that the latest breakout has produced an upthrust of trading range AB. 
The swing trader takes profits; the active trader makes a bet on the short 
side, with a stop immediately above January 23. The potential upthrust be-
comes more plausible after the high‐volume, wide‐open break on January 
28. While this decline has tested the breakout and held on top of resistance 
line D, the weak close and large volume favor further weakness. It is the ac-
tion on January 29 that reduces bearish expectations. Here, the daily range 
narrows, prices close in midrange, and volume soars to the highest reading 
on the chart as the market returns to the previous absorption area. Some 
large interests were obviously buying in the face of heavy selling; thus, the 
contract made little downward progress. The swing trader might reestablish 
long positions with a stop slightly below 97.80 (the absorption area); any-
one determined to stay short should at least adjust stops to break even. We 
now have a new trading range, Fg, interacting with the tops of AB and DE. 
Support line g is almost an extension of resistance line D. On the subse-
quent rally, the narrowing of the daily ranges above 98.00 indicates demand 
is tiring. This leads to a pullback on February 6 to test the January 28 low. 
But the contract reverses upward with great force locking out anyone wait-
ing for a spring.

I began this chapter by saying how one can make a living trading springs 
and upthrusts. Statistically speaking, springs and upthrusts are not as preva-
lent as double tops and bottoms. Look through a chart book and you will find 
plenty of six‐month or one‐year uptrends without any springs. Yet trading 
strategies for handling these situations can be made. One strategy involves 
going long on the pullback after the high‐volume rally off a low. Many times 
there are shallow corrections into the range of the high‐volume day(s)—
such as after December 5, January 2, and February 6 in this study—that can 
be used for buying. Of course, other trades can be established in absorption 
areas or on tests of breakouts. After February 6, the contract experiences an-
other sharp run‐up on the 11th. Volume remains heavy and provides enough 
force to break out of trading range Fg. As occurred after the December 11 
and January 9 rallies, the ranges narrow as upward momentum tires. On 
February  18,  however,  the  contract  reverses  to  close  near  the  day’s  low, 
raising the possibility that trading range Fg has been upthrusted. We see the 
shortening of the upward progress as measured from the highs of line D, F,

and H. Yet, the ensuing correction, labeled trading range HJ, is shallow. It 
tests and holds within the vertical range of February 11 and ends with an 
almost imperceptible spring on March 3. The spring consists of a narrow 
range with a firm close above the bottom of the trading range. Huge demand 
appears on March 5 as the contract races to a new high. In retrospect, trad-
ing range HJ represents absorption around the top of trading range Fg and 
on top of AB.

The uptrend shown here has responded to one spring after another with 
great ease of upward movement and increased volume. Because of the heavy 
volume,  each  spring  quickly  dissipated,  leading  to  another  trading  range. 
This has not been a steady, grinding uptrend with the buyers in complete 
control—a  more  bullish  condition.  High  volume  throughout  an  uptrend 
reflects  the  presence  of  persistent  selling  that  has  to  be  absorbed  before 
the trend continues. After the high‐volume breakout on March 5, a small 
trading range, KL, formed on Figure 5.14. It ended with a tiny spring on 
March 16. Compare the character of the rally on this spring with the earlier 
reversals  on  Figure  5.12.  Suddenly,  the  daily  ranges  narrow  and  volume 
diminishes, indicating a lack of demand. The drying up of demand at the top 
of the March 2004 rally becomes more ominous when one considers that 

c05.indd   91

the move has barely exceeded the June 2003 high at 98.39. The topping ac-
tion is worth discussing. notice the weak position of the close on the top day 
(3/24) and how much of the spring was erased two days later. Yet on March 
31, the contract still had another opportunity to recover after the buyers 
did not allow further weakness and prices closed on a strong note. At this 
point, the market was in a position similar to December 4, January 5, and 
March 4. Instead, on April 1, there was no follow‐through buying and prices 
reversed to close at the low of the previous three sessions. The sellers had 
absorbed the buying around the March 16 low and gained the upper hand. 
One could have established a short position either on the close of April 1 
or the opening of April 2, with stop protection above the high of March 31. 
A spectacular sell‐off occurred on April 2 in response to a bearish employ-
ment report. Because prices closed off the low, one would have expected a 
knee‐jerk rebound. As you see, the daily ranges narrowed on the subsequent 
rally before the contract fell 100 points over the next three months. But the

failed spring on March 31–April 1 created the immediate, technical setup 
for  lower  prices;  the  shortening  of  the  upward  thrust  in  March  and  the 
upthrust of the June 2003 high painted a much larger bearish picture; the 
overtly bearish fundamentals provided the reason. now we’ll examine failed 
springs in a top formation.

The cotton market doubled in price between October 2001 and Octo-
ber 2003. The new‐crop December 2004 contract (Figure 5.15) peaked at 
71 cents and experienced a fast sell‐off to 62.50 in november 2003. From 
this low, the contract rebounded to 69.96 in January 2004 where our study 
begins. The  daily  chart  shows  the  top  formation  that  developed  between 
January and April 2004. It is marked by a number of failed springs, which 
underscored the growing strength of the sellers. rather than give a blow‐by‐
blow account of the action, I am touching on the main points. The springs 
on February 10 and March 9 throw prices back to the top of trading range 
AB. But the spring from the low of April 13 only retests the lower line of 
the trading range. From this last high, the downtrend accelerates on April 
28–29. The close on April 29 holds out the chance for a rebound, but it can-
not penetrate the downtrend line and more weakness follows. The sell‐off 
on April 29 is too deep to consider a spring. We have on this chart a series of

lower lows and highs revolving around axis lines A and C. The holding action 
at the right edge of the chart is part of an area where the sellers absorbed all 
buying and prices continued lower.

I know of no better trading strategy than the spring. It produces short‐
term intraday trades and ignites many long‐term trends. For risk manage-
ment, it offers a way to enter a trade at the danger point where the outcome 
will be quickly determined and the risk is minimal. When prices move be-
low a line of support, many traders back away for fear of greater weakness. 
The  professional  trader  knows  better.  He  watches  for  hesitation  or  little 
follow‐through and quickly takes advantage of the situation. An understand-
ing of the spring allows anyone to trade like a professional. And it will earn 
a nice yearly income.

Upthrusts

95

When a stock, index, or commodity moves above a previous line of re-

sistance and fails to follow through, one has to consider the potential 
for a downward reversal. Such a failed breakout is called an upthrust. Like a 
spring, it can occur in several ways and it may be retested at a later point. 
Like a spring, it offers a trading opportunity at the danger point where the 
risk is the least. It similarly  can provide a very fast  trading  turn  within  a 
trend or appear at a major top. I find upthrusts to be more difficult to trade 
than springs. One reason may be the public’s willingness to buy new highs. 
They are not as anxious to go short on new lows. Thus, we often can discern 
the professional buying more clearly on a spring. Professional selling at a top 
may be obscured under cover of the public buying—that’s the preferred en-
vironment for the professional trader who is working out of a long position 
and establishing shorts.

Because of the potential for an upthrust, I am not eager to buy breakouts. 
Jesse Livermore, in his book How to Trade in Stocks, expressed the opposite view:

It may surprise many to know that in my method of trading, when I see 
by my records that an upward trend is in progress, I become a buyer as 
soon as a stock makes a new high on its movement, after having had a 
normal reaction.1

Buying new highs is one of the mainstays of the Investor’s Business Daily 
trading philosophy. It works extremely well in a bull market. In his excel-
lent book, How to Make Money in Stocks, William O’Neil wrote: “The hard to

accept great paradox in the stock market is that what seems high and risky 
to the majority usually goes higher and what seems low and cheap usually 
goes lower.”2

It  takes  a  long  time  to  believe  this  wise  advice. Along  the  same  line,  I 
might add that the popular strategy of being a contrarian in the face of an 
established trend (up or down) can have disastrous results. So how do we 
know if a breakout above resistance will fail? The trend is the most impor-
tant consideration. As will be shown in this chapter, supposed upthrusts in 
an uptrend rarely pan out. In a downtrend, however, upthrusts above a pre-
vious correction high have a greater probability of working. They flourish.

There are almost an infinite number of ways an upthrust can occur. The 
first prerequisite is a previous high across which a resistance line is drawn. 
A  move  above  that  line  becomes  a “potential”  upthrust. The  rise  above  a 
previous high may not be the deciding price action. It’s often the cumulative 
behavior  on  the  preceding  price  bars  and  especially  the  succeeding  price 
bars that tell the story. Upthrusts can occur on any chart regardless of the 
time  period. When  a  market  trades  at  record  highs,  the  volatility  usually 
becomes greater than in many months. In such an environment, an upthrust 
on an hourly chart can produce a down‐move larger than the previous year’s 
range. I am thinking here of silver prices in 2011. Generally speaking, the 
upthrusts  on  weekly  charts  stand  out  most  clearly.  Figure  6.1  shows  the 
March–April 2011 top on the weekly chart of Silver Wheaton. A bearish 
change in behavior occurred in the week ending March 11, where prices fell 
7.74 points from high to low. This was the largest down week in the stock’s 
history. Four weeks later (April 8) the stock rallied to close above the March 
11 high. The buyers seemingly had regained the upper hand. Yet by the close 
of the next week, April 15, the stock had reversed downward. At this point, 
the cumulative behavior indicated an upthrust had occurred.

For the record, Figure 6.2 shows the daily chart of Silver Wheaton. here, 
the heavy selling in the March 11 week does not stand out. On the “break-
out” day, April 8, the narrowing of the range and the position of the close 
certainly would have raised suspicions about a potential upthrust. A narrow‐
range breakout does not speak of aggressive demand capable of resuming an 
uptrend. But it’s the high‐volume sell‐offs in the next two sessions, April 11 
and 12, that prove the sellers have taken control. Figure 6.2 embodies sev-
eral characteristics of an upthrust. First, the close on April 11 is below the 
low of April 8 and April 7. Thus, it totally erases the “breakout.” Second, it

is an unusually large down‐bar. The true range on April 11 is the largest for 
any down‐bar since November 10, 2010, almost exactly six months earlier. 
After the temporary low on April 12, notice how prices flailed up and down 
and repeatedly closed near the low end of the price bars.

On  January  3,  2011,  U.S.  Steel  (Figure  6.3)  reached  the  high  point 
(61.18) of a five‐month rally. After a sharp correction, the stock began an-
other up‐wave. The gap upward on February 15 exceeded the January high. 
Although the stock closed near the lower end of its range, the true range 
gives  the  close  a  stronger  pallor. Volume  increased  appropriately  and  the 
buyers seemed to have overcome the selling. The range narrowed on the next 
day as the stock made little upward progress, but the firm close still held 
open the possibility prices might be levitating higher. More narrowing of the 
range occurred on February 17, but the firm close and outside upward re-
versal kept the bullish story alive. We can make endless excuses for this weak 
rally, but it needs to make greater progress. Instead, the outside, downward 
reversal on February 18 is a bearish change in behavior. It offers an excellent

shorting opportunity with stop placement immediately above the previous 
day’s high. While the volume does not expand sharply, the close below the 
lows of the previous four sessions is sufficient evidence to say an upthrust 
has occurred. The wide‐open decline on Tuesday, February 22, triples the 
odds for lower prices. It will be many years before the high of this day is 
exceeded.  Notice  the  price  action  on  February  2.  here,  the  stock  barely 
penetrated  its  January  high  and  reversed  lower. Two  days  later,  the  same 
bearish price action occurred. When working with a stock priced at $60, I 
rarely consider an 18‐cent new high to be an upthrust. It’s a secondary test 
or, perhaps, a double top. A fractional new high on a $2 stock could be an 
upthrust. Overall, there is no precise size measurement for an upthrust to 
fulfill. A new high by 10 to 15 percent seems a reasonable limitation for an 
upthrust. Gold futures peaked in March 2008 at 1040. In December 2009 
they reversed downward from 1240. This was not an upthrust of the 2008 
high. It was the top of a rally within the uptrend.

The Standard & Poor’s (S&P) is notorious for its springs and upthrusts. 
Many of its major extremities were resolved by these two kinds of behav-
ior. Its 60‐month advance from the October 2002 low was littered with up-
thrusts. They produced either short‐lived declines or lateral movement but 
no  serious  downturn.  Eight “potential”  upthrusts  can  be  identified  on  the 
Cash S&P monthly chart (Figure 6.4). Among these, five were outside down-
ward reversals. Numbers 1, 4, and 8 were the exceptions. The average sell‐off 
on the first six upthrusts was 88 points. With the exception of the correction 
from the high of number 2, the down‐moves never lasted more than three 
days. I was writing a nightly S&P report during this uptrend, and I’m sure 
that  I  mentioned  the  bearish  implications  for  each  one  of  these  reversals. 
Although they garnered some healthy profits, their longer‐term implications 
were nil. The seventh upthrust in July 2007 looked like the big kahuna. It 
spawned a 155‐point decline and drew out massive selling. Yet in October 
2007, the S&P managed to make one final new high, and this time by a mere 
21 points. An outside downward reversal occurred on October 11, the top 
day. This high was also a 24‐point upthrust of the 2000 high, which made it 
more significant. It led to the severe down‐move to the 2009 low.

Both of the 2007 upthrusts are shown in greater detail on the weekly con-
tinuation chart of S&P futures (Figure 6.5). Upthrust 7 occurred during the 
week of July 20, 2007. here, the preceding month’s high stands out more 
clearly. But it’s the huge outpouring of supply on the sell‐off from the July 
high that dominates the chart. At that time, it was the heaviest volume in the 
history of the futures contract. remember, the heavy volume on the Silver

Wheaton (Figure 6.1) chart gave a similar bearish warning in early March 
2011 prior to its upthrust; however, its magnitude was considerably smaller 
than in the S&P. The four‐week sell‐off from the July 2007 high netted 192 
points. On upthrust number 8, the range narrowed and prices closed well 
off  the  high. These  narrow‐range  breakouts  should  always  be  eyed  suspi-
ciously. Around the 1,500 line the rally attempts were repeatedly blocked as 
the sellers had gained control.

From  the  October  2007  upthrust  high,  S&P  futures  fell  921  points  to 
the March 2009 low. This 58 percent decline would seem enough to bury 
the market, but as of this writing it has returned to within 120 points of the 
2007 high. We can tell from this recovery and many others of even greater 
magnitude  that  an  upthrust  does  not  necessarily  mean  a  permanent  high 
has been reached. Permanence, like absolute, is a word avoided in regard to 
markets. An upthrust represents ending action but not necessarily termi-
nal action. Look at the copper monthly (Figure 6.6). Its upthrust in 2008, 
above the 2006 high, looked like the end of a long‐term uptrend. Copper 
prices fell 66 percent in seven months. In February 2011, copper rallied to 
the top of its up‐channel and exceeded its previous high. Notice the clus-
tering of closes between December 2010 and February 2011. On a net ba-
sis,  this  revealed  the  market’s  inability  to  move  higher. The  upthrust  was

retested in July 2011, and record selling emerged on the August–September 
down‐move. Many other commodity markets have experienced such wide 
swings after upthrusts. Cotton, for example, peaked in 1980, and upthrust-
ed this high in 1995, but by 2011 it had reached a price twice as great as the 
1995 peak. Anything can happen. The yearly soybean oil chart (Figure 3.6) 
shows upthrusts in 1974 and 1984 above the 1947 high. Prices exploded 
above these highs in 2008 and then more dramatically in 2011 and 2012.

Nowhere  does  the  transitory  nature  of  the  upthrust  appear  more  fre-
quently than on intraday  charts. In  this environment, the  upthrust,  along 
with the spring, gives traders a great, low‐risk edge. Chapter 3 dealt with 
the  importance  of  framing  trading  ranges  with  support  and  resistance 
lines. It is around these lines that upthrusts and springs occur. They do not  
always depend on great volatility. Many times, an upthrust consists of a single  
five‐minute  bar  that  penetrates  a  resistance  line  and  reverses  downward. 
Nothing  could  be  simpler.  Figure  6.7  exemplifies  this  trading  situation. 
here, on August 5, the September 2011 S&P falls from a presession high. The 
initial low of this sell‐off is 1202.75. This price later serves as an axis line. 
Just before 13:00, the market rallies to 1210.25 and then forms a trading 
range on either side of the axis line. At 13:55, a slight new high (1212.50)

is  made  and  the  market  fails  to  follow  through.  In  this  situation,  there  is 
no heavy burst of volume signifying that the sellers have gained the upper 
hand. Instead, prices have a small reaction at first. A secondary test occurs 
at 14:40, and the low volume says demand is spent. Trades established on 
the reversal from the 13:55 high or on the secondary test (1205.75) were 
rewarded handsomely. Such small upthrusts appear every day. This reversal 
had a high probability of success because it tested the point on the chart 
where prices previously broke down. Furthermore, the low volume leading 
up to the upthrust did not reflect aggressive buying. It looked more like a 
stop hunt than the beginning of a sustained up‐move.

Figure 6.8 (S&P five‐minute chart) tells a different story. The increased 
volume on the breakout bar looks constructive; however, the narrowing of 
the range and the position of the close override the bullish interpretation. 
In this context, the increased volume reflects a large effort with a small re-
ward. The outside, downward reversal 10 minutes later adds to the bearish 
picture. But the price bars narrow on the retest of the support line and show

the selling pressure is not gathering steam. The last down‐bar at 11:25 a.m. 
holds above the low, does not attract heavy selling, and closes in mid‐range. 
All in all, this is not bearish behavior. Prudence says to close out any short 
trade. Because of the market’s volatility on this day, a quick profit could have 
been made on what turned out to be a false upthrust. The underlying bull-
ish trend was too strong to allow a larger downturn. As long as the risk is 
reasonable, however, a nimble day trader can earn a living by probing such 
potential upthrusts.

In a top formation, there may be several upthrusts before the markdown 
begins. Figure 6.9 shows an intermediate top in Freeport‐McMoran dur-
ing April 2011. A trading range formed between the first hour’s high and 
the second hour’s  low on April  25. This narrow  range  contained  most  of 
the price action over the next five trading sessions. As occurs with so many 
stocks, the heaviest volume normally appears in the first hour. When the 
heaviest hourly volume occurs in a later period, it is worth noting. I like to 
denote such aberrations in the pattern of hourly volume with a double ar-
row. On April 26, the stock makes a slight new high, but the narrowing of 
the hourly ranges and relatively low volume warn against being too bullish. 
A better attempt to break out occurs on April 28. here, the stock closes at 
its highest price and looks capable of making further gains. By the end of the

day, however, the gains are swept away. The effort to move up on April 29 
fails  to  attract  follow‐through  buying. The  heaviest  up‐volume  within  the 
trading range occurs in the first hour on May 2, a failed spring. here is an 
example of a large effort with no reward (E/r). Taken together, these two 
surges can be viewed  as secondary tests  of the April 28  upthrust.  Notice 
how the stock weakens in the last hour on May 2 and closes ominously at the 
low of the trading range. The volume in the second hour on May 3 exceeds 
the first hour’s volume and shifts the down‐move into gear. It bottomed at 
46.06 on May 17.

In  summary,  the  trend  is  of  paramount  concern  when  evaluating  up-
thrusts.  It’s  the  price/volume  behavior  on  the  preceding  and  succeeding 
bars that often reveal if a potential upthrust will actually develop. Upthrusts 
on weekly and monthly charts usually lead to larger downtrends than those 
on daily charts. On daily charts, the upthrusts at the tops of rallies may only 
produce a correction. Finally, more than one upthrust can occur in a top 
formation before the markdown gets under way. When a market continues 
to hold against a resistance level and refuses to turn down after several in-
stances of threatening price action, one has to consider absorption is taking 
place. It is the subject of the next chapter.

Absorption

107

How do we know if a test or penetration of a high will lead to a break-

out  or  a  downward  reversal? This  is  the  dilemma  we  are  constantly 
faced with: take profits or stay long and make ourselves vulnerable to giving 
back profits. The answer partly depends on one’s trading style. A short‐term 
trader, eager to book a profit, will not subject himself to any further un-
knowns. A position trader, guided by a longer‐term outlook, may choose 
to endure a correction. Traders who went long at the current price several 
weeks or even months earlier will usually opt to liquidate positions. They’ve 
had  enough.  Longs  who  bought  at  lower  levels  take  profits.  Short  sellers 
smell a possible top and put added pressure on the market. Absorption is 
the process through which the long liquidation, profit taking, and new short 
selling are overcome. It can show up on any chart, regardless of the time 
frame.

These clues point to a successful absorption of overhead selling:

 ■ Rising supports.

 ■ Volume increases around the top of the absorption area.

 ■ Lack of downward follow‐through after a threatening price bar.

 ■ At the right‐hand side of an absorption area, prices tend to press against 

the resistance line without giving ground.

 ■ In some instances, the absorption phase is resolved by a spring.

 ■ Minor up‐thrusts during absorption fail to produce a breakdown.

c07.indd   107

3/21/2013   3:07:37 PM

When  viewed  as  a  correction,  absorption  areas  are  generally  shallow. 
They often form in the area where prices recently accelerated higher and/
or where volume rose sharply.

In Figure 1.1, Where to Find Trades, absorption is shown at the top of 
the trading range. It most commonly occurs at this location on a chart. but 
absorption can occur at the bottom of a trading range as the sellers over-
come buying. At lows, the buying stems from short covering, short liquida-
tion, and bottom picking by new longs. The main characteristic of sellers 
overcoming buyers is the repeated inability of prices to rally away from the 
danger point. Such hugging of the low usually leads to a breakdown. per-
sistently  heavy  volume  hammering  against  the  low  usually  says  a  break  is 
imminent. When the persistent selling against a low fails to produce further 
weakness, Wyckoff referred to such behavior as “bag‐holding.” In this situ-
ation, the large operators are trapping the shorts. Absorption by sellers is 
made more difficult to read because some of the rally attempts look like po-
tential springs—but they either fail or are short lived. Absorption does not 
always take the form of lateral movement. There are occasions when prices 
simply levitate higher. In these instances, prices climb the proverbial “wall of 
worry,” lock out would‐be buyers waiting for a correction, and feed on any-
one daring to go short. I think of the Greek phalanx marching in step across 
the plain of Troy. Volatility usually stays low until a high‐volume wide‐range 
price bar temporarily stops the move. With that said, we will look at various 
examples of absorption plus some examples where it was negated.

on the whole, most absorption areas continue only a few days or weeks. 
Absorption on monthly charts can persist much longer. When we frame a 
trading range with support and resistance lines, the relatively tight absorp-
tion areas will stand out. Those contained within a few price bars remind me 
of a fist. In Figure 7.1, Immersion Corporation churned in a narrow range 
for four days during June 2007 and then continued higher. over the next 11 
sessions, IMMR appreciated 50 percent.

Looking at the first day of absorption (see arrow), volume soared as the 
stock reversed to close on a weak note, making the day look most threaten-
ing. It raised the specter of an upthrust. over the next two sessions, prices 
tried to rally but succumbed to close near their lows. The poor closes and 
low volumes were not encouraging; however, the lack of downward follow‐
through after the reversal day said the sellers had so far not capitalized on 
their advantage. one had to wonder why the market was holding up so well 
in the face of an “easy” shorting opportunity. on the last day, the stock pen-
etrated the lows of the previous two bars and reversed to close at its highest

level to date. This outside, upward reversal was the day to go long and place 
a protective stop below its low.

I can’t help pointing out some of the other behavior on the chart. The 
trading range in the lower left portion of the chart has a nice spring fol-
lowed by three inside days on low volume. Do you recognize the behavior 
circled at the top of this trading range? It can be viewed as absorption or as 
a pullback to test the breakout. I prefer the latter. The normal up‐channel 
is  self‐explanatory;  its  supply  line  served  as  resistance  twice. The  three 
successive highs at points 1, 2, and 3 illustrate the shortening of the up-
ward thrust.

In the original Wyckoff course (1931), absorption is first mentioned in 
his discussion of the New York Times average of 50 stocks (Figure 7.2) between 
the years 1930 and 1931. Wyckoff viewed the 13‐day trading range against 
the January 1931 high as absorption. In that situation the action consisted of 
rising supports, but price never exceeded the January high until the break-
out at the right‐hand side. besides the rising supports, we see two threaten-
ing price bars that failed to entice follow‐through selling. In the last four 
days, the closes are clustered in a one‐point range. All four closes settle be-
tween the high and midpoint of their respective ranges. The pressing against 

c07.indd   109

the resistance line leads to the breakout. Many students of Wyckoff’s course 
consider the analysis of this chart to be one of his finest writings. I learned a 
great deal from this study.

A less dramatic, but equally productive, absorption area unfolded in April 
2009 on the daily Mechel oAo chart (Figure 7.3). It does not consist of 
narrow,  lateral  movement.  Instead,  the  swings  within  the  range  are  rela-
tively wide, and they cross both side of resistance line A. I consider this to 
be absorption because the trading range worked back and forth across the 
March high. The rally from the early April low exceeded the February high 
and  reached  the  top  of  a  minor  up‐channel,  where  the  thrust  shortened. 
notice  how  the  correction  from  the  high  tested  the  vertical  area  where 
prices accelerated upward. Support formed along line D and slightly above 
resistance line b. Volumes remained about equal throughout the range, with 
the exception of the April 30 downward reversal. on this day, the down‐ 
volume rose to the highest level since the February high. The stock closed in 
a vulnerable position but failed to follow through on the next day. Here we 
have an example of bag‐holding. This immediately created a potential spring 
worthy of buying with a close stop below the low of the previous day. From 
this point, the stock rose to 12.69 on June 1.

As mentioned above, what looks like an upthrust can also be part of an 
absorption area. Figure 7.4 of the June 2012 S&p on April 25, 2012, shows 
repeated attacks against the morning high that I like to compare to a bat-
tering ram at the castle door. While there is little upward follow‐through 
on these thrusts, each pullback holds at a higher level as the buyers steadily 
push through the overhead supply. The pullbacks after each thrust become 
shallower and shallower as prices press upward. They give the best clue that 
prices will move higher. This chart demonstrates why one cannot automati-
cally consider going short when prices fail to immediately follow through 
after breakouts. It underscores why chart reading is an art rather than a sci-
ence built on black and white signals.

Distinguishing between an upthrust and absorption sometimes requires 
paying  attention  to  subtle  clues.  In  Figure  7.5,  we  see  a  daily  S&p  con-
tinuation  chart  where  prices  move  above  the  September  2009  high  and 
stop. Seven days of lateral movement follow, and they hold on top of the  
September high. It’s not an easy situation to solve. In Chapter 4, I described 
how uptrends contain numerous threatening price bars that fail to produce 
greater weakness. We see the same behavior here. Moving from left to right, 
the first arrow was preceded by an outside downward reversal. Instead of

following through on the downside, the market reverses to close on a strong 
note. but then, once more, the market reverses and closes near the day’s 
low. The third arrow points to another resurgence of buying, and the market 
has its best chance to move higher. Yet all of the gains made on this day are 
erased on the next. The volumes on the two down days are the heaviest in 
the range, which adds weight to the view that an upthrust has occurred. It 
was the market’s inability to take advantage of its two recoveries that led to 
a 60‐point sell‐off.

A small trading area around the lower boundary of a larger range often 
consists of numerous attempts to spring. When these springs repeatedly fail, 
it is fair to say the sellers are absorbing the buying. They inevitably trap trad-
ers who automatically buy any attempt to reverse upward. From its June 
2008 high, U.S. Steel (Figure 7.6) fell over $60 in about 20 days. After a 
fast rebound off the July low, support line b, the downward thrust short-
ened on the sell‐off to the August low (C). This indicated that the downward 
momentum was tiring. A smaller trading range formed around this low; it 
consisted of three attempts to spring. The third spring began after a slight 
penetration of the early August low. There was no strong burst of demand off 
the low. prices simply floated upward with small volume and narrow ranges. 
A short position was warranted once prices gapped lower on the following 
day’s opening. From this point, the stock fell $90 over the next few months.

Absorption by sellers can also be detected when prices are unable to 
rally away from the lower boundary of a trading range. Instead, they hug 
the low, and all attempts to lift off are blocked. Sometimes, this kind of 
price action will last for several weeks. It also occurs frequently on intra-
day charts. Imagine a situation opposite what we saw in Figure 7.2; when 
the  support  finally  crumbles,  expect  a  sharp  sell‐off.  Subsequent  rallies 
to test this breakdown often provide excellent shorting opportunities. In 
Chapter 1, I included the test of a breakdown among the best places to 
find trades.

Figure 7.7 shows July 2012 silver holding above a support line drawn 
across  the  March  2012  low.  on April  4,  silver  closes  $2.22  lower  and 
volume increases appropriately. The heavy volume and wide range almost 
guarantee that the March low will be shattered. over the next 11 sessions, 
prices hold within the range of April 4 and make no further downward 
progress. The largest price bar in this area occurred on April 12. It looked 
as if a spring were developing. Instead, prices erased all of this gain on the 
following day. When buyers are absorbing the sellers, upthrusts may oc-
cur, but they fail to produce a down‐move. In the case of sellers absorbing 
buyers  against  a  low,  the  springs  fail  to  materialize. not  all  11  bars  are 
narrow, but certainly the last five days fit the description. The breakdown 
from these bars begins on April 23 and leads to a $1.88 sell‐off in the next

few days. on the reflex rally to the April 27 high, the range narrows and 
volume drops sharply as the market tests the previous breakdown. prices 
have fallen below $30 on the last day and hit a low of 26.07 before the July 
contract expired.

Many Wyckoff students find absorption the most difficult behavior to rec-
ognize. The similarity between absorption and a top or bottom formation 
causes most of the confusion. In Studies in Tape Reading, Wyckoff wrote that 
absorption and distribution represent one of the “opposing forces that are 
constantly operating in the market.”1 I can find no detailed description by 
Wyckoff on the subject. It is mentioned in regard to the price action shown 
in Figure 7.2. Certainly, he knew about the tendency for rising supports and 
expanding volume on up‐swings as well as a market’s tendency to hug its 
lows when the sellers are absorbing the buyers. The other clues I discussed 
in  this  chapter  are  my  own  observations. Among  these,  the  failure  to  re-
spond to threatening price action at highs and failed springs at lows are the 
best indications of absorption.

Chart Studies

117

These  chart  studies  incorporate  much  of  the  technical  behavior  we’ve 

already discussed. Some new material is also included. Instead of fo-
cusing individually on absorption or springs, let’s put it all together. This is 
how I teach traders my methods. A chart is presented and a question posed: 
“Would you go long or go short?” When teaching, I have to present situa-
tions where something is indeed about to happen. To keep the work honest, 
some chart situations are not at a point of resolution. This is best, for we 
don’t learn from certainty. Kenko, a fourteenth‐century priest and author 
of Essays in Idleness, struck at the heart of the matter when he said, “The most 
precious thing in life is its uncertainty.” Think about it and also the place 
where certainty reigns.

In  Figure  8.1  of  Louisiana  Pacific,  the  important  support/resistance 
lines  give  us  a  framework  for  viewing  the  struggle  between  the  buyers 
and sellers. The stock made a low at 4.97 on October 30, 2009, and ral-
lied to 6.75 on November 11. After a brief pullback, prices retested 6.75 
on  day  1,  where  our  study  begins. The  minor  sell‐off  in  the  middle  of 
December held well above the October low. Day 12 tells a bullish story: 
outside upward reversal, price closed near the top of the day’s range, it’s 
the strongest close in eight sessions, and volume expanded sharply. The 
entire advance from day 12 to day 15 displays ease of upward movement 
and aggressive buying—demand has overcome supply. The buyers are in 
control. On the move to the high of day 18, however, the volume and daily 
ranges contract. This says demand has grown tired and the stock is ready 
for a correction.

A  resistance  line  is  drawn  across  the  high  of  day  18  and  a  support 
line  three  days  later. The  decline  from  day  18  to  day  21  is  a  test  of 
the  high‐volume  breakout. Additional  tests  occurred  on  days  24,  39, 
and  45.  Springs  followed  the  turnaround  after  the  low  of  day  24  and  
39, but the gains were short lived. Absorption occurred between days 
27 and 31, where prices tended to press against the resistance line until 
they gapped above it on day 32. But the up‐move was short lived. The 
high‐volume  and  outside  range  on  day  33  warned  of  climactic  action. 
Aggressive selling hit the stock on the next day, and the stock returned 
to the area between the high of day 1 and the low of day 21. Notice how 
both lines come within the vertical price range of day 15. From the low 
of  day  39,  the  stock  rallied  for  three  days  and  suddenly  turned  down 
without any warning.

Short‐term trades could have been made on several of these price swings 
but the most apparent trading situation developed after the low of day 45. 
here, for the first time, price dipped below the support line and reversed 
to close above the line and higher than the previous day’s close. The volume 
on day 45 was much lower than the penetrations on day 24 and 39 leading 
one to believe the selling pressure is dwindling. After the poor performance 
on day 46, another pullback seems likely. Instead, price holds the next day. 
If this chart study ended with day 47, we would note the lack of downward  
follow‐through  and  consider  the  spring  has  been  tested. A  long  position 
would have been warranted with a protective sell stop slightly below 6.75.
As it turned out, the trade took more time to develop. Look at the price 
action over the next three sessions. On each day (48 through 50), the stock 
moved below the support line, tested the low of day 45, and recovered to 
close on a firm note. The clustering of the three closes at the same price 
underscores  the  stock’s  buoyancy  and  reveals  the  presence  of  underly-
ing demand. This is the perfect place to go long. The stock gaps higher on  
day 51 and then has two inside days. Volume soars on day 53 as the buyer’s 
rev their engines.

This chart study was chosen because it embodies one of my favorite set-
ups: a spring on a pullback to test a breakout. This one begins with a high‐
volume,  accelerated  breakout  (12  through  15)  above  a  line  of  resistance. 
From the initial high of the breakout (18), price corrects into the vertical 
breakout area where demand overcame supply and a new line (21) of sup-
port develops. At some point, a spring (45) of this support line may occur. If 
prices have tightened—as they did here between 45 and 50—the odds favor 
a bullish turnaround.

In Figure 8.2 of Arch Coal, we see what appears to be another pullback 
(15) to test a high‐volume vertical area (1). ultimately, the stock did have 
a final spring below day 15 that produced a larger rally. But this study deals 
with reading price bars; special attention is given to the inferences we can 
draw  from  the  opening  price  in  relation  to  the  high,  low,  and  close. The 
openings and lows on day 1 through 3 coincided as the stock rallied vigor-
ously.  On  day  4,  however,  the  stock  opened  above  the  previous  day  and 
reversed to close near its low: the first bearish change in behavior. Volatility 
increased on day 6 as the stock opened below the previous day’s low, re-
bounded above the high of day 4 and closed below the midpoint of the range 
with a mere 12‐cent gain. After an obligatory bounce on day 7, the stock 
falls to a temporary low on day 9. The following four sessions hold within 
the range of day 9 as trading activity subsides. Day 13 opens above the highs 
of the previous three days, breaks below the low of the previous day, and 
closes lower. This outside day says to expect further weakness.

At the close of day 15, nothing bullish can be made out of the price move-
ment. The  stock  opened  down,  rallied  above  unchanged  only  to  succumb 
on the close. On the next day, price gaps higher and moves steadily upward 
to close on a strong note. One of the strongest springs occurs with an up-
ward  gap  following  a  demoralizing  breakdown  below  support. Within  the

up‐move, price repeatedly gaps lower (day 20 thru 25) but recovers to close 
near the daily highs. This persistent buoyancy tells us demand remains strong. 
The trend changes on day 27. here price opens higher, breaks the previous 
low and closes down: the first outside, downward reversal since day 13. The 
bearish picture becomes clearer after day 28 where we see the same vola-
tile price movement as on day 6. Similar behavior occurs on day 30, but, to 
make matters worse, the stock closes below the previous day’s low. On the 
next day, the stock suffers its largest sell‐off as prices plunge below the axis 
line drawn across the high of day 4. This breakdown trapped the longs who 
bought above the axis line. When the stock later recovered to test this line 
(days 35, 43, and 48), the openings were strong but the closings weak.

Day 35 stands out with its huge range and volume. It could have been either a 
sign of weakness or climactic action. As it turned out, there was little downward 
follow‐through and the stock stabilized. True to form, the higher opening on day 
36 led to a little more weakness, but this time it recovered on the close (unlike 
day 30, 31, 32, 33, and 35). On the up‐move to day 48, the rallies on day 38, 
40, and 43 fail to hold; one might infer the large operators are using strength to 
unload stock. The same can be said about day 48 but here it is more damaging 
because the rally fails along the axis line. (If I wanted to make a point‐and‐figure 
projection off this chart, it would be made from the high at 48.) The reversal 
action on day 51 sealed the bearish story.

Several sections of Wyckoff’s course dealt with u.S. Steel. he would view 
Figure  8.3  as  a  tour  de  force  of  market  behavior.  In  a  capsule,  we  see  the 
buying climax on day 47, where the volume was the heaviest in six months 
and the range stretched to its largest size since December 2008. high volume 
on the next two days signaled the presence of supply. A low‐volume, second-
ary test occurred on day 53. The next day’s drop below the low of day 53 
shows that the buyers have removed their bids. Wyckoff would point to day  
55 as the “decisive breaking of the very backbone of the advance.” Steady sup-
ply pounds prices lower on days 56, 58, 59, 60, and 61. Collectively, the last 
three days represent a selling climax, with shortening of the thrust at the end. 
The decline from the high has returned to the point where the stock shifted 
into a steeper trend in early December. The sellers are unable to keep prices 
down on day 66 after the stock falls below support. Increased volume tells 
us demand has resurfaced. Over the next three sessions, the stock trades in a 
minor three‐point range, and the rising supports point toward a bullish resolu-
tion. It comes on day 70, where the stock rises above the last five days’ highs.
Wyckoff’s main trading tools were the ticker tape (from which he made 
wave charts), point‐and‐figure charts, and, later in life, bar charts with vol-
ume. his indicator for depicting stock market activity was based on the num-
ber of inches per hour the ticker tape traveled—an ingenious idea that would 
be impractical today where an hour’s ticker tape might span the length of a 
football field. I believe Wyckoff would see the value of the tick difference in-
dicator plotted as a histogram on Figure 8.3. (Actual volume is used, not tick 
volume.) It shows the difference between the up and down volume per time 
period. Not all of the readings are meaningful, so I place greater emphasis on 
the larger readings. From day 1 to day 47, net buying dominated the advance. 
The narrow range on day 46 attracted little volume but the net up‐volume 
was the largest reading to date. I would assume this large influx of buying is 
short covering and weak longs sensing the stock is still headed higher. On 
days 48 and 49, the big jump in net down‐volume indicates the stock is meet-
ing supply; it reinforces the bearish message of the heavy total volumes. The 
higher close and surge in net up‐volume on day 53 suggest that the stock is 
ready to move higher. But the lack of follow‐through on day 54 puts the stock 
in  jeopardy.  On  day  55,  the  die  is  cast:  ease  of  downward  movement  and 
heavy volume. Day 58 has heavy volume, ease of downward movement, and 
a large increase in net down‐volume as longs flee. The selling reaches a cre-
scendo on day 59, where the volume exceeds 45 million shares. Notice here, 
too, the large net up‐volume (1.2 million shares); it says the short covering 
and new buying are greater than the long liquidation.

Only one horizontal line is drawn across the chart, and it is on one of 
these so‐called crisscross areas. The high on day 13 was tested (i.e., criss-
crossed) on days 24, 25, and 26. Support later formed along this line be-
tween  days  61  and  66.  On  day  66,  the  low  of  day  61  is  penetrated  and 
the stock reverses upward. Three days of lateral movement are resolved on 
day 70, where the stock closes above recent highs on large net up‐volume. 
equally heavy up‐volume pushes prices higher on the next day. u.S. Steel 
then returns to its January 2010 high.

I mentioned the true range in the previous study without much explana-
tion. In an uptrend, it encompasses the distance from the previous close to 
the current day’s high. Thus, the true range includes gaps. The true range in a 
downtrend spans the distance from the previous day’s close to the next bar’s 
low. I have observed how a large true range often coincides with heavy volume.  
I have previously shown how true range can serve as a proxy for volume and 
especially for markets or yield indices where no volume data are available.

Figure 8.4 of the daily sterling/yen cross‐rate illustrates the point nicely. 
Through the true‐range histogram, a thin line is drawn along the 300‐pip 
level. A range of this size or greater is used to define ease of movement.

Thirteen days have a range of 300 pips or more. Only three of these days (7, 
11, and 70) closed higher. Day 25 and 58 did not have wide ranges, but they 
play an important role in reading the chart.

Starting from day 1, we see ease of downward movement followed by 
stopping action on day 2. The position of the close on day 2 indicates buying 
emerged. The lengthening of the range on day 7 was climactic and heavy 
selling drove the rate lower on day 9. The selling pressure stopped on the 
next day and the cross‐rate rose to a slight new high on day 25 where the 
range narrowed. The weakness and lack of follow through on day 26 warned 
of an upthrust and fresh supply struck on day 27. Over the next 12 days, the 
buyers attempted to absorb through the overhead supply without success. 
Then came the sharp downturn on days 39 and 42.

The attempt to spring on day 46 faltered after the weak response on the 
next two days. These two narrow ranges with poor closes offer an ideal short-
ing opportunity. The large breakdown on day 49 must have been accompa-
nied by heavy volume. It and day 50 find support along the line drawn across 
the low of day 2. Although the action on days 49 and 50 temporarily stops the 
decline, they portend greater weakness. The daily ranges (shall we say vol-
ume) stay below 250 pips on the rebound to day 58. Now the rally has tested 
the breakdown point and shows no willingness to continue higher. ease of 
downward movement begins on day 62 and accelerates on days 64 and 66. 
Volume had to be climactic at the low of this decline. Also, the currency pair 
reached an oversold position within its downtrend. Day 70 turns the trend.

here, we have the widest range on an up‐bar since day 7.The two buy points 
were the selling climax on day 66 and the pullback on days 72 and 73.

I mentioned earlier how forex traders have no actual volume data. But 
they do have access to tick volume on intraday charts. Tick volume measures 
the number of transactions in a given time period. It does not reveal the 
number of contracts traded on each transaction; therefore, it really reflects 
trading  activity.  On  the  five‐minute  chart  of  the  sterling/yen  cross‐rate 
(Figure 8.5), I have plotted the tick volume as a line above the true‐range 
histogram. You can readily see how the peaks and valleys of the true range 
dovetail nicely with the tick volume. Below the true range, I have placed  
the net up/down volume differences. A cumulative line of these differences 
is  plotted  atop  the  bar  chart.  It  shows  the  trend  of  the  net  volume. The  
cumulative line differs from on‐balance volume, which is based on up or 
down closes.

Figure 8.5 shows the sterling/yen cross‐rate on March 8, 2010. here, 
we see a trading range during the morning resolved by an upthrust in the 
period prior to bar 1. Bar 2 is a bearish change in behavior as the range wid-
ens to 30 pips, the net down‐volume swells to –99 ticks, and the total tick 
volume equals 441. All three readings were new highs to date. Between bars 
3 and 6 there is no ability to rally, and net down‐volumes remain heavy on

the two small down‐bars. The bottom falls out on bars 8 and 9, where the 
wide ranges and heavy volume indicate that supply has overcome demand. 
Temporary support forms on bar 11. This bar’s low was penetrated on bar 
13, where we see the day’s largest tick volume (546). The big effort to take 
the market lower and the midrange close on bar 13 suggested a spring might 
occur. It failed on bar 15 against the supply line of the down‐channel, and 
the cross‐rate closed lower in each of the next six periods. The large range 
and net down volume smacked of climactic action (bar 20) near the bottom 
of the down‐channel. Demand surfaced on bar 22, where we have the larg-
est true range on an up‐bar since the decline began. This change in behavior 
provided a low‐risk buying opportunity. There are only seven up‐bars within 
the sell‐off from bar 1 to bar 22. Because the net up‐volumes on these seven 
bars were so low compared to the net down‐volumes, the cumulative net 
volume  trended  in  lock  step  with  price. As  a  point  of  interest,  March  8, 
2010, corresponds to bar 71 in Figure 8.4.

Tape Reading 
Part I

127

In his autobiography, Wyckoff tells the story of how he began studying the 

tape. He had observed some of the largest traders of the day sitting alone 
in their offices silently reading the ticker tape. He realized that the secret 
door to success lies in learning this technique. He concluded this discussion 
by saying, “In consideration of those who believe that tape reading is an ob-
solete practice, I affirm that knowledge of it is the most valuable equipment 
a Wall Street trader can possess.”1 He added, “If I were beginning my Wall 
Street career now, and knew what forty years of it have taught me, I should 
apply myself first of all to this business of judging and forecasting the stock 
market by its own action.”2 For purposes of tape reading, Wyckoff devised a 
wave chart and special point‐and‐figure charts that included volume. It’s no 
coincidence that the first chapter in the Wyckoff course that discusses charts 
is entitled “Buying and Selling Waves.” In the beginning of this chapter, he 
tells the student to hereafter “think in waves.”

I  have  never  watched  the  flow  of  orders  on  a  ticker  tape.  In  my  first 
two years in the futures business, all of the charts were handmade. Intraday 
charting  involved  maintaining  a  point‐and‐figure  chart  or  constructing 
an  hourly  chart  from  the  price  changes  on  a  wall‐size  quote  board  with

1968), 178.

moveable parts. We phoned the exchange floor and someone read the hourly 
volumes off a chalkboard where all price data were posted. The nature of my 
work has kept me in front of the market for 42 years.

Buyers and sellers are locked in a perpetual struggle for dominance. Buying 
waves are followed by selling waves in a seesaw battle until one side gains the 
upper hand. It can be compared to an arm‐wrestling contest in which one per-
son attempts to overcome the force—the “pulling power”—of the other. If we 
could attach electrodes to the combatants’ arms and view physiological read-
ings on blood pressure, sodium levels, cholesterol, and the like, we could look 
for the subtle signs of strength that telegraph when one side is gaining the upper 
hand. It is the same in tape reading. We judge the amount of effort (i.e., vol-
ume), the reward for that effort, the ease of movement, and so on to determine 
when short‐term and intermediate changes in trend are about to occur. Intra-
day charts are best suited for finding short‐term trend reversals. The trick is to 
use intraday charts with the most accurate picture of price/volume behavior.

In the early days of Wall Street, all intraday information was transmitted on 
the ticker tape. Point-and‐figure charts were popular among technical traders. 
If one plotted every  1
8‐point fluctuation in a stock, an entire day’s price action 
could be reproduced. Solely from a point‐and‐figure chart, one can recognize 
levels of support and resistance, draw trend lines and channels, and make price 
projections. While this is useful information, it is volume that tells a logical 
story of what is taking place in a market and alerts one when it is at a turn-
ing point. Humphrey Neill aptly wrote in 1931: “Tape interpretation depends 
upon consideration of the action of the volume . . . . The action of the volume 
tells us of the supply and demand; price merely denotes the value of the vol-
ume.”3 For a more accurate picture of intraday price action in a single stock, 
Richard Wyckoff devised a volume figure chart. a crude sketch of the volume 
figure chart first appeared in Studies in Tape Reading.4 Years later, Wyckoff wrote 
a course on tape reading where the volume figure chart (renamed the tape 
reading chart) was discussed in detail. Since the construction of my own wave 
chart, called the Weis Wave, is an outgrowth of Wyckoff’s tape reading chart, 
it makes for an appropriate starting point.

Figure  9.1  is  a  remake  of Wyckoff’s  volume‐figure  chart  showing  all  the 
movement in aT&T on June 2, 1932. It was included in his original tape reading 
course, which is still available (but modified) from the Stock Market Institute

in Phoenix, arizona. We immediately notice the absence of the x’s and o’s that 
normally comprise a point‐and‐figure chart. In their place are numbers repre-
senting the hundreds of shares traded on every  1
8  ‐point fluctuation. Whenever 
consecutive trades occurred at the same price, Wyckoff totaled the volume. We 
see that aT&T closed on June 1 at 85 1
8 , where volume totaled 2,300 shares. 
The closing price, like the next day’s opening price, is circled for reference. On 
June 2, the stock gapped down to 84 1
4  on 3,100 shares. Zeroes between 85 and 
84 3
8 show where no trades occurred. The next trades unfolded as follows: 400 
@ 84 1
8 . The first uptick is to 84 on 300 shares. 
It is followed by a downtick to 83 7
8   on 100 shares. Notice that the latter trade is 
not plotted in a separate column. Instead, it is plotted below the previous trade, 
thus creating an uptick and a downtick in the same column. This was one of 
Wyckoff’s innovations. No column can contain a single number, “x,” or “o.” This 
is the unique feature of a point‐and‐figure chart, where the box size and reversal 
unit are the same (i.e., a one‐to‐one ratio). a 1 × 2, 1 × 3, 1 × 6, 2 × 8, 2 × 6, 
5 × 15, 100 × 300, or any combination in which the reversal is larger than the 
box size, will always have more than one plot per column.

p.m. on June 1, the stock has had two small areas of lateral movement. The first 
formed around the 85 level. When prices broke below this low on the June 2 
opening, the downtrend accelerated. The second trading range formed along 
and above the 83 1
4 line. We cannot help noticing that so far the stock has made 
only slight downward progress on the break below 83 1
4. The next up‐wave

rally of the day. The sellers do not retreat as a total of 1,100 shares trade on the 
next two downticks. after 300 @ 83 1
8, another 700 shares (300 and 400 shares 
consecutively) trade on the retest of the day’s low. On the final test of the lows, 
only 400 shares trade. We might infer that the selling pressure is diminishing. 
a bullish change in behavior occurs on the next uptick as 1,700 shares (the 
largest up‐volume on the chart) trade at 83. The ensuing rally meets resistance 
at 83 1
8. On the next down‐move, 
aT&T drops a quarter‐point on a total of 1,300 shares. Here, we have a large 
effort with no reward. With the market seemingly on the ropes, the stock 
flutters upward to 83 3
8 on combined volume of 400 shares, erasing all of the 
previous down‐move.

after the stock rallied to 83 3

evidence  mounts  for  a  trend  reversal:  the  slight  progress  below  the 
second congestion area indicates that the downward momentum is less-
ening;  the  lower  volume  on  the  last  test  of  the  low  suggests  the  sell-
ing  pressure  is  tiring;  the  large  increase  in  volume  (1,700  shares)  that 
emerged  on  an  uptick  reveals  the  presence  of  demand;  the  final  break 
to  83  failed  to  attract  new  selling,  and  the  effortless  rally  off  the  low 
said the selling is spent. after the last test of 82 7
8  and subsequent rally to 
83 1
4 , Wyckoff, in his reading of this chart, said to lower stops on any short 
position to 83 3
4  and place a buy stop at the same price in order to go long. 
His protective sell stop was placed at 82 5
8 , one quarter‐point below the 
day’s low. He noted the combined 6,300 shares that traded along the 83 
and 82 7
8  lines and the stock’s unwillingness to give ground after the two 
tests of the low. Once the stock rallied to 83 1
4 , the bundle of 6,300 shares 
was viewed as potential accumulation in the context of one day’s trading.
8, the next 18 price changes are confined to a 
narrow range. The unwillingness of the stock to move lower indicates it is on 
2 and continues 
the springboard for a larger up‐wave. It begins with 1,200 @ 83 1
without interruption until reaching 84. a total of 4,500 shares are taken on this 
breakout. The ease of upward movement accompanied by an increase in volume 
is a sign of strength that begins the markup from a base area. Because Wyckoff’s 
tape reading chart is constructed like a point‐and‐figure chart, it can be used 
for making price projections. as with any point‐and‐figure chart, one counts 
the number of boxes or trades plotted along a line of congestion and multiplies 
the total by the reversal unit. The aT&T chart is  1
8 ×  1
8; therefore, the number 
of boxes is multiplied by  1
8. (With a 1 × 3 point‐and‐figure chart, the length of 
the congestion area is multiplied by 3.) Counting from right to left and from the 
last downtick (400 shares) on the 83 3
8 = 3; 3 + 
83 3
8. Point‐and‐figure counts are purely mechanical and have no magical 
powers. Sometimes they have pinpoint accuracy, and other times they fail miser-
ably. No trade should be established solely because of point‐and‐figure counts. 
They represent potential. Congestion areas on point‐and‐figure charts theoreti-
cally depict the amount of cause or preparation that has been built for a potential 
move. When point‐and‐figure counts are fulfilled, a day trader or swing trader 
may want to adjust protective stops, take partial profits, or simply become more 
vigilant for signs of ending action.

after  the  breakout  to  84,  there  is  active  pumping  action  as  1,200 
shares  trade  on  the  decline  to  83 3
4 ,  700  on  the  rebound  to  84,  and 
800 on the dip to 83 7

most of their earlier loss, and new shorts selling against the opening high 
in hope of another downswing. That the stock gives little ground in the 
face of this selling says the buyers are absorbing the supply around the 84 
level. The next upswing carries the stock to 84 3
8  on combined volume of 
1,600 shares. another shallow correction ensues before it ends with 100 
shares at 84 1
8 —the first downtick on 100 shares since the stock moved 
off the 83 3
8  congestion line. It reflects a lack of selling pressure. The sell-
ers raise their offerings from 84 1
8  to 84 1
2 , where 600 shares are bought. 
One  hundred  shares  are  bought  at  84 5
8   prior  to  a  downtick  to  84 1
2   on 
1,100 shares. The latter transaction catches the tape reader’s attention, as 
it draws out the most amount of selling since shortly after the opening. It 
warns that the stock is beginning to encounter supply. The supply may be 
profit taking by longs; we don’t know. The stock rallies to 84 3
4  on a meager 
300 shares. a shortening of the upward progress and dwindling of upside 
volume say demand is tiring. The tape reader raises stops to 83 3
8 . There is 
, but demand remains weak on the 
no supply on the quick break to 84 1

next rally (100 shares @ 84 5
8 ). Then renewed supply emerges as the stock 
drops to 84 1
8 ‐point uptick is fol-
lowed by another 1,700 shares on the decline to 84, but there is little re-
ward for the effort and we infer that buying is present. The next rally from 
84 to 84 1
2  on 1,900 shares says demand is growing. On the ensuing down-
swing to 84, the combined volume is 2,200 shares. The lack of downward 
follow‐through  attests  to  the  presence  of  demand  once  more. We  have 
seen on earlier chart studies how prices often pull back to test previous 
high‐volume areas where demand overcame supply (i.e., the rally from 83
3
8  to 84) or where the buyers absorbed through overhead supply. after the 
effervescent rally from 84 to 84 3
8 , only 100 shares trade on the decline to 
84 1
4 . The force of the selling is exhausted—once again the stock is poised 
to rally. (“anyone who can spot these points has much to win and little to 
lose.”) additional shares could be purchased on the uptick to 84 3
8 and all 
stops raised to 83 3
4 . In fairness to Wyckoff, he made no reference to adding 
shares, nor did he discuss the point‐and‐figure counts.

The  stock  has  a  vertical  run  to  85 1

line  from  the  last  low  at  83 3
8   to  the  latest  low  at  84. a  parallel  line  is 
drawn across the intervening high at 84 3

has  driven  prices  beyond  the  supply  line  of  the  up‐channel,  creating  an 
overbought condition. The stock ignores the channel and continues high-
er  after  a  minor  sell‐off  to  85. This  upswing  reaches  85 1

volume of 1,600 shares. Demand slackens slightly, but there is no sign of 
supply. There is no pressure on the downtick to 85 3
8 . But demand is obvi-
ously tired on the next upswing: 100 @ 85 5
4 . The stock 
drops  1
4  point on combined volume of 800 shares as the sellers flex their 
muscle. Fresh buy orders for 1,500 shares produce a retest of the high, but 
there is no reward for the effort. The minor support around the 85 3
8  line 
quickly gives way as the stock slips to 85  1
8  on 1,000 shares. a two‐way 
struggle develops as the buyers attempt to absorb the selling. It ends with 
a last‐gasp purchase of 300 shares at 85 5
8  points 
to 84 1
2 . about this sell‐off, Wyckoff wrote one line: “Pressure on the de-
cline is neither light nor heavy; it is a normal reaction.” He considers the 
decline “normal” because it does not retrace 50 percent or more of the 
advance  from  82 7
8 .  But  it  comes  close.  a  point‐and‐figure  count  can 
8  line for a decline to 84 3
be made across the seven plots along the 85 5
4 ; 
however, it is slightly exceeded. The decline stops along the demand line 
of the up‐channel. In addition, support forms on top of the previous re-
sistance area between 84 3
8  and within the vertical price rise. In 
a  statement  reminiscent  of  profile  analysis, Wyckoff  described  the  tape 
reading chart as “particularly valuable in showing the quantity of stock at 
various levels.” The total number of shares traded above 85 3
8  is 8,300. If 
the 6,300 shares traded between 83 and 82 7
8  could be viewed as minor ac-
cumulation, the heavy volume above 8,300 can be considered to be distri-
bution. In light of this stopping action plus the overbought position of the 
stock within the up‐channel, profits on the second purchase at 84 3
8  should 
be taken after the last‐gasp rally to 85 5

liftoff accelerated, we would raise the stop on the original purchase to

4 . We would also broaden the up‐channel by drawing a parallel line 
across  the  85 3
2 ,  an  overbought  condition  already  ex-
ists. The steep angle of advance, the combined volume of 5,200 shares 
on this vertical up‐move, and the overbought condition spell climactic 
action. (Notice that 2,300 of the 5,200 volume occurred above 86, sug-
gesting that the stock was beginning to encounter selling.) If the long 
position is not immediately closed out, stops should be raised to 85 5
8 , 
just  below  the  previous  high  at  85 3
4 .  Next,  the  stock  drops  to  86  on 
sales of 600, 700 and 200 shares. Look carefully at the character of the 
final up‐wave to 86 7
8 . The combined volume of 4,400 shares is rewarded 
with only a  3
8 ‐point gain. When the upward thrust shortens and volume

er situation not visible on the chart provided here, trades established at 
83 3
8  should be closed out. Wyckoff noted in his commentary that 10,000 
shares  traded  at  86 1
8 . Volume 
increases  as  traders  even  up  their  positions  on  the  close,  but  there  is 
little  downward  progress. The  shallowness  of  the  correction  testified 
that the buyers absorbed the fresh supply, and the stock rallied to 89 1

on June 3.

2   and  above  before  the  correction  to  86 1

Wyckoff’s  volume‐figure  chart  was  used  to  read  the  intraday  flow  of 
orders  into  an  individual  stock. To  follow  the  broader  market, Wyckoff 
plotted an intraday wave chart of five leading stocks taken from separate 
groups. He calculated the aggregate price of these stocks as they ebbed 
and flowed throughout a trading session. The resulting wave chart broke 
each  day  into  separate  buying  and  selling  waves. Wyckoff  compared  the 
length,  duration,  volume,  and  activity  on  these  waves  to  determine  the 
dominant trend and to locate the early clues that pointed to a change in 
trend. The  same  behavior  we  observed  on  the  volume‐figure  chart  can 
be  found  on  the  wave  chart.  One  can  see  shortening  of  the  upward  or 
downward  thrust,  ease  of  movement,  stopping  volume,  the  interaction 
with trend lines and support/resistance lines, and so on. While Wyckoff’s 
wave  chart  of  market  leaders  (today  it  is  known  as  the Wyckoff Wave) 
is still maintained by the Stock Market Institute, it has undergone many 
changes over the years. With the advent of stock index futures, however, 
the need for a wave chart of market leaders seems less compelling. But a 
wave chart can be useful in the study of individual stocks or futures. In 
his  tape  reading  course, Wyckoff  recommended  keeping  wave  charts  of 
individual stocks, although I cannot find an example in any of his published 
writings. as will be shown, a wave chart of a single stock or futures con-
tract can be constructed from every price change. as I experimented with 
volume‐figure  charts  (or  tape  reading  charts),  a  method  for  converting 
the information into waves evolved.

There is no difference between a wave chart and a volume‐figure chart 
whenever  the  price  scale  equals  the  minimum  fluctuation  of  a  market. 
When I first experimented with the idea of making a wave chart, I con-
verted Wyckoff’s  volume  figure  chart  of aT&T  into  a  continuous  line. 
This removed the ambiguity of having an uptick and a downtick in the 
same column. More important, it allowed me to total the volume on the 
swings  larger  than  1
8   point  and  thus  provide  a  better  picture  of  where 
the stock encountered supply and demand. One drawback, however, is

this modification increases the size of the chart. For a modern‐day mar-
ket, with thousands of intraday price changes, such a chart would be im-
practical. My final rendition is presented in Figure 9.2, where the high‐
volume  areas  are  vividly  apparent.  I  immediately  decided  that  some  of 
the data should be filtered. The easiest way to filter data is to increase the 
size of a minimum wave. I modified the volume‐figure chart into a wave 
chart with a  1
4 ‐point wave or reversal. This filters out 
all of the  1
8 ‐point reactions within a wave, removes having an uptick and 
downtick in the same column and reduces the size of the chart. It works 
just like a  1
8  and the 
reversal is  1

8  ×  1
4 . This makes the information clearer.

With the aid of this chart, the story jumps out at us. First, we see the 
2,800 shares on the test of the day’s low where the large effort yields no 
downward follow‐through. The next two rallies on 2700 and 2,800 shares 
speak of aggressive buying. The 5,800 shares on the breakout to 84 starts 
the mark‐up. Later, after the 4200 share sell‐off to 84, the selling pressure is

half  as  large  on  the  2200  retest.  On  the  next  up‐wave  to  85 3
4 ,  the  up‐
volume  (1900)  drops  to  the  lowest  level  since  the  markup  began. This 
warns of an impending downturn. Three waves later, on the rise to 85 5
8 , 
the larger 2,900 volume shows a large buying effort with no reward. It, 
too,  indicates  that  a  sell‐off  is  imminent. although  this  chart  was  made 
from 1932 price/volume data, the behavior has not changed over the past  
80 years. It’s truly fascinating to see the same action recurring over and over 
on these charts. although I was once ridiculed for saying this, I compare the 
beauty of this repetitive behavior to sunrises and sunsets. In Chapter 11,  
all of the behavior we have discussed here will appear on stock, futures, 
and  forex  charts. While  some  of  the  subtler  information  on Wyckoff’s  
8  × 1
1
8 volume‐figure chart may be missing here, one adept at reading price/
volume  behavior  would  have  no  difficulty  interpreting  and  trading  from 
Figure 9.2.

as we have seen, Wyckoff’s volume figure chart was constructed from 
every transaction. In the 1990s, trade‐by‐trade volume data were not avail-
able on bond futures. as a result, we used tick volume, and the numbers 
were very small. In order to assign a volume per trade, I decided to consider 
every “trade” during the day as the close at the end of each one‐minute time 
period. This limited the data surveyed for constructing the chart (day ses-
sion only) to 400 price changes (i.e., 400 minutes per day), and, more im-
portant, it provided a volume reading for each price change. I then created a 
data sheet listing the 400 minutes within each trading session. Whenever the 
same price occurred consecutively, I totaled the volume. If one constructs 
a volume‐figure chart from one‐minute closing prices and no consecutive 
closings occur at the same price, it is conceivable 400 data points will appear 
in one session. While statistically possible, it never occurred.

Figure  9.3  is  an  example  of  a  1

32  ×  1
32  tape  reading  chart  constructed 
from one‐minute closings. Since it has a 1:1 ratio between the scale and the  
reversal,  an  up‐tick  and  down‐tick  can  occur  in  the  same  column  as  on  
Figure 9.1. The following list (tape) itemizes the price changes on November  
29,  1993,  in  the  December  1993  bond  contract  between  7:20  a.m.  and 
8:48 a.m. CST. On the previous day, the contract closed at 11603.

7:20 11612‐6: The contract gaps higher from 11603 to 11612. Since the 
opening price continues an up‐move from the previous day, we plot 
zeroes within the same column to reflect the gap.

7:21 11611‐11: We plot this downtick in the next chart column.

7:23  11613‐12: We  enter  the  plots  only  after  a  price  change  occurs, 
for  there  may  be  consecutive  one‐minute  closes  at  the  same  price. 
When this occurs, plot the total volume. enter the volume (22) above 
the  previous  plot  at  11611.  Remember,  there  must  be  at  least  two  
numbers in a column. Since we have only one downtick to 11611 in 
this column, enter the uptick to 11613 above it.

7:24 11614‐11
7:25 11614‐10
7:26 11612‐10: after this price change, we enter the 21 ticks at 11614 
above the 22 ticks at 11613. In 1993, anyone familiar with intraday 
bond  volume  would  view  the  sharp  increase  over  the  previous  four 
minutes  as  evidence  the  opening  rally  has  run  its  course. The  large 
buying effort netted only  1

32 nd above the opening high.

7:27 11613‐9; 7:28 11612‐7; 7:29:11611‐7; 7:30 11612‐5: Since the high 
at 11614, the volume on the two upticks (see underlined times) dimin-
ished to 9 and 5, respectively. a tape reader would notice the weaker 
demand on these upticks, which indicates that the sell‐off has not ended.

7:37 1610‐3; 7:38 11610‐4; 7:39 11610‐2 [total 9]: Trading activity has 

slowed down after the decline to 11609.

7:40 11612‐4
7:41 11609‐6
7:42  11610‐1: The  11609  line  has  been  tested  twice.  In  real  time,  we 
would  draw  a  support  line  across  the  11609  level. Volume  remains 
light, thus suggesting that the selling pressure is dwindling. a minor 
downtrend line drawn from 11614 across the top of the last uptick to 
11612 creates a wedge or apex. The narrowing of price swings into 
such a pattern warns that the stalemate will be resolved soon.

7:43 11608‐6; 7:44 11608‐6 [total 12]: December bonds penetrate the 
11609 support level, momentarily shifting the advantage to the sellers. 
The sell‐off from the 11614 high to 11608 has taken 24 minutes. Watch 
the action in the next five minutes.

7:45 11611‐5; 7:46 11612‐7; 7:47 11613‐5; 7:48 11614‐5; 7:49 11616‐8: 
No downward follow‐through as prices take big steps upward to a new 
high. The easy upward movement signals a bullish change in behavior, 
and the tape reader buys bonds. Protective sell stops are placed at 11607.

Following the rise to 11616, bonds hold above the previous high at 11614 
without giving anyone an opportunity to buy cheaply. The rally continues in 
stair‐step fashion. a burst of volume (21 ticks) temporarily stops the advance 
at 11621. The first effort to push above 11624 is thwarted because longs typi-
cally take profits around the quarter‐point increments. Once the profit taking 
is absorbed, prices rise from 11621 to 11630 (8:21 to 8:31) with only one 
downtick. The market’s proximity to 11700 entices more profit taking. Bonds 
have almost rallied to the top of the up‐channel drawn from the low of the pre-
vious correction. In addition, most of the point‐and‐figure projection across 
the 11527 line has been fulfilled. Yet we see no evidence of supply overcoming 
demand. Now let’s read the tape from the 8:31 high at 11630:

8:32 11628‐4; 8:33 11627‐3: This low‐volume correction reflects no ag-

gressive selling.

8:34 11628‐7; 8:35 11628‐8; 8:36 11628‐4; 8:37 11628‐8; 8:38 11628‐6: 
The market trades for five minutes and gains only  1
32nd despite the day’s

volume of 60: a small reward for the large effort. This up‐wave spans  4
32
nds but only gains  1
32nd above the previous high. The volume is greater 
than on the rally from 11608 to 11616 and on the up‐wave from 11621 
to 11627. The lack of upward progress in the face of such a large effort 
tells us the bond market has encountered supply. We either raise the sell‐
stop to 11628 on the long position or close out the trade immediately. 
Now comes the first evidence that the sellers are overcoming the buyers.

[total 23]; 8:48 11628‐3: The total volume at 11629 is the largest on 
a downtick since November 28. The sell‐off from 11631 to 11628 is 
accompanied by the largest volume since the 11608 low.

a bond  1

32nd volume‐figure chart requires a data sheet of one‐minute clos-
es and volumes plus chart paper with a grid large enough to enter the volume 
numbers. anyone who has the patience to make such a chart and intensely 
study intraday price movement will learn a great deal about how markets 
work. although greatly modified, the concept behind this chart stems from 
Wyckoff’s tape reading course. Its interpretation, however, is mostly a matter 
of simple logic gained through study and observation. From a logical reading 
of the tape, one gains a sense, a feel for what will happen next.

In  Figure  9.3,  look  at  the  rise  from  the  last  low  at  11621  where  the 
volume equaled 4 ticks. From this low, bonds gained  9
32nds with only one 
downtick. The thrust shortened on the final up‐wave, and it had volume of 
60 ticks, the heaviest reading for the day. The 35‐tick volume on the next 
down‐wave was the heaviest since the spring low. It doesn’t take a rocket sci-
entist to understand the message. In Studies in Tape Reading, Wyckoff wrote:

Tape Reading is rapid‐fire horse sense. . . . The Tape Reader aims to 
make deductions from each succeeding transaction—every shift of the 
market’s kaleidoscope; to grasp a new situation, force it lightning‐like 
through  the  weighing  machine  of  the  brain,  and  to  reach  a  decision 
which will be acted upon with coolness and precision.5

To  requote  from  his  autobiography,  Wall  Street Ventures  and  Adventures, 

Wyckoff said:

The  purpose  of  the  self‐training  and  continued  application  of   
the  methods  suggested  in  Studies  in Tape  Reading  was  to  develop  an

intuitive judgment [my emphasis], which would be the natural outcome 
of spending twenty‐seven hours a week at the ticker over many months 
and years.6

The  “methods”  he  refers  to  are  examples  of  how  he  logically  read 
the  ticker  tape.  By  no  means  am  I  trying  to  slight  the  information  he 
imparts. Wyckoff knew tape reading cannot be reduced to a set of specific 
instructions. It’s like dancing. You can learn the basic dance steps, but in 
order to dance you must have the feel of the music. Wyckoff’s tape read-
ing  course  explained  the  construction  of  the  tape  reading  chart,  and  he 
showed how it could be integrated with a wave chart of market leaders. 
When Wyckoff began studying markets, there were no intraday quotes on 
the Dow or other indices. a single, closing figure at the end of each trading  
session  was  the  only  measure  of  a  day’s  performance. as  already  noted, 
Wyckoff  created  a  wave  chart  of  five  or  six  leading  stocks.  He  plotted 
the  volume  on  the  buying  and  selling  waves,  thus  making  it  very  useful 
for  judging  the  condition  of  the  overall  market.  It  is  interesting  to  note 
that Wyckoff chose to present the data as a wave chart rather than a 5‐ or  
60‐minute bar chart. a tape reader would know price movement unfolds 
in waves rather than in equal time periods.

an entire  1

32 nd volume‐figure chart of bonds is too unwieldy for show-
ing a continuum of price history. But if we change the reversal unit to  3
32
nds,  we  can  reduce  the  number  of  wave  turns  per  day.  For  example,  the 
complete  1
32 nd chart on November 29, 1993, had 258 out of a maximum 
400 waves. In Figure 9.4, the modified reversal size reduces the number of 
reversals  (let’s  call  them  waves)  to  32. This  3
32 nd  wave  chart  constructed 
from the same one‐minute closes as on Figure 9.3 tells a wonderful story. 
We see the shortening of the upward thrust and reduced volume at 11631 
(60), the emergence of supply on the down‐waves to 11627 (62) and 11626 
(119), the upthrust with weak demand on the final high at 11700 (48), the 
high‐volume break where supply overcame demand on the sell‐off to 11621 
(290), and the light‐volume secondary test on the two up‐waves to 11628 
(48)/(7). From this point, the force of the selling steadily overwhelms the 
buying  as  bonds  trend  lower  throughout  the  session. Writing  three‐digit 
volume numbers within a chart grid was impractical. The next adjustment 
came easy: plot the volume as a histogram below the corresponding price 
movement.

Figure  9.4  December 1993 Bonds Three‐Tick Tape Reading Chart

Now that we know the basic ingredients for making a wave chart, let’s 
go through the mechanics of determining the waves and their volumes and 
plotting them on the chart. For the  3
32nd wave chart, we begin with a work-
sheet referred to as a “one‐minute tape.” It is simply a tabular listing of the 
closing  price  for  each  minute  and  its  corresponding  volume. as  before, 
when no trade occurs during a time period, the slot is filled with a horizon-
tal line. We are going to examine the price movement in September 2001 
bonds on June 15, 2001. On the previous day, an up‐wave peaked at 10123 
shortly after 2 p.m. eST, and prices then declined to close at 10118. The total 
tick volume on the decline to 10118 was 160. If prices open lower on June 
15, the down‐wave from 10123 will be continued until there is a reversal 
of  3
32nds  or  more. The “tape”  of  the  first  11  minutes  on  June  15  reads  as 
follows:

at the end of the first minute, bonds were  6

nds lower at 10112. This 
is below the close on June 14, so we continue totaling the volume. The 
10 ticks in the first minute are added to the previous total of 160, for 
a  new  total  of  170. The  10112  price  at  the  end  of  the  second  minute 
is considered part of the existing down‐wave, and its volume is added 
to the previous volume for a new total of 178. The uptick to 10113 in 
the third period is not sufficient to reverse the down‐wave. a new low 
for the wave occurs in the fourth period. The volumes from the third 
and fourth periods are now added to the previous total for a new sum

of  201.  In  the  next  five  periods,  bonds  hold  in  a  narrow  range  with 
combined volume of 16 ticks. If bonds close at or above 10114 in the 
10th  period,  the  uncounted  16  ticks  would  become  part  of  the  new 
up‐volume. Instead, a drop to 10110 occurs in the 10th period, and the 
total volume increases to 228. The 08:30 period in bonds often marks 
the point where volatility increases because many government reports 
are  released  at  this  time.  Something  bullish  was  obviously  announced 
as bonds jumped  8
32nds higher to 10118. This instantly marked a change 
in  direction  and  the  new  up‐volume  is  7. a  line  is  then  drawn  across 
the  08:29  listing  where  the  previous  wave  ended. as  the  data  are  be-
ing recorded, it is useful to keep a running total. Notice that no total 
is made for those time periods where prices did not continue lower or 
trade at the existing low of the wave. These blank spaces give us some 
sense  of  the  market’s  pace. While  no  great  significance  is  attached  to 
this information, it can be useful to someone who did not observe the 
tape and wanted to gain some insight into how frenetic the selling or 
buying was at turning points within the session. The market opened on 
a weak note with a gap down, but there was no cascade of falling prices 
afterward.  In  real  time,  this  sort  of  information  becomes  part  of  the 
gestalt of reading the market. Here are the next 51 readings from the

(Figure 9.6 is plotted through 9:21.)

The up‐wave that began in the 08:30 period spanned 28 minutes. Vol-
ume  totaled  155,  and  the  market  gained  19
32nds.  Notice  the  pace  of  the 
up‐move: prices moved higher or remained at the high of the wave in 19 
of the 28 minutes. This is a robust up‐wave. We would not have known the 
up‐wave had ended until the 9:01 period where bonds dropped  3
32nds to 
10126. at that point, we would have updated our chart. The sell‐off from 
10129 lasts only 6 minutes. at 9:10, bonds trade at 10127. There are more 
trades at 10127 in the next 4 minutes. In the 11 minutes since the low 
at 10124, the market has gained  3
32nds on volume of 41—not an overly 
impressive rally. But suddenly there is a buying flurry: 10 @ 30 . . . 11 @ 
31 . . . 10 @ 00. Here are 31 ticks in 3 minutes (the heaviest 3 minutes’ 
worth of volume to this point in the day) compared to the previous 41

ticks in 11 minutes. Discussing the action at turning points, Humphrey 
Neill wrote: “The public is attracted by price changes, not by volume; that 
is to say, the public does not analyze the action of volume.” 7 Three min-
utes later, prices fall  3
32nds. We now have two up‐waves on the chart. The 
first lasted 28 minutes and gained  19
32nds on 159 volume; the second lasted 
14 minutes and gained  8
32nds on 72 volume—about 50 percent the effort 
and reward. The second up‐wave exceeded the top of the first up‐wave by 
only  3
32nds. In an uptrend, when the duration, length, and volume of the 
buying waves begin to diminish, one should be alert to a possible change 
of trend. The same is possible when the duration, size, and volume of the 
selling waves begin to increase. (This is dramatically evident at the top on 
Figure 9.4.) Unfortunately, as with most tape reading observations, this 
is not an ironclad rule. It is best thought of as a guideline. (There are in-
stances when the up‐waves in a rising market will inch along on declining 
volume because of a lack of selling. It will continue until supply emerges.) 
The  same  duality  that  brightens/darkens  every  aspect  of  our  lives  also 
exists in interpreting markets. We left off with the second buying wave of 
the day ending at 10200 and the beginning of a selling wave. although the 
diminished volume on the second buying wave and the shortening of the 
upward thrust make us wary of a possible trend change, nothing overtly 
bearish has occurred. Let’s examine more of the tape:

(Figure 9.7 is plotted to this point.)

The selling wave that began from 10200 was small and lasted only 5 minutes.  
There is nothing bearish about this behavior. But look at the next buying 
wave  of  the  day.  It  lasted  only  5  minutes  compared  with  previous  rallies 
of  28  and  14  minutes. This  up‐move  netted  3
32nds  on  a  move  to  a  lower 
high and volume diminished. The buying power is tired. a bearish change in 
behavior occurs in the next selling wave. Here the duration and volume are 
greater than on any of the down‐waves that originated during this session.

Two minutes after the low at 10124, a  3
32nd reversal occurs. Look at the pace 
of the advance from 10124 to 10129. During this 15‐minute buying wave, 
prices advance or hold the high in only three periods. Such behavior reflects 
weak demand and little interest in bonds. The market is now vulnerable to 
a larger downturn. The reversal occurs at 10:04 on the downtick to 10126. 
a  tape  reader  would  go  short  and  protect  above  10200.  Bonds  continue 
to  slide,  and  we  see  a  10121  print  on  the  tape  at  10:15. The  market  has 
now fallen through the support at 10124 where two of the last three selling 
waves had held. More of the tape action is listed next:

10:16 10122‐5
10:17 23‐5
10:18 23‐6
10:19 21‐6 89 (There has been no downward progress, but volume continues 
to build. The volume is now heavier than on the previous selling wave.)

10:21 18‐9 105
10:22 19‐3
10:23 18‐9 117
10:24 19‐11
10:25  17‐10  138  (Traders  have  placed  stops  below  the  previous  day’s 
close  at  10118—a  “pivot  point”  for  some  systems—as  the  market 
moves into negative territory for the session.)

10:27 18‐6
10:28 16‐8 156
10:29 16‐9 165
10:30 15‐7 172 (Humphrey Neill said the “market is honeycombed with 
buying and selling orders.” The whole numbers and half‐numbers are 
favorite levels where traders place orders to buy and sell. Thus, it is 
not surprising to see some hesitation caused by shorts taking profits 
and new longs buying around 10116.)

after  holding  for  11  minutes  between  10116‐10115,  the  decline  to 
10113 seemed like the beginning of more weakness. Now that the mar-
ket  is  trading  at  10115  again,  one  might  think  the  decline  is  ending.  If 
short, do you cover? Often, especially when we think too much, we can-
not tell the difference between noise and meaning. When in doubt, don’t 
get out—lower risk/increase comfort level by adjusting your stop.

10:52 05‐10 300

In the last 7 minutes, the sell‐off steepened and volume increased sharply. 
This is either the beginning of a much larger plunge or it is a stopping point 
of some unknown degree that can only be determined from a view of the 
larger  price  history.  From  the  small  amount  of  price  movement  we  have 
observed, we cannot tell if this is part of larger downtrend, a brief washout 
in an uptrend, or part of a broader trading range. If the average daily range 
in bonds is about  29
32nds, a day trader might want to take profits and wait for

Here, the market has rallied above the high of the previous two buying waves. 
a correction of some degree is under way. If one is still short, one must decide 
whether to take profits, take partial profits, or lower stops. at what level would 
you expect the market to encounter resistance? assuming Wyckoff went short 
at 10121, he probably would have taken profits at the climactic low or shortly 
after it showed a tendency to make higher highs. If he had chosen to trade the 
larger potential, he would protect just above the 50 percent retracement level. 
From our one‐minute, filtered data, we have a decline from 10200 to 10105, so 
the 50 percent level is about 10118. The actual high and low of the decline are 
10201 and 10105, making 10119 the precise 50 percent correction point. But 
is there any shelf of support within the decline where we might tuck our stop 
above? None appears on the chart but our record of the tape shows the lateral 
movement back and forth between 10116 and 10115 (10:28 to 10:44). It could 
provide resistance on any corrective rally. From our intensity of involvement 
with the tape, we have a mental picture of where to expect resistance.

a new selling wave begins with this reversal. The last buying wave gained 
7
32nds in 36 minutes on volume of 71 ticks. It failed to retrace 50 percent 
of the large decline from 10200 to 10105 and did not exceed the resistance 
between  10116  and  10115.  So  far,  this  up‐wave  looks  like  a  typical  low‐ 
volume correction in a downtrend.

The  market  died  at  10115  as  volume  dwindled  to  four  ticks  in  
6 minutes. Within the rally from 10105, the last buying wave marked the

first failure to make a higher high. With the last down‐wave attracting no 
sellers, the market was in position to move higher. Instead, the buyers dis-
appeared. It is not uncommon for trading to become listless at this time of 
day as traders in the eastern time zone depart for lunch. Do you believe the 
old adage “Never sell a dull market” is correct? Figure 9.9 ended at 12:15.

The 23 minutes in this selling wave is now longer than any of the previ-
ous selling waves since the low at 10105. It is considerably greater than the 
duration of the previous buying wave. So far, the slow pace of the decline 
suggests the market is merely drifting.

Since  the  low  at  10105,  all  reactions  have  held  at  successively  higher  
levels.  Here  is  the  first  selling  wave  to  make  a  lower  low  and  it  lasts  
nds  lost  on  this  sell‐
40  minutes.  Should  we  compare  the  mere 
off  to  the  24
32nds  lost  on  the  down‐wave  from  10129  to  10105  in 
51 minutes and therefore assume the selling pressure is abating? Or is it bet-
ter to judge this decline in context of only the rally from 10105? The answer 
is obvious: There is no connection between the two down‐waves. The first is 
the dominant feature on the chart; the second is an indication the sellers are 
again gaining the upper hand after the anemic rally from 10105.

The market has taken 32 minutes to rally  4

32nds on the same amount of 
volume  as  the  last  selling  wave.  So  far  the  market  has  failed  to  equal  the 
previous high at 10115. as shown on Figure 9.10, this buying wave now has 
ended. You can see the nine complete waves that evolved from the 10:52 low 
at 10105. I should add that all of the one‐minute periods where no trade 
occurred are omitted. a normal one‐minute bar chart would leave these pe-
riods blank; a one‐minute close‐only chart would extend a line from the last 
price through these time periods leaving long, horizontal lines throughout

the  chart. The  last  two  waves  spanned  40  and  32  minutes,  respectively. 
We remarked earlier about the minor congestion area above 10115 where 
bonds traded between  10:28 and 10:44. after this brief period of lateral 
movement,  the  downtrend  steepened  and  the  volume  increased  as  prices 
fell  10
32nds  to  10105. as  we  have  seen  on  the  bar  charts,  it  is  not  unusual 
for  corrections  to  test  areas  where  trends  accelerated  on  heavy  volume. 
Thus the rally from 10105 has returned to the level where the sellers over-
whelmed the buyers.

The market has rallied to 10105, the price level where temporary sup-
port formed after the decline from 102. Following the low at 10105, the 
first couple of selling waves held at 10108. Thus, it is best to pay attention to 
the overhead resistance between 10105 and 10108. as we know, in a down-
trend, previous support levels often act as resistance.

The  3

32 nd drop from 10108 signals a buying wave ended at 14:49. It was 
unable to break through the overhead resistance between 10105 and 10108. 
This also suggests the shortening of the thrust between the low at 10105 and 
10102 is only temporary.

at the end of the pit‐trading session, we left off with a selling wave in 
progress at 14:55 on the decline to 10104. Nothing decisive occurred in 
the  last  four  minutes. We  are  left  with  a  remaining  volume  of  50.  If  the 
market  opens  at  10104  or  lower  on  the  next  day,  these  50  ticks  will  be 
added to the volume. If the market opens at 10107 or higher on June 18, the  
50 ticks will be a part of the new up‐volume total. The volume of 50 will 
be drawn as a solid black line, and the new up‐volume will be drawn in red 
above it. Wyckoff’s wave chart of market leaders always ended with the day’s 
close, but waves really do not respect closings. By continuing waves from 

c09.indd   160

one day to the next, we get a better picture of their force as depicted by the  
cumulative volume.

On Monday June 18, bonds opened higher but then spent most of the 
session moving lower. Figure 9.12 shows the 21 waves identified on June 
19. They began with a selling wave on a gap lower. Starting from this point, 
can you identify the three waves during the June 19 session that indicated 
the near‐term trend was turning from bearish to bullish? Remember when 
the  selling  waves  begin  to  diminish  in  length  and  volume  (duration)  and 
the buying waves increase, the trend is reversing upward. Wave one spans 
32 nds, wave three equals  8
13
32 nds and exceeds the bottom of wave one. Wave 
five nets only  5
32 nds and does not make a new low which gives us the first 
bullish change in behavior. Wave six adds weight to the bullish story as bonds 
put in the largest up‐wave of the session with the heaviest up‐volume. The 
behavior on wave nine says bonds are on the springboard as here we have the 
smallest wave of the session and no selling pressure. Markup begins in wave 
10. a struggle for dominance occurs around the 101 line where the market

found initial support on June 18. The last little down‐wave below 101 had 
a total lack of selling with no ease of downward movement to complete a 
beautiful upturn. I used this point‐and‐figure format for several years; it’s 
always been one of my favorites. The next step in the evolution of the wave 
chart provided even better information and greater flexibility. It is the sub-
ject of Chapter 10.

I know a minute‐by‐minute reading of an entire day’s price movement 
seems terribly tedious. But, like Wyckoff, I can testify to the value of making 
the effort. The process detailed in this chapter increased my chart reading 
skills tenfold. and I did this for years. Despite the huge volatility in today’s 
markets and the lightning fast velocity of expectations, the behavior Wyckoff 
observed in 1909 provides a tremendous edge.

Tape Reading 
Part II

163

Another method I used for displaying the waves and wave volume simply 

involved the use of a close‐only line chart with a volume histogram. It, 
too, served me well. One missing ingredient, however, was time. Whenever 
the duration of a wave was unusually large, I noted it on the chart. Eventu-
ally,  I  found  someone  to  write  a  program  for  the  wave  chart.  No  longer 
were the waves plotted equidistantly. The space between the waves reflected 
the duration of a wave, and the width of the volume bars was also a function 
of time. From that point, I had all three elements necessary for tape reading: 
length, volume, and duration of waves. In the discussion of bonds on June 
15 and 19, 2001, I made numerous references to these three elements when 
appropriate. The tabular listing of the data made this possible. But with the 
new chart it became readily apparent at a glance. It allowed me to experi-
ment with wave charts made from any time period. Suddenly, I saw price 
waves that lasted many days, and the wave volume told a better story than 
on the hourly or daily charts. The reason is simple. Price movement does 
not unfold in bundles of equal time periods; it unfolds in waves. Wyckoff and 
early tape readers clearly understood this fact and therefore studied the al-
ternating buying and selling waves gleaned from the stock ticker. Dissecting 
price movement into time periods does not impede one’s view of the trend. 
But volume subdivided into equal chunks of time does interfere with one’s 
ability to discern the true force of the buying and the selling. In a sense, the 
message of the volume is lost in time.

To illustrate the point, Figure 10.1 of the December 2012 euro contract is 
presented here. First, though, let me explain the chart. For intraday currency 
or forex trading, I prefer a sensitive tick bar chart. I also look at time‐based 
charts, but the construction of the tick bar is not limited by a set amount of 
time. Thus, under volatile trading conditions, one 250‐tick bar may span a few 
seconds, and at other times it may last 20 minutes or more. Larger tick bar 
charts are also useful for visualizing the broader price structure. For example, 
I sometimes look at the 5,000‐tick bar for currencies or the Standard & Poor’s 
(S&P) 9000 tick bar. Figure 10.1 shows a three‐pip wave constructed from 
250‐tick bar closes on September 18, 2012. The total contract volume for 
each tick bar is also included. Starting from the left side of the chart, we first 
notice the large up‐wave with 5,400 volume. This is the heaviest up‐volume in 
about four hours. The shortening of the upward thrust on the up‐move stands 
out clearly. It says the trend is tiring. Supply appears on the first down‐wave, 
where the 4,100 volume is the largest to date. Compare this bearish change 
in behavior to wave 6 in Figure 9.12, where demand first appeared. On the 
subsequent up‐wave, the 1,100 volume signaled weak demand and offered an 
excellent entry point for selling short.

For the most part, the tick bar volume looks like the tree line on the 
horizon. We can find little differentiation between the volumes, whereas  
the  cumulative  wave  volume  shows  the  peaks  and  troughs  of  trading  
activity.  Nowhere  is  this  more  important  than  on  the  1,100‐contract  
pullback where the tick bar volume shows little change. Similarly, the 4, 
100‐contract decline from the high does not stand out as heavy volume on 
the tick‐bar histogram. Within the decline from the high, the down‐waves 
span 13, 19, 19, and 4 pips, respectively. The individual times per wave 
are 10, 16, 4, and 2 minutes. Add to this picture their diminished wave 
volume, and the turnaround from the 9:38 a.m. EDT low is obvious. One 
final  observation:  the  next  to  last  down‐wave  covered  as  much  ground  
(19 pips) as its preceding wave. Yet it lasted only 4 minutes. The speed of 
this  down‐wave  reflects  climactic  action  as  the  trapped  longs  are  stum-
bling  over  one  another  to  sell  out.  It  tells  anyone  who  is  short  to  start 
taking  profits  and/or  jamming  their  buy  stops  to  within  a  few  ticks  of 
the last print. Would‐be buyers should move to the edge of their seat in 
anticipation of a short‐covering rally. Twenty‐two minutes after the final 
low, the euro traded at 1.3077.

Figure 10.2 shows a 3‐minute chart of June 2011 Australian dollar. I have 
removed the individual 5‐minute bars. The minimum wave size, or reversal, 
is 3 pips. The minutes per wave are plotted at the wave turning points. Now 
look at the rise from 1:15 p.m. EST. We see the three up‐waves spanned 12, 
36, and 6 minutes, respectively. Their lengths are 10, 21, and 5 pips, with 
volumes of 1896, 2038, and 1305 contracts. The diminished time, length, 
and volume on the waves reveals the market’s weakening condition. They  
tell  the  tape  reader  to  take  profits  on  long  positions. Wyckoff  would  ad-
vocate taking profits and immediately going short in such a position. The 
volume histogram is cumulative. The 27‐minute down‐wave consists of nine  
3‐minute time periods and the total volume increases evenly until the ninth 
period of this wave, where it bulges. This format helps one see the spurts 
of volume that often occur at tops and bottoms of waves. For another ex-
ample, look at the volume jump in the last period of the 6‐minute up‐wave 
to the high. Within the decline from the high, all of the rallies are small and 
short lived. They can be used to add to a short position or to get aboard if 
one failed to recognize the top. The same can be said about the small, low‐
volume corrections during the preceding rally. Currency futures and cor-
responding forex markets offer a unique feature, as the 3‐pip wave size can 
be used on each one. This allows the trader to move from one to the other 
in search of the best setup without having to reconfigure the wave setting.

When trading, I often superimpose the wave chart on top of the price 
bars. This allows the trend lines, channels, and support/resistance lines to 
be drawn from the precise highs and lows. Lines drawn on a chart like the 
Australian dollar, where the price bars are hidden, still work well. I always 
like to filter as much data as possible. This way much of the intraday distrac-
tion and ambiguity is removed. Because intraday price bars can give mixed 
messages, their removal makes it easier to hold a position that might oth-
erwise be closed out prematurely—an affliction suffered by many traders.

Figure 10.3 shows all the important lines on the May 2011 NY copper 
wave chart. It is constructed from 5‐minute closes and uses a 0.0025 re-
versal. The  minimum  tick  in  copper  is  0.0005  valued  at  $12.50. Thus,  a 
1‐cent move from 4.38 to 4.39, equals $250. The chart provides a tour de 
force  of  wave  analysis. Wave  time  and  volume  are  plotted  at  the  turning 
points. Starting from the 8:40 a.m. EST low, copper rallies over 2.5 cents in 
35 minutes. Next, we see seven waves of lateral movement in which the 
volume diminishes. Notice the fifth wave where the market slips 1.40 cents 
on rounded volume of 300 contracts. The next down‐wave spans 0.60 cents 
on volume of 200 contracts. The two waves span 5 minutes and 10 minutes, 
respectively. Many times a 10‐minute wave will have larger volume than a 
5‐minute wave when they occur consecutively. The small volume and size of 

c10.indd   166

the latter tell us May copper is on the springboard, an ideal place to go long. 
The following up‐wave runs 2.65 cents in 55 minutes and speaks of strong 
demand. No supply appears on the 10‐minute reaction. The next up‐wave 
gains another 1.25 cents in only 25 minutes, but volume falls sharply. It is 
the first sign of weakening demand. From this point, the action of the sellers 
begins to dominate the chart.

After two small waves, down and up, an overtly bearish change in behav-
ior occurs. Copper has a shallow decline but it lasts 30 minutes, the most 
downtime since the 8:40 a.m. low. It is also the largest sell‐off since copper 
lifted off the springboard. Now the market has a fast rally above the previ-
ous  high.  In  the  third  5‐minute  bar  of  this  rally,  the  wave  volume  triples 
and prices close well off the high—a potential upthrust. The next down‐
wave extends slightly below the low of the previous sell‐off; it is larger and 
spans another 30 minutes. The change in trend has become obvious. Prices 
now creep a mere 0.30 cents higher over the next 45 minutes underscoring 
the total lack of demand. (Wyckoff described this as a springboard position 
prior to markdown.)The low angle of advance on this last up‐wave shows 
how much difficulty copper had on this rally. Such information was not as 
apparent on the tape reading charts. From the April 21 high, copper prices 
fell 40 cents over the next nine sessions.

Figure 10.4 presents a 0.50‐point wave atop a 5‐minute chart of the June 
2011 S&P contract on May 6, 2011. It shows the kind of trading turn that 
one sees every day. For the S&P, wave volumes are noted in thousands of 
contracts.  Here  we  see  a  resistance  line  at  1349.50,  which  is  penetrated 
a  few  hours  later. The  volume  reaches  the  highest  level  for  any  previous 
up‐wave and the S&P appears at the beginning of a larger rally. Anyone who 
trades the S&P regularly knows to be on guard for a whipsaw whenever a 
new high or low is made. It’s the nature of the beast. The reaction off this 
high draws out the heaviest volume in the last five down–waves, but it’s not 
overt. Its modest size makes it seem less threatening. But the next up‐wave 
speaks to us: no ease of upward movement, no demand, potential upthrust 
on previous up‐wave, and the risk to the previous high is only 0.75 points 
or $37.50 per contract. You can’t ask for anything better. A short can be en-
tered as soon as the wave shows a 0.50‐point reversal. Twenty‐five minutes 
later, the S&P traded 7.25 points lower. By 2:40 p.m., it had fallen another 
11 points—all this from a subtle change in behavior.

It’s the volume that makes wave charts valuable. As mentioned earlier, 
time‐based volume often fails to reveal the true force of buying and selling. 
Nowhere is this more evident than with daily volume, where the readings 
look about the same. It is particularly true of daily stock volume. The waves 
(minimum size of 10 cents) on the U.S. Steel daily chart (Figure 10.5) tell 
a typical story. I have included the daily volume so it can be compared with 
the clarity of the wave volume. The sell‐off in October 2010 consists of two 

c10.indd   168

large down‐waves with volumes of 56 and 64 million shares each. On the 
day before the second wave ended, the actual volume rose to 19 million, the 
largest on the chart. Following the low on October 27, price closed higher 
for seven consecutive days on total volume of 91 million shares, the heaviest 
up‐volume since early March. Actual volume for the same period does not 
stand out and looks very much like the readings in early October. While the 
wave volume looked climactic at the October low, there was no low‐volume 
pullback  to  enter  a  long  position.  But  the  wide‐range  up‐bar  off  the  low 
signaled the presence of demand. The high‐volume liftoff indicated that the 
force of the buying had overcome supply. And the greatly diminished wave 
volumes on the three down‐waves within the November correction reflect-
ed a lack of supply—especially the 19 million down‐wave. Over the next  
17 sessions, there are two up‐waves spanning nine and seven days, respec-
tively. Between them is a one‐day correction. Strong demand enters on the 
two  up‐waves. After  a  shallow  correction  in  December,  the  stock  makes 
another new high on the first trading day of January 2011. Notice the low 
wave volume that indicates no demand. This high marked the beginning of a 
top formation that lasted for several months prior to a large sell‐off.

See  how  the  waves  themselves  act  almost  like  moving  averages.  In  the 
mark‐up stage, prices may rise for 10 or more days without a correction 
on a closing basis. From the low of the down arrow, the stock rallied for

17 days. The one correction lasted only a day. This is a perfect example of 
the wave moving in an uninterrupted manner like a moving average. The one 
little correction was really a buying opportunity for a momentum trader.

Figure 10.6 of Boeing (10‐cent wave size) typifies the most common trade 
one frequently encounters. When we examine the bar chart alone, we see the 
vertical price rise at the end of April 2011. This behavior certainly had all the 
earmarks of a buying climax, but the actual volume failed to signal the supply 
on the first down‐wave. The wave volume gave a much clearer picture of sup-
ply on the first down‐wave. Here the cumulative volume revealed the greatest 
selling pressure since mid‐December 2010 and it is followed by a low‐volume 
secondary test of the high The bearish wave volume made this trade effortless. 
It was aided later by the pristine line drawn across the low of the first down‐
wave. After the line was penetrated, two minor rallies stopped against it. On 
the last wave, at the bottom of the down‐channel, supply dried up and the 
stock had a brief rally. It was unable to move above the first low made after the 
high. In August, Boeing found support around the 56 level.

As we have seen, Wyckoff’s tape reading chart involved surveying every 
price  change,  something  impractical  given  today’s  volatility. To  avoid  this 
problem, I use a wave chart based on the closing prices of any time period

from one minute to one day. Yet this is inconsistent because I am still rely-
ing on time‐based data. To avoid this inconsistency, I often use tick‐based 
charts. A tick bar chart consists of individual price bars based on a predeter-
mined number of ticks or price changes. For example, every 3,000‐tick bar 
has the same number of price changes. Under normal trading conditions, a  
3,000‐tick bar chart of  the  S&P  spans approximately  five  minutes. When 
trading activity increases after the release of an economic report, however, 
three bars of 3,000 ticks each may occur within five minutes. Thus a tick bar 
chart reflects trading activity. The volume plotted below the individual tick 
bars shows the actual numbers of shares or contracts traded. But the dura-
tion of the tick bars differs. One may span 4 minutes and the next one last  
18 minutes. It all depends on the speed of trading. Wyckoff saw the impor-
tance of activity. He had no way to make tick bar charts. Instead, he used a 
cruder method for judging the activity of the stock market in general: he 
measured the distance the ticker tape traveled in inches per wave.

Speaking of pristine behavior, the price/volume action on the 500‐tick bar 
chart of December 2012 gold (Figure 10.7) takes the cake. Clues abound about 
the coming down‐wave on September 25, 2012, a day when the S&P and many 
stocks were also hit by heavy selling (discussed in Chapter 11). The story starts 
with  the  shortening  of  the  upward  thrust  on  the  final  up‐wave  to  the  high, 
where the volume (2.0k) shrinks dramatically. More overt clues are the next 
two down‐waves on 5.9k and 5.1k, respectively. On the secondary test of the 
top, the wave volume increases to 4.1k. Despite this large effort, gold refuses 
to make a new high and we now know the market has encountered supply.  
On the ensuing sell‐off, the down‐wave volume (6.9k) is the largest on the 
chart to date. A relatively flat, three‐wave pattern unfolds from this low. The 
message of the third wave is overtly bearish. It consists of 7.2k volume, spans 
54 minutes, and has a very low angle of ascent. Here, we have a great deal of 
time and volume without making any upward progress (also on Figure 10.3), 
the personification of weakness. Always pay close attention when this behavior 
appears on a wave chart. It offers a high‐probability trade setup.

Similar behavior occurred in Tennant Corp. (Figure 10.8) during January 
2012. Here we have a 10‐cent wave applied to daily prices. Support formed in 
December 2011, but the first rally off this low failed to attract enough demand 
to sustain itself. The retest was most disconcerting as prices hovered for days 
just above the low. One down‐wave during this period of lateral movement 
lasted five days. The slow time coupled with the very heavy volume and rela-
tively flat angle of decline could be interpreted as sellers absorbing all buying. 
The bullish interpretation says bag holding is taking place as the buyers steadily

take all offers. Two up‐waves later the buyers show their hand as the stock ral-
lies on even heavier volume. On the final down‐wave, the sellers manage to 
break through the support line but there is no downward follow through and 
prices rally briskly. These nearly flat waves represent compression.

One of the most common trade setups involves shortening of the thrust. 
Traders often confuse shortening of the thrust with springs and upthrusts.

The name matters little. Shortening of the thrust is diminished progress as 
measured from high to high or low to low. When shortening of the thrust 
occurs on very low volume or heavy volume the message becomes more ap-
parent. It requires a minimum of three impulses, which may not always co-
incide with wave lines. Figure 10.9 of Cliffs Natural Resources demonstrates 
much of this behavior. If I wanted to specialize in a small handful of stocks, 
CLF would be one of my choices. The 10‐cent wave size works well and the 
stock has plenty of volume and volatility. On October 13, 2011, CLF held 
its earlier low at 11:00 a.m. despite the increased volume (159k). This was 
a minor double bottom and an orderly three‐wave impulse began. They are 
identified by drawing horizontal lines above the high points. The shortening 
of the upward thrust stands out clearly on the third wave where the volume 
(41k) was substantially lower than on the previous up‐wave. From this high, 
the stock corrected its recent rally. The next impulse consisted of four highs 
with shortening of the thrust in the final wave where the up‐volume (36k) 
was the lowest since the 11:00 a.m. low. From this high, the market traced 
a two‐wave pattern in which the second wave experienced a spring rather 
than shortening of the thrust. The final rally subdivided into two up‐waves 
but  the  price  bars  show  three.  I  always  measure  shortening  of  the  thrust 
from the price bars rather than the wave turning points.

Since shortening of the thrust stands out as the most common trade set-
up on intraday charts, I have formulated a few guidelines. Do not consider 
them to be ironclad rules.

  1.  After three or four successive waves or impulses up or down, look for a 
shortening of the thrust in the final wave. The wave usually makes little 
progress and the volume declines, indicating tired demand and/or loss 
of momentum. Sometimes the wave volume is heavy, but the shorten-
ing of the thrust indicates the large effort produced little reward. The 
so‐called Three‐Push Method ties the same behavior to divergences on 
an oscillator but makes no mention of thrust shortening.

  2.  When there are more than four successive waves and shortening of the 

thrust persists, the trend may be too strong to trade against.

  3.  When there are only two waves with small progress in the second wave, 
consider a spring or upthrust. Ideally, the volume should be low; how-
ever, small progress with heavy volume is acceptable.

  4.  The shortening of the thrust is determined mostly by the price bars’ highs 
and lows rather than by the waves’ turning points. But the wave volume 
tells the story about the strength or weakness of demand and supply.

Another word about item 1 above is required. When thrust shortening 
appears, always consider the larger picture. This rarely involves the weekly 
or monthly charts, but a check of the market’s position on the daily never 
hurts.  For  example,  price  rallies  above  the  top  of  a  three‐month  trading 
range  and  reverses  down. The  potential  upthust  becomes  the  overriding 
consideration. After  a  few  small  down‐waves,  the  downward  thrust  may 
shorten and suggest a long trade. Any long trade taken in this kind of situ-
ation is best avoided or quickly closed out if the response weakens. When 
prices are moving above/below turning points established during the previ-
ous up‐/down‐waves and breaking trend lines, be highly selective if trading 
against the trend. Determining when to act with the shortening of the thrust 
setup is an art, not an automatic trading device.

Many wave setups are often centered on the drawing in Figure 1.1 regard-
ing where to find trades. Setups combined with springs, upthrusts, absorption, 
and tests of breakouts and breakdowns work extremely well. When a spring/
upthrust occurs, look for a bullish/bearish change in behavior. If the selling/
buying  pressure  diminishes  on  the  next  pullback,  take  the  trade  and  always 
protect with a close stop below/above the extremity. The same works with a 
high‐volume breakout/breakdown. When these occur on heavy volume, watch 
the character of the pullback. Low volume at this point indicates a successful test 
of the breakout/breakdown and the trend should resume. Stop protection goes

immediately below/above the pullback pivot. The day trader will be astounded 
by the number of these type trades that show themselves in every session. Two 
basic  requirements:  patience  to  wait  for  the  setups  to  appear,  and  operating 
without any bias—don’t tell the market what it will do, let it tell you.

I mentioned specializing in one particular stock or market for the pur-
pose of intraday trading. To observe the minutiae, I often use a 100‐tick bar 
chart. This  helps  one  see  many  different  setups  during  a  trading  session. 
Figure 10.10 shows a 100‐tick bar of Newmont Mining on September 26, 
2012,  constructed  from  10‐cent  reversals. The  heavy  volume  in  the  first 
up‐waves set the tone for the day as they reflected aggressive buying. We see 
shortening of the upward thrust on the first three impulses. The sharp drop 
in volume on the third impulse warns that a down‐move will occur. It sub-
divides into three impulse waves with shortening of the thrust and dimin-
ished volume in the third wave down. As prices turn up from this low, longs 
should be established and stops placed under the low of the third wave. A 
big rush of buying hurls the stock above the early morning high. A tiny, four‐
minute pullback occurs before the start of the next up‐wave. During the 
markup, we see three impulse waves, and again the upward thrust shortens. 
This time the volume remains large but the shortening of the thrust warns 
that NEM is meeting supply. The first down‐wave from this high is a bear-
ish change in behavior. Here, we have the largest down‐volume since the  
11:00 a.m.  low,  and  the  down‐wave  is  the  largest  since  prices  broke  out 
above the morning high. Together, they indicate the day’s rally has ended.

Normally when I follow a 100‐tick bar chart, I scrunch the price move-
ment as tightly as possible so the individual bars are indistinguishable. I am 
interested only in the form of the behavior and the structure provided by the 
lines. Together, they tell a very readable story. Figure 10.11 presents such a 
chart of the June 2012 S&P with a 0.75‐point wave. It really needs little ex-
planation. The most important behavior relates to the low volume upthrust 
at the high and the shortening of the downward thrust within the sell‐off. 
The stopping volume in the down‐wave to 1339.75 indicated the end was 
near. On the decline to the final low, the thrust shortens and the down‐wave 
volume  diminishes.  Notice  the  very  high  volume  on  the  up‐wave  off  the 
low. It marked the beginning of a rally to 1356.75 over the next hour. Some 
might say this is trading on the head of a pin, but I think it provides a great 
edge for the intraday trader. Wyckoff would have loved it.

June 2012 S&P 100‐Tick Bar Chart 

One of my favorite chart constructions involves using two wave lines of dif-
ferent sizes. Figure 10.12 is a 250‐tick bar chart of the EURUSD with a 7‐pip 
wave and a 3‐pip wave. Tick volume is used on forex charts; therefore, each 
tick bar has total volume of 250 ticks. With the wave chart, we have a cumula-
tive total. From the 22:51 low, seven 7‐pip waves appear. The smaller 3‐pip 
wave line twists and turns along the larger wave. There are instances where 

c10.indd   176

the two waves fit together as on the 2000 volume decline to the 22:51 low. 
The smaller wave provides subtle clues about market direction thus helping 
traders establish a lower‐risk trade. On the first 3‐pip up‐wave off the 22:51 
low, the volume exceeds all of the previous up‐volumes since noon on the 
previous day. No supply appears on the next pullback. I would view this as a 
bullish change in behavior and enter a long position with a sell stop below the 
low. The uptrend resumes in an orderly fashion until supply appears on the  
1500 down‐wave and demand (1300 volume) shrinks as the thrust shortens 
on the final up‐wave. At this point, the message is: take profits.

On September 5, 2012, I monitored the S&P 1,000‐tick bar chart with 
a 0.50‐point and 1.25‐point wave plotted together. Between the high and 
the low, nine 1.25‐point waves appeared within the three‐hour decline. Ar-
rows are placed on the 0.50‐point waves and volumes where supply or weak 
demand indicated prices would move lower. I’m sure you can understand 
how the sellers gained control and pushed prices lower throughout the rest 
of the session.

When  watching  the  market,  I  find  trades  rather  than  seek  them.  Jack 
Schwager,  in  his  book,  New  Market Wizards,  included  an  interview  with  a 
trader  named  Mr.  Anonymous. This  trader  had  made  large  amounts  of 
money for his clients, but he felt they would not like his trading philosophy

as expressed in the interview. He therefore had the interview reduced to 
two pages and refused to reveal his identity. At the end of his remarks, he 
made the following statement: “When you are striving, struggling, forcing 
a trade you are out of sync, out of harmony. The best trade requires no ef-
fort.”1 I totally agree. This is what Wyckoff meant when he described the 
tape reader as an automaton. Finally, the sentiment expressed in this Tibetan 
precept speaks volumes about a tape reader’s mind‐set:

No thought, no reflection, no analysis
No cultivation, no intention;
Let it settle itself.

Point‐and‐Figure 
and Renko

In  this  age  of  algorithmic  and  high‐frequency  trading,  point‐and‐figure 

charts  attract  little  attention. They  occupy  a  dusty,  forlorn  place  in  the 
library  of  technical  analysis.  The  earliest  works  about  point‐and‐figure 
charting were written by “Hoyle,” an anonymous author, and Joseph Klein. 
Wyckoff presented point‐and‐figure charts in Studies in Tape Reading (1910). 
He used them extensively and most of the chapters in his original (1932) 
course dealt with the subject. Victor deVilliers, one of Wyckoff’s early as-
sociates, published his famous book The Point and Figure Method in 1933. An 
excellent overview of point‐and‐figure charting can be found in H. M. Gart-
ley’s Profits in the Stock Market (1981 edition). Wyckoff’s method of selecting 
stocks began by determining which stocks and groups were in the stron-
gest position in relation to the broader trend of the market. He surveyed 
the point‐and‐figure charts of these stocks and groups to determine where 
the largest amount of preparation existed. In one section of his course, he 
wrote, “When I was doing my best work, I discarded everything but a verti-
cal line chart of the daily average of 50 stocks, with volume, and the figure 
charts of about 150 leading stocks.” He added, “Figure charts are more valu-
able than Vertical [bar] charts.”

In  this  chapter,  I  discuss  two  of  the  most  important  aspects  of  point‐ 

and‐figure charting:

  1.  How to select point‐and‐figure box size and reversal.
  2.  How to locate a line of congestion and make projections.

c11.indd   179

We have already discussed the construction of point‐and‐figure charts 
based on a 1:1 and 1:3 ratio. Figure 9.3 of december 1993 bonds typifies 
the 1:1 or 1‐point type of chart. Figure 9.12 illustrates the 1:3 or 3‐point 
reversal. In Figure 9.2, I demonstrated a less common 1:2 ratio chart. 
Wyckoff’s workhorse was the 1‐point chart based on dollars per share. 
of course, he surveyed every price change to plot these charts. Given 
today’s  volatility,  most  point‐and‐figures  are  made  from  closing  prices 
of various time periods. When I want to make a point‐and‐figure chart, 
I first look for areas of price tightness. My study of currency futures led 
me  to  the  daily  continuation  chart  of  the  British  pound,  where  prices 
narrowed into a tight range between August 2012 and September 2011. 
A quick check of the monthly chart showed this tightness extends over to 
2009. Rather than trade futures, a long position in FXB, the eTF of the 
British pound, seemed low risk for a tax‐deferred account and would not 
involve  rolling  positions  from  one  contract  to  another. The  daily  price 
rise  from  the  154.52  low  on August  10  indicated  a  long  position  was 
warranted.

The next step involved deciding upon the box size and reversal unit. 
Let’s try a 1×1 calculated from daily closes (Figure 11.1). We immedi-
ately find seven very tight columns along the 154 line projecting a rise to 
161. (note that a count for an up‐move is always made from a price low; 
use a price high to project downward.) I like to make the count from the 
point where the up‐move begins in earnest. Some traders I have known 
would immediately measure across the entire span and expect a rise to 
the  maximum  count.  I  prefer  to  break  the  count  into  phases  starting 
with the most conservative one. one of the easiest ways to do this is to 
count over to a “wall” where prices accelerated upward or downward. 
Here, we have four phases projecting a minimum 7‐point rise to 161 and 
a maximum 21‐point rise to 175. The average of the four targets calls 
for a move to 168.75. A move of this magnitude would extend into the 
band  between  the  2009–2011  highs.  But  we  still  do  not  know  where 
the up‐move will peak. In the end, the point‐and‐figure projections are 
guidelines;  however,  they  have  an  uncanny  accuracy. The  11  columns 
counted across the 164 line called for a decline to 153, which the stock 
reached one‐month later. notice that prices did not trade in 4 out of the 
11 columns combined to make this count. After the stock fell more than 
$7 from the 164 congestion line, it would have been clear a larger count 
should be made.

next,  we  see  a  1:3  ratio  chart  made  with  a  4‐point  box  size  and  a 
12‐point reversal (i.e., 4 × 3); it is calculated from daily cash Standard & 
Poor’s  (S&P)  prices  (Figure  11.2). The  congestion  across  the  1344  line 
spanned five months between February and July 2011. Its projection for 
a decline to 1100 exceeded the actual low by only eight points. As of this 
writing, all but two counts on this chart have been unfulfilled. The largest 
count consists of 17 columns across the 1160 line in the period between 
november and August 2011. When the projected points are added to the 
1160  line,  the  target  is  1484;  however,  another  count  can  be  made  by 
adding the points to the low point of the count zone. This generated a less 
extreme 1424 target. Point‐and‐figure charts are noted for filtering price 
data  and  thus  showing  the  broader  framework  of  price  movement.  It  is 
accomplished  by  adjusting  the  price  reversal  and  data  field  to  the  point 
of maximum clarity like focusing a microscope. With practice, one learns 
how to find the right balance.

Choosing the best box size, reversal and data field for a point‐and‐figure 
requires practice. Let’s take the example of Hecla Mining, a relatively low‐
priced  stock,  after  the  close  on  Friday, August  3,  2012. The  weekly  chart  
(Figure 11.3) has a tight pattern between August and January 2012. Weakness 
in April–May pushed prices below a support line before the upward reversal 
in the week ending May 25. This can be viewed as a spring. It is followed by

10 weeks of lateral movement within an 81‐cent range as the stock stands 
on  the  springboard  awaiting  a  catalyst. To  make  a  point‐and‐figure  chart,  I 
prefer to begin with daily data because they tend to create tighter patterns. A 
1:1 ratio chart will usually offer more lateral movement. A 25‐cent box and 
reversal size may work but these values are about 6 percent of the stock price. 
A smaller percent will show more price work but only a few keystrokes are 
needed to change the parameters. not unexpectedly, Figure 11.4 is unsatisfac-
tory. First, the congestion across the 4.25 line only covers nine columns. The 
calculation (9 × 0.25) + 4.25 projects a rise to 6.50, a respectable return; but 
it is not in proportion to the amount of time spent moving laterally. Secondly, 
the January 2012 low does not appear because the chart is constructed from 
daily closes and thus filters out intraday lows and highs. Thus any point‐and‐
figure chart made from daily closes will have the same problem.

Figure  11.5  takes  a  different  tact.  It  uses  a  smaller  box  size  and  re-
versal  (0.05  ×  3)  calculated  from  hourly  closes. Anyone  familiar  with 
point‐and‐figure charts would like this setup. Here, we see three sepa-
rate phases that generate targets of 7.15, 8.50, and 11.20, respectively.

Wyckoff would look at this chart and explain how the composite opera-
tor accumulated stock during the eight‐month period. Composite operator 
was Wyckoff’s generic term for the insiders and pools, who profited by 
accumulating or distributing stock in preparation for a campaign trade. 
Here,  we  see  that  the  large  operators  forced  prices  below  the  trading 
range  in April  to  find  out  how  much  supply  could  be  drawn  out. The 
50‐cent upswing at point 1 marked the largest gain since the February 
high and reflected demand. The next pullback failed to retrace 50 percent 
of the up‐move, a bullish condition. on the rise to point 3, the upward 
thrust  shortened  as  bids  were  pulled. The  price  action  between  points 
4 and 6 shows the composite operator tried to keep a lid on the stock 
in order to complete his line. From the low at point 6, the stock was in 
strong hands as the volatility ceased and price rose steadily. I don’t doubt 
such large forces are at work in the marketplace, but their activities are 
not  the  focus  of  my  attention. The  count  made  across  the  4.45  line  in 
Figure 11.5 is subdivided into three phases. Count AB covers the price 
movement from early August to late June. AC stretches leftward to the 
breakdown on April 10, and Ad incorporates all the price work to the 
January 11, 2012, low. The chart is posted through September 25, 2012, 
and shows the strong liftoff out of the trading range. Helca peaked on the 
last up‐move shown here at 6.94 just 20 cents below the count AB target. 

c11.indd   184

If the stock holds above 4.45 on the next pullback, the larger counts may 
be fulfilled in the future.

Figure  11.6  of  the  March  2011  five‐year  note  is  one  of  my  favorite 
examples. The  minimum  tick  in  this  contract  is  one‐quarter  32nd  val-
ued  at  $7.8125.  The  point‐and‐figure  chart  uses  a  one‐quarter  32nd 
(0.0078125)  box  size  and  a  reversal  2×  greater  (0.015625)—in  other 
words, a 1:2 ratio. It is constructed from 3‐minute closing prices. Here, 
the duration of each column (or wave) is plotted on the chart. You see how 
the early morning low at 11715.5 was penetrated on the sell‐off to the 
final low. The first down‐move covered eight ticks in 33 minutes; the sec-
ond spanned six ticks in 18 minutes; the third equaled three ticks in only  
9 minutes. You can see the ranges narrowing and the time lessening exactly 
as occurred on the wave charts. It reflects no ease of downward movement 
and diminishing time on the down‐moves. The selling pressure is clearly 
spent. From this low, the market rallies 12 ticks over the next 33 minutes.

on the way to the day’s high, most of the down‐waves last between 3 and 
9 minutes, with the exception of two spanning 15 and 18 minutes. Both 
of these down‐waves equal the minimal two‐tick reversal, which tells an-
other story. Prices rally vigorously over 24 minutes to the top (11724.75). 
Because they exceed the upper limit of this handmade chart the full swing 
is clipped short. This is the most amount of time on any up‐wave since the 
contract rose from the low. It assuredly had climactic volume. The next 
down‐move covers a relatively small amount of ground, but the 36 minutes  
stand out as the largest downtime. Imagine all this time spent without any 
ability to recover. I think Wyckoff would say the composite operator is try-
ing to support the market in order to establish more shorts. It is an overtly 
bearish change in behavior and leads to the largest down‐move of the day 
session. notice that it lasted only 6 minutes in response to a bearish Trea-
sury  auction. The  last  upswing  (11722.75)  in  the  top  formation  lasted  
9  minutes  before  prices  plummeted  over  the  next  36  minutes. The  19 
boxes across this line project a decline to 11713.25. Prices fulfilled the 
conservative  target  of  11715.25,  calculated  from  the  day’s  high. As  an 
aside, the five‐year note is an excellent trading vehicle for low‐capitalized 
and/or less experienced traders. Given the low margin rate and big vol-
ume, large traders can easily trade size to make the smaller swings more 
worthwhile.

It should be obvious that one can substitute time for volume. To make 
this information more accessible on all point‐and‐figure charts, a friend 
created a simple indicator that plotted the duration of each column as a 
histogram  below  the  price  work.  Figure  11.7  shows  this  indicator  on  a 
december 2012 silver point‐and‐figure chart (0.01 × 3) made from one‐
minute closes. Supply first appears at point 1, but the next up‐wave (point 
2) tests the earlier high. At this point, the buyers have an opportunity to 
gain the upper hand. The lack of upward follow and the ease of downward 
movement at point 3 say the sellers are stronger. Silver then treads water 
over the next 50 minutes until buying emerges at point 4 where prices 
hold firm without a 3‐cent reversal for 25 minutes. The bullish argument 
says  the  buyers  are  absorbing  the  selling.  Price  must  continue  higher.  
Instead, silver hesitates for 17 minutes and drifts to point 5, where the 
uptime is only four minutes. Because of the market’s inability to rise after 
the action at point 4, we know it encountered supply. The down‐wave at 
point 6 over the next 25 minutes erases the bullish story. The sellers main-
tain their pressure on the market at point 7 for an additional 36 minutes. 
Following the break below the low of point 4, an outpouring of selling

congestion along the 34.51 congestion line projected a decline to 33.85. 
Before the closing bell, december silver reached 33.92.

Source: TradeStation.

Between the lows at points 3 and 7, silver traded for 3 hours and 21 minutes. 
The action at point 7 is particularly telling as the sellers keep the pressure on for 
36 minutes. Twenty‐two waves formed during this period, which is much more 
manageable than the corresponding 201 one‐minute price bars. The capability 
to  filter  price  movement  is  one  of  the  benefits  derived  from  using  a  point‐ 
and‐figure. But I know of no way to determine the amount of time and volume 
for each “x” or “o” unless a chart is manually maintained, as shown in Figure 9.3.  
That chart did not provide the minutes for each plot. Renko charts offer this 
capability making it the consummate tape reading medium. I doubt Wyckoff  
ever  saw  a  renko  chart,  but,  if  he  had,  its  benefits  would  have  attracted  his

utmost attention. If you look through the books and articles on renko, the same  
information is repeatedly stated: the Japanese invented renko about a century 
ago, it is composed of bricks or renga, it shows support and resistance levels ex-
tremely well, and it deals only with price without regard for time and volume. 
Fortunately, computerized renko charts do provide the volume and duration of 
each brick. Because of this, wave volume can be plotted below the swings on 
the renko charts. They come closest to re‐creating Wyckoff’s original tape read-
ing charts—except he did not show the time between the waves.

Figure  11.8  Renko Brick Formation diagram

Renko charts, like point‐and‐figure, filter out much of the noise and am-
biguities  that  accompany  bar  charts. The  formation  of  a  renko  brick  is  de-
picted in Figure 11.8. Assume we are looking at a number of rising bricks 
with  a  $1  size. The  last  completed  up‐brick  in  the  progression  stopped 
at 10. To form another up‐brick the stock will have to trade at $11; to re-
verse  direction  and  complete  a  down‐brick  the  stock  will  have  to  fall 
one  dollar  below  the  last  low  to  $8.  Before  the  new  brick  forms,  pric-
es  can  therefore  travel  within  a  $2.50  range. The  new  brick  might  last  
50 minutes before completion. during this time, a five‐minute bar chart can 
give mixed messages that may prompt a trader to close out a trade prematurely

or totally miss the coming move. For this reason, renko charts offer peace of 
mind. They reduce the number of decisions. The buildup of time per brick 
stems from brick size and the speed of the trading. Rapid price movement 
causes bricks to last only seconds. other times, a lengthy brick time may oc-
cur as prices absorb through support or resistance levels. Think of a one‐point 
brick in the S&P between 1190 and 1191. Let’s assume it’s the most recent 
brick in an upward progression. during the next brick’s formation, prices can 
fluctuate between 1191.75 and 1189.25—2.50 points—for as long as it takes 
until an 1192 or 1189 print occurs. naturally, if the brick size is 0.50‐point, 
the time per brick will be smaller and many more will appear; a 3‐point brick 
will obviously span much more time. A day trader in forex or currency futures 
might use a 5‐pip brick (‐.0005), while a swing trader could use a 20‐pip brick 
(0.002). one of the distinguishing features of renko is its freedom from time 
periods. As soon as price fills one brick, another begins. This makes it more 
akin to Wyckoff’s tape reading chart, where price changes are not tied to set 
time periods. This also holds true for waves on renko charts.

Figure 11.9 presents a 5‐pip renko chart of december 2011 Australian 
dollar on december 9. Here we see a double top that spanned 50 minutes. 
The 855‐contract volume in the brick at the second peak was the largest 
to date. It lasted only 7 minutes. on the next up‐brick, volume expands to 
1,270 contracts over 21 minutes. It spent all that time without making fur-
ther gains (effort versus reward). When price turns down in the next brick, 
we know the sellers overcame the buyers’ attempts to take prices higher. 
Another way of looking at it is to consider that the sellers were selling at 
the ask price. In other words, they were not selling at the bid, but rather 
sold to the buyers who were paying up to own more contracts. This is the 
same degree of distribution Wyckoff observed on his tape reading charts. 
The buying effort failed to take prices higher, and it is followed by an even 
larger  amount  of  selling  (1979  contracts)  on  the  next  down‐brick.  Here 
a 22‐minute struggle takes place. Given the lack of demand after the last 
up‐brick, the sellers appear in the stronger position. If another down‐brick 
unfolds, the odds greatly favor lower prices and a short position would be  
warranted.  Buy  stops  should  be  placed  just  above  the  high  of  the  last  
up‐brick. In about 90 minutes the contract reached 1.0103.

now look at Figure 11.10. I’m almost certain the stock is TVIX in early 
September 2011. The brick size looks like 20 cents. From the pre-session 
bottom, all of the lows held at a higher level. notice the heavy down‐volume 
and down‐time in bricks 1, 3, and 6. What is the message? It is exactly the  
same  message  as  we  saw  in  Figure  11.6  where  the  five‐year  note  spent

15 and 18 minutes on two small two‐tick pullbacks. Someone was buying. 
In TVIX, these three bricks underscore accumulation. Wyckoff wrote about 
this kind of accumulation rather than some static, preconceived model. Just 
imagine: at point 3 the stock spent 20 minutes as volume swelled to 200k 
shares and then price rallied 60 cents! At point 6, the volume was over 250k 
in 90 minutes, and the stock again refused to move lower. The low‐volume 
pullback at point 7 put the stock on the springboard. There is one more di-
mension to this chart. From the low at point 3, nine waves can be counted 
to the leftmost downswing. Multiply 9 by 0.20 and add to the low (39.80), 
for a target of 41.60. Thus, renko charts can be used like point‐and‐figure 
charts to make price projections.

My  first  handmade  experiments  with  renko  charts  involved  plotting  the 
swings vertically so they better resembled a point‐and‐figure chart. This made 
the lines of congestion stand out better. It wasn’t long, however, before one of 
my students devised a renko format where the volume and time are plotted 
within the brick. Figure 11.11 of december 2012 S&P on September 25, 2012,

consists of a 0.75‐point brick size. The upper number within the brick is the 
volume; time is the lower number. Wave volume and duration are entered at 
the wave turning points. The result is a powerful tape reading chart (compare to 
Figures 9.1 and 9.3) with time per plot added. It goes beyond anything Wyckoff 
ever constructed. The top brick took 15 minutes to form, and volume increased 
to 35k. This large effort failed to produce further gains, thus raising the suspi-
cion that supply had overcome demand. The next two bricks lasted 43 minutes 
and the volume totaled 86k; it was then obvious that the S&P met supply on the 
last up‐wave. The first large down‐wave out of this top drew out 189k contracts 
over the next 78 minutes, which marked the beginning of a much larger break.
I have included a 0.25 × 3 point‐and‐figure (Figure 11.12), which shows 
the entire top on September 25, 2012. The count across the 1455.25 line 
projected a decline to 1436.50, 1.5 points above the closing low. This chart 
shows  the  accuracy  of  point‐and‐figures  constructed  from  small,  intraday 
price movement. The only drawback to such a chart is the way it handles the 
overnight data. Because the price movement is slower at night, the minutes 
per column can become unusually large, and they tend to dwarf day‐session 
data. Therefore,  I  adjust  the  scale,  which  in  essence  clips  off  the  larger

readings. The result is an indicator with elegant simplicity. Here, the down-
turn after the upthrust spans 35 minutes, the largest amount of downtime 
(read volume) since the opening of the day session. The next up‐move lasted 
four minutes. When the S&P fell below the low of the previous down‐wave 
(1454.50),  the  message  was  clear:  Go  Short.  In  Studies  in Tape  Reading, 
Wyckoff wrote: “[The tape reader] must be able to say: the facts are these; 
the resulting indications are these; therefore I will do thus and so.”1 I call 
it the moment of recognition when you sense a move is about to happen. The 
realization sweeps you into taking action.

The  reading  of  the  S&P  0.75‐point  wave  chart  on  September  25,  2012  
(Figure 11.13), gave the same insight as the message on the renko and point‐
and‐figure charts. Look at the shortening of the upward thrust and the large 
effort on the last up‐wave (59k). The wave volume was the heaviest on the 
chart up to that point, and price exceeded the previous high by only one‐half 
point.  But  it’s  the  large  wave  volume  that  drives  home  the  message  as  the 
force of the buying encountered a larger force of supply. The sell‐off below the 
previous low (1455), said the die was cast and immediate action warranted. 
In this instance, the bearish change in behavior (i.e., upthrust and large effort 
with no reward) was not followed by a low‐volume pullback. The market fell 
three points on 187k volume before having a minor correction to 1452.50.

For  the  record,  Figure  11.14  shows  the  december  2012  S&P  five‐ 
minute  bar  chart  for  the  same  day.  I  was  weaned  on  hourly  and  five‐ 
minute  bar  charts  and  certainly  can  read  the  bearish  story  here.  The  
upthrust/shortening of the thrust stand out clearly. on the last price bar to 
the high, the position of the close indicates that the market met selling. But 
there is no increase in volume to tell us the sellers have gained the upper 
hand. As I have said before, “The true force of the buying is lost in time.” This 
is not the case in all situations, and there will be times when the five‐minute 
chart provides a better picture of events; however, it occurs too rarely.

Wyckoff maintained a wave chart of market leaders calculated from their 
intraday price swings. originally, it was constructed in a more precise man-
ner but in modern times it has been calculated from closing one‐minute or 
five‐minute  time  periods. Wyckoff  showed  how  the  wave  chart  of  market 
leaders can be plotted alongside the tape reading chart so the waves on both 
can be compared. The wave chart of S&P futures serves as my indicator for 
the market at large. I know of traders who monitor the waves in the SPY for 
clues about market direction. on September 25, 2012, there must have been 
hundreds of stocks with wave or renko charts that flashed the same bearish

message  as  the  S&P.  I  randomly  selected  a  10‐cent  renko  chart  of  union 
Pacific (Figure 11.15) for that date and the bearish evidence stood out at a 
glance. Hopefully, you see it. At the turning points on the chart, I have plot-
ted the wave volume (in thousands) and the number of minutes. If we had 
to choose one brick that told us what to expect, we would have to select the 
128k down‐brick at 11:54 a.m. edT. The volume in this one 10‐cent brick 
exceeded the volume on the 60‐cent up‐wave, where a total of 104k shares 
traded. The total wave volume on the decline to the 11:54 a.m. low exceed-
ed the volumes on the previous two up‐waves combined. So this is the spot 
on the chart where we know what will happen. The down‐move to the 11:54 
a.m. low occurred about eight minutes after the decline below 1455 on the 
S&P wave chart. Yet unP held for another 21 minutes before it followed the 
S&P lower. This lag time would have benefited anyone trading unP.

Larger brick sizes work very well for trading the intermediate swings. For 
stocks trading above $20 per share, I like to use 30‐cent bricks. Figure 11.16 
shows 4‐point bricks calculated from S&P continuation data. By filtering so  
much  of  the  intraday  noise,  this  chart  makes  it  easier  to  hold  trades  for  
20  points  or  more  per  contract. The  first  large  up‐wave  spans  most  of

three sessions on 4.74 million contract volume. one‐fourth of that volume 
emerged in the second brick (1) of the wave and again in the final brick (2). 
The one served as the prime mover, and the other signaled stopping action. 
After this climactic action, profits should have been taken as soon as a down‐
brick formed. Twenty‐eight points were captured between these two bricks. 
The wave volume on the ensuing down‐move was less than recorded in the 
second brick of the up‐wave. At (3), the S&P tried to absorb through the over-
head resistance. only one brick printed in the next down‐wave (4), and it had 
large volume. As soon as a brick formed above the horizontal line, we would 
have known the high volume indicated the absorption was complete and the 
buyers were in control. It was the ideal spot to reestablish long positions. The 
S&P then rallied another 24 points before supply entered the picture.

I mentioned earlier that my initial experiments with renko involved mak-
ing a chart where the bricks unfolded vertically. The vertical format allowed 
more price data to appear on the chart as opposed to the traditional diagonal 
movement. In addition, a line of congestion on a renko chart can be used to 
make projections of how far prices may travel.

Figure 11.17 is a handmade chart of the March 2012 S&P on december 16,  
2011. The brick size is one point. This first effort was literally scribbled

onto a piece of notebook paper. The volume numbers in thousands of con-
tracts are written at each price. Initially, I did not show the minutes per 
brick, but these were added later. on the down‐move from the high, no-
tice  the  two  bricks  where  the  volumes  rose  to  182k  and  102k,  respec-
tively. Here, we had a combined volume of 286k over a 63‐minute period 
as  the  sellers  clearly  gained  the  upper  hand.  Just  prior  to  the  up‐move 
to  the  day’s  high,  notice  the  low‐volume  pullback  (9k)  that  reflected  a 
total lack of selling pressure and offered an excellent buying opportunity.  
The point‐and‐figure congestion across the 1218.75 line, where the 9k volume  
appeared, projected a rise to 1223.75, one point below the high. Look at 
the top price, where the brick volume soared to 79k, the largest reading

on the chart. I think you can see the usefulness of such a chart. Right now, 
it’s a work in progress.

When I first heard of the Wyckoff method, it was spoken about in hushed 
tones. no one wanted to let too many people in on the best‐kept trading 
secret. even today, one of my friends doesn’t want me to divulge all of this 
information. The reason is simple: it works, so why publicize it? As I said in 
the Introduction, I have no secrets, and I’m certain Wyckoff did not either. 
His avowed purpose was to help traders develop an intuitive judgment with 
which to read what the market says about itself rather than to “operate in a 
hit or miss way.” In Studies in Tape Reading, he wrote: “Money is made in Tape 
Reading [chart reading] by anticipating what is coming—not by waiting till 
it happens and going with the crowd.”2 I’m sure he would agree with the 
message behind Trades About to Happen.
