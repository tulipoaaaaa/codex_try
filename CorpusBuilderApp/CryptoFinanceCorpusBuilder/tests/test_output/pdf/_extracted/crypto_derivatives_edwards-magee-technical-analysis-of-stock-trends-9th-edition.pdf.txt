Preface to the 9th Edition

Warp speed universe. Warp speed ﬁnancial markets. The 8th Edition of this
classic book appeared when it seemed that the millennium and paradise had
been achieved and that, like McKay’s tulipomania, the price of stocks would
rise  forever  and  men  would  rush  from  the  world  over  and  pay  whatever
price was asked for what-was-its-name.com, Internet.groceries, or ihype.com
or  icon.com  or  gotcha.com. And,  feature  this, 
The  bubble  was
just  in  the  process  of  bursting,  of  course.  Before  it  burst  fabulous  fortunes
were  made  by  roller  blader  and  scooter  tycoons  and  by  young  geeks  with
nothing but chutzpah and a laptop. One of my favorite stories is of the young
entrepreneur who said “Why don’t I deserve it (the $100MM he made in the
IPO)? I’ve devoted three years of my life to this project.” (Now dead.)

Dow  36000. 

Now many of those people are in prison and the hangover lingers on.
Lying, cheating, and stealing on all sides. From Enron to Arthur Anderson.
Billions, if not trillions into a black hole. As all this developed I warned of
the  impending  collapse  in  the  John  Magee  Investment  Letters  on  the  web.
There  was  nothing  magic  or  brilliant  about  seeing  what  was  going  on.
Perspective  and  perception  came  from  applying  the  lessons  taught  in  this
book by Edwards and Magee. Like Benedict XVI (in a different area) I am a
humble worker in their vineyard. 

I press on attempting to modernize (where necessary) and extend their
work, ﬁt it to the modern situation and make it even more useful to current
day traders and investors.

In this ongoing labor of love I have been immeasurably assisted by my
graduate  students  and  colleagues  at  Golden  Gate  University  in  San  Fran-
cisco. In constant interaction with them, I have been stimulated to see impor-
tant aspects of Edwards and Magee’s work and develop and emphasize these
elements in my teaching and in this new edition. 

Speciﬁcally, both long-term and short-term traders will ﬁnd important
new material in this edition. In my graduate seminars I have seen the power
of what Magee called the “Basing Points” procedure and so have extended
the  treatment  of  this  material.  My  interest  in  and  respect  for  Dow  Theory
have recently increased as the result of a paper done with Brian Brooker for
the  Market  Technicians  Association  (“Dissecting  Dow  Theory”).  Material
from that paper will be found in this edition. Short-term traders and futures
speculators  will  appreciate  extensive  new  material  on  commodity  trading.
These  traders  have  been  entirely  too  inﬂuenced  by  mechanical  number-
driven systems of recent years and need to restore perspective by mastering
the material in this book. 

It was never the intent of this book to forecast or analyze current markets.
Rather it’s purpose was, and is, to learn from history and the past so as to
be better able to deal with the present and the future. Current markets are

 
 
 
 
 
AU3772_C000.fm  Page 6  Tuesday, November 21, 2006  1:50 PM

analyzed (and forecast?) at the John Magee website. Nonetheless, the very
process of keeping current involves picturing issues and instruments in play.
The major indices themselves in 2005 were in play, and gold, silver and oil.
We don’t know how they will pan out. But we can make an analysis with
the data we have.
 For this is the situation the analyst is faced with every day.
He doesn’t know how it will turn out. But, by following the methods and
principles  taught  in  this  book  he  can  put  himself  on  the  right  side  of  the
probabilities.

This  is  no  idle  remark.  The  power  and  effectiveness  of  classical  chart
analysis can be seen by examining how it performed in the past at critical
times. At the John Magee Technical Analysis website the following comment
was made in January 2000: 

Dow: The Dow can expect to ﬁnd support at 10000 and is buyable,
but  in  small  commitments  or  portions  of  a  portfolio  or  additions
thereto. We expect to see it in a very large seesaw from 9-12000 for
some time and would hedge at the high end and increase commit-
ments and lift hedges on oversold conditions at the low end.

In November 2000 the following comment was made:

November 18, 2000

There  is  really  only  one  chart  pattern  of  signiﬁcance  in  these
markets, and that is the big one, more than 12 months long now,
and the pattern is a big serpent, whipping back and forth, and as
Shakespeare said, signifying nothing. Nothing that is but more of
the same. How will we know when it signiﬁes something? Well
we won't really know till we know, but we'll let you know when
we know. So we would continue to pick likely shorts and employ
short  term  trading  strategies  for  traders,  and  hedge  at  interim
tops  and  lift  the  hedges  at  bottoms.  Based  on  the  chart  picture
and last week's anemic behavior we would not trade for bounces
in the NASDAQ. If anything it is a short, but a risky one. 

These past letters, dramatically illustrating the effectiveness of the meth-
ods of this book, may be found online through links at the address speciﬁed
below. Your editor, personally, is not a genius for having made these analyses.
It is the method that is to credit, and any number of my graduate students
can make the same analyses, as can any alert chart analyst.

The reader should not skip the prefatory material to the 8th Edition. The
same practices outlined there have been followed in this edition. Magee said
the reader should not skim through this book and put it on his library shelf.
Instead it should be read and reread and constantly referred to. And so the
reader should, yes, so he should.

Richard Russell, the dean of Dow Theory Analysts, has reportedly said
that the price of the Dow and the price of gold will cross in coming years.
He  has  also  remarked  that  the  S&P  appears  to  evince  a  10-year  head-and-
shoulders  pattern.  Robert  Prechter  believes  we  are  at  the  crest  of  the  tidal
wave and the tsunami cometh. 

Dow  36000.  Dow  3000.  This  book  contains  the  best  tools  to  cope  with

whatever the future holds.

A Special Note Concerning Resources on the Web
In the age of instant and easy (and free) access to information on the Internet
it would be foolish to ignore the opportunities available to interact with the
material  of  this  book.  So  the  reader  will  ﬁnd  numerous  free  materials  that
augment  the  book  at  www.edwards-magee.com/nf05/ninthedition.html.
For  example,  when  the  reader  learns  in  Chapter  28  of  the  Basing  Points
Procedure he will be able to go to the website and print out a PDF of material
that  he  can  place  beside  Figure  210.1  for  instant  and  easy  cross  reference,
instead of having to turn pages constantly back and forth from the chart to
the keys and commentary, or having to bend the book into pretzels at a copy
machine. In general, wherever references are made in the text to the website
it is for this purpose, to give the reader easy and ﬂexible usage of the material.
And,  likewise,  at  this  address  the  reader  will  ﬁnd  links  to  past  letters  that
show how the method functioned in real time in real markets.

A Special Note about Dow Theory
Senator Everett Dirkson said one time that trying to get U.S. Senators herded
together and moving in one direction was like trying to transport bull frogs
in  a  wheelbarrow.  Trying  to  synchronize  the  signals  of  the  various  Dow
Theory analysts is a similarly challenging proposition. No Ayatollah exists
to issue the ﬁnal fatwa as to whether the signal is valid. Always one to abhor
a vacuum I have organized a committee at Golden Gate University to eval-
uate  pronouncements  of  signals  and  opine  as  to  whether  the  signals  are
valid. This committee may be contacted at the addresses found in Resources
and at cbassetti@ggu.edu.

Preface to the Eighth Edition

Here is a strange event. A book written in the mid-20th century retains its
relevancy and importance to the present day. In fact, Technical Analysis of
Stock  Trends  remains  the  deﬁnitive  book  on  the  subject  of  analyzing  the
stock market with charts. Knock-offs, look-alikes, pale imitations have pro-
liferated  in  its  wake  like  sea  gulls  after  a  productive  ﬁshing  boat.  But  the
truth is they have added nothing new to the body of knowledge Edwards
and Magee originally produced and Magee reﬁned up to the 5th edition.

What accounts for this rare occasion of a book’s passing to be a classic? To
be more, in fact, than a classic, to be the manual or handbook for current usage?
To  answer  this  question  we  must  ask  another.  What  are  Chart  forma-
tions? Chart formations identiﬁed and analyzed by the authors are graphic
representations of unchanging human behavior in complex multivariate sit-
uations.

They are the depiction of multifarious human actions bearing on a single
variable (price). On price converge a galaxy of inﬂuences: fear, greed, desire,
cunning, malice, deceit, naiveté, earnings estimates, broker need for income,
gullibility, professional money managers’ need for performance and job secu-
rity, supply and demand of stocks, monetary liquidity and money ﬂow, self-
destructiveness, passivity, trap setting, manipulation, blind arrogance, con-
spiracy  and  fraud  and  double  dealing,  phases  of  the  moon  and  sun  spots,
economic cycles and beliefs about them, public mood, and the indomitable
human need to be right.

Chart formations are the language of the market, telling us that this stock
is  in  its  death  throes;  that  stock  is  on  a  rocket  to  the  moon;  that  a  life  and
death battle is being waged in this issue; and in that other, the buyers have
defeated the sellers and are breaking away.

They  are,  in  short,  the  inerasable  ﬁngerprints  of  human  nature  made

graphic in the greatest struggle, next to war, in human experience.

As  Freud  mapped  the  human  psyche,  so  have  Edwards  and  Magee
mapped the human mind and emotions as expressed in the ﬁnancial markets.
Not only did they produce a deﬁnitive map, they also produced a method-
ology for interpreting and proﬁting from the behavior of men and markets.
It  is  difﬁcult  to  imagine  further  progress  in  this  area  until  the  science  of
artiﬁcial intelligence, aided by yet unimaginable computer hardware, makes
new breakthroughs.

If It Is Deﬁnitive, Why Offer a New Edition?

Unlike Nostradamus and Jules Verne (and many current investment advisors),
the  authors  did  not  have  a  crystal  ball  or  a  time  machine.  Magee  did  not

 
 
 
 
 
AU3772_C000.fm  Page 10  Tuesday, November 21, 2006  1:50 PM

foresee the electronic calculator and made do with a slide rule. And while
he  knew  of  the  computer,  he  did  not  anticipate  that  every  housewife  and
investor would have 1000 times the power of a Whirlwind or Univac I on
his (her) desk (cf. Note on Gender). In short, the March of Time. The Progress
of Science. The Inexorable Advance of Technology.

Amazingly, the great majority of this book needed no update or actual-
ization. Who is to improve on the descriptions of chart formations and their
signiﬁcance?

But insofar as updates are necessary to reﬂect the changes in technology
and in the character and composition of the markets, that is another story.
Human character may not change, but in the new millennium there is noth-
ing but change in the character and composition of the markets. And while
regulatory forces might not be completely in agreement, the majority of these
changes  have  been  positive  for  the  investor  and  the  commercial  user.  Of
course, Barings Bank and some others are less than ecstatic with these devel-
opments.

An Outline of the Most Important Additions Made 
to This Book to Reﬂect Changes in the Times, 
Technology, and Markets

Generally speaking, these additions, annotations, and updates are intended
to  inform  the  general  reader  of  conditions  of  which  he  must  be  aware  for
investing success. In most cases, because of the enormous amount of mate-
rial, no attempt is made to be absolutely exhaustive in the treatment of these
developments. Rather the effort is made to put changes and new conditions
in perspective and furnish the investor with the resources and proper guide
to pursue subjects at greater length if desired. In fact, an appendix has been
provided,  entitled  Resources,  to  which  the  reader  may  turn  when  he  has
mastered the material of the book proper.

The stubborn individualist may realize investment success with the use
of this book alone (and paper, pencil, ruler, and chart paper (cf. Section on
TEKNIPLAT™ chart paper).

Technology

In order to equip this book to serve as a handbook and guide for the markets
of  the  new  millennium,  certain  material  has  been  added  to  the  text  of  the
5th  and  7th  editions.  Clearly  the  astounding  advances  in  technology  must
be dealt with and put in the context of the analytical methods and material
of the original. To achieve success in the new, brave world, an investor must
be aware of and utilize electronic markets, the Internet, the microcomputer,
wireless communications, and new exchanges offering every kind of exotica
imaginable.

 
 
 
 
 
 
AU3772_C000.fm  Page 11  Tuesday, November 21, 2006  1:50 PM

The  advanced  investor  should  also  be  aware  of  and  understand  some
of  the  developments  in  ﬁnance  and  investment  theory  and  technology  —
the  Black–Scholes  Model,  Modern  Portfolio  Theory,  Quantitative Analysis.
Fortunately, all these will not be dealt with here, because in truth one intel-
ligent investor with a piece of chart paper and a pencil and a quote source
can deal with the markets, but that is another story we will explore later in
the  book.  Some  of  these  germane  subjects  will  be  discussed  sufﬁciently  to
put  them  in  perspective  for  the  technical  analyst,  and  then  guides  and
resources  will  be  pointed  out  for  continued  study.  My  opinion  is  that  the
mastery of all these subjects is not wholly necessary for effective investing
at the private level. What need does the general investor have for an under-
standing  of  the  Cox–Ross–Rubinstein  options  analysis  model  to  recognize
trends? The Edwards–Magee model knows things about the market the CRR
model does not.

Trading and Investment Instruments

The new universe of available trading and investment instruments must be
taken into account. The authors would have been in paradise at the profusion
of  alternatives.  In  this  future  world,  they  could  have  traded  the Averages
(one of the most important changes explored in this book); used futures and
options as investment and hedging mechanisms; practiced arbitrage strate-
gies  beyond  their  wildest  dreams;  and  contemplated  a  candy  store  full  of
investment  products.  The  value  and  utility  of  these  products  would  have
been  immeasurably  enhanced  by  their  mastery  of  the  charting  world  of
technical analysis. As only one example, one world-prominent professional
trader I know has made signiﬁcant proﬁts selling calls on stocks he correctly
analyzed to be in down trends, and vice versa — an obvious (or, as they say,
no-brainer) to a technician, but not something you should attempt at home
without  expert  advice.  Techniques  like  this  occasioned  the  loss  of  many
millions of dollars in the Reagan Crash of 1987.

Changes and Developments in Technical Analysis

Have any new chart patterns (that is to say, changes in human behavior and
character)  emerged  since  the  5th  edition?  Not  to  my  knowledge,  although
there  are  those  who  take  the  same  data  and  draw  different  pictures  from
them.  How  else  could  you  say  that  you  had  something  new!  different!
better!?  There  are  other  ways  of  looking  at  the  data  which  are  interesting,
sometimes  valuable,  and  often  proﬁtable,  which  goes  to  prove  that  many
are  the  ways  and  gateless  is  the  gate  to  the  great  Dow.  Point  and  ﬁgure
charting have been used very effectively by traders I know, and candlestick
charting depicts data in interesting ways. Furthermore, since Magee’s time,
aided by the computer, technicians have developed innumerable, what I call,
number-driven technical analysis tools: (the puzzlingly named) stochastics,

 
 
 
 
 
 
AU3772_C000.fm  Page 12  Tuesday, November 21, 2006  1:50 PM

oscillators,  exponential  and  other  moving  averages,  etc.,  etc.,  etc.  It  is  not
the intent of this book to explore these tools in depth. That will be done in
a later volume. These concepts are brieﬂy explored in an appendix supplied
by Richard McDermott, editor of the 7th edition.

I have also made additions to the book (Chapter 18.1) to give a perspec-
tive on long-term investing, since Magee speciﬁcally addressed the second
part of the book (on tactics) to the speculator. I have substantially rewritten
Chapters  24  and  42  to  reﬂect  current  ideas  on  portfolio  management  and
risk  management.  I  have  expanded  on  the  idea  of  rhythmic  trading  —  an
idea  which  is  implicit  in  the  original.  I  have  expanded  the  treatment  of
runaway  markets  so  that  the  Internet  stocks  of  the  1990s  might  be  put  in
perspective (Chapter 23).

And then, paradigms. Paradigms, as everyone should know by now, are

the last refuge of a fundamentalist when all other explanations fail.

Paradigm Changes

Whenever  the  markets,  as  they  did  at  the  end  of  the  20th  century,  depart
from the commonly accepted algorithms for determining what their prices
ought to be, fundamentalists (those analysts and investors who believe they
can determine value from such ﬁxed verities as earnings, cash ﬂow, etc.) are
confronted with new paradigms. Are stock prices (values) to be determined
by dividing price by earnings to establish a reasonable price/earnings (p/e)
ratio? Or should sales be used, or cash ﬂow, or the phase of the moon, or —
in the late 1990s, should losses be multiplied by price to determine the value
of the stock? Technicians are not obliged to worry about this kind of ﬁnancial
legerdemain. The stock is worth what it can be sold for today in the market.

The Crystal Ball

Investors will get smarter and smarter, starting with those who learn what
this  book  has  to  say.  The  professionals  will  stay  one  step  ahead  of  them,
because  they  are  preternaturally  cunning  and  because  they  spend  all  their
time ﬁguring out how to keep ahead of the public, but the gap will narrow.
Software  and  hardware  will  continue  to  advance,  but  not  get  any  smarter.
Mechanical systems will work well in some areas, and not in others. Mechan-
ical  systems  are  only  as  good  as  the  engineer  who  designs  them  and  the
mechanic who maintains them. Buying systems is buying trouble. Everyone
should ﬁnd his own method (usually some variant of the Magee method, in
my opinion). All good things will end. All bad things will end. The bag of
tricks  with  which  the  insiders  bilk  the  public  will  get  smaller  and  smaller.
New and ingenious procedures will be developed by the insiders. The well
of human naiveté is bottomless. For every one educated, a new one will be
born in a New York minute. It is deeply disturbing at the turn of the century
that the owners of the NASDAQ and the NYSE should be thinking of going

 
 
 
 
 
 
AU3772_C000.fm  Page 13  Tuesday, November 21, 2006  1:50 PM

public. Could there be any more ominous sign that enormous changes are
about to occur?

Vigorous development of the systems, methods, procedures, and philos-
ophy outlined in this book is about the only protective shield I know of to
guard against inimical change.

About the Editorial Practices 
in This Eighth Edition

Needless  to  say,  one  approaches  the  revision  of  a  classic  work  with  some
trepidation.  Every  critic  and  reader  has  his  or  her  (cf.  Note  on  Gender)
opinion as to how revision should be done — whether the authors’ original
text  should  be  invisibly  changed  as  though  they  had  written  the  book  in
2000 instead of 1948 and were omniscient, or whether errors and anachro-
nisms  were  to  be  lovingly  preserved,  or  footnoted,  or…  etc.,  etc.  (I  have
preserved Magee’s favorite usage of “etc., etc., etc.” against the protestation
of generations of English composition teachers because I like its evocation
of an ever-expanding universe.)

Notwithstanding  every  reader’s  having  an  opinion,  I  am  certain  all
critics will be delighted with the practices followed in this 3rd millennium
edition of the most important book on technical analysis written in the 2nd
millennium.

Integrity of the Original Text

By  and  large,  the  5th  edition  has  been  the  source  of  the  authors’  original
text. Amazingly, almost no stylistic or clarifying emendation has been nec-
essary to that edition. This is a tribute to the clarity, style, and content of the
original  —  one  might  almost  say  awesome,  if  the  word  were  not  in  such
currency on “Saturday Night Live” and the “Comedy Channel.” Considering
that  it  was  written  in  the  middle  of  the  last  century,  and  considering  its
complex  subject,  and  considering  that  the  markets  were  one  tenth  of  their
present complexity, awesome may be the appropriate word. No change or
update has been necessary to the technical observations and analysis. They
are as deﬁnitive today as they were in 1950.

While I have preserved the authors’ original intent and text, I have taken
the  liberty  of  rearranging  some  of  the  chapters.  Novices  wishing  to  learn
manual charting will ﬁnd the appropriate chapters moved to appendices at
the back of the book, along with the chapters on Composite Leverage and
Sensitivity Indexes.

About Apparent Anachronisms

Critics with limited understanding of long-term trading success may think
that  discussions  of  “what  happened  in  1929”  or  “charts  of  ancient  history
from 1946” have no relevance to the markets of the present millennium. They
will point out that AT&T no longer exists in that form, that the New Haven

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AU3772_C000.fm  Page 16  Tuesday, November 21, 2006  1:50 PM

has  long  since  ceased  to  exist  as  a  stock,  that  many  charts  are  records  of
long-buried skeletons. This neglects the value of the charts as metaphor. It
ignores their representations of human behavior in the markets which will
be  replicated  tomorrow  in  some  stock  named  today.com  or  willtheynever-
getit.com.  Even  more  important,  it  ignores  the  signiﬁcance  of  the  past  to
trading in the present. I cite here material from Jack Schwager’s illuminating
book,  The  New  Wizards  of  Wall  Street.  Schwager,  in  conversation  with Al
Weiss: “Precisely how far back did you go in your chart studies?” Answer:
“It  varied  with  the  individual  market  and  the  available  charts.  In  the  case
of the grain markets, I was able to go back as far as the 1840s.” “Was it really
necessary to go back that far?” Answer: “Absolutely. One of the keys in long-
term chart analysis is realizing that markets behave differently in different
economic  cycles.  Recognizing  these  repeating  and  shifting  long-term  pat-
terns requires lots of history. Identifying where you are in an economic cycle
— say, an inﬂationary phase vs. a deﬂationary phase — is critical to inter-
preting the chart patterns evolving at that time.”

Identiﬁcation of Original Manuscript and Revisions

True believers (and skeptics) will ﬁnd here virtually all of the original mate-
rial written by Edwards and Magee, including their charts and observations
on them. Changes and comments introduced by editors since the 5th edition
have  been  rearranged,  and,  when  appropriate,  have  been  identiﬁed  as  a
revision by that editor.

Maintaining this policy, where updates to the present technological con-
text and market reality were necessary, the present editor has clearly iden-
tiﬁed them as his own work by beginning such annotations with “EN” for
Editor’s Note. Figure insertions are identiﬁed as “x.1, x.2.”

Absolutely Necessary Revisions

Not  too  long  ago  my  youngest  son,  Pancho,  overheard  a  conversation  in
which I referred to a slide rule. “What’s a slide rule, Dad?” he asked. Well,
needless to say the world has, in general, moved on from the time of Edwards
and Magee when instead of calculators we had slide rules. Where time has
made  the  text  useless,  moot,  or  irrelevant,  that  problem  has  unobtrusively
been corrected.

Where  the  passage  of  time  has  made  the  text  obsolete,  I  have  either
footnoted  the  anachronism  and/or  provided  a  chapter-ending  annotation.
These  annotations  are  marked  in  the  text  with  “EN”  also.  It  is  absolutely
essential  to  read  the  annotations.  Failure  to  do  so  will  leave  the  reader
stranded in the 20th century.

In some cases, these annotations amount to new chapters — for example,
trading directly in the averages was difﬁcult in Magee’s time. Nowadays if
there is not a proxy or option or index for some Index or Average or basket
of  stocks,  there  will  be  one  in  less  than  a  New  York  minute  (which,  as

 
 
 
 
 
 
AU3772_C000.fm  Page 17  Tuesday, November 21, 2006  1:50 PM

everyone knows, has only 59 seconds). This new reality has resulted in major
additions  to  this  new  edition.  These  are  detailed  in  the  Foreword.  Major
chapter  additions  necessary  to  deal  with  developments  in  technology  and
ﬁnance  theory  have  been  clearly  identiﬁed  as  this  editor’s  work  by  desig-
nating them as interpolations, viz., Chapter 18.1 (with the exception of Chap-
ter 23, which I have surreptitiously inserted).

Absolutely Necessary Revisions Which Will Have Arisen in 
the Thirty Minutes Since This Editorial Note Was Written

In a number of instances, the book relayed information which, in those days
of  ﬁxed  commissions  and  monopolistic  control  by  the  existing  exchanges,
remained valid for long periods of time, for instance, brokerage commissions
and trading costs. It is no longer possible to maintain such information in a
printed book because of the rate of change in the ﬁnancial industry. It must
now be ﬁled and updated in real time on the Internet. Consequently, readers
will  be  able  to  refer  to  the  Internet  for  this  kind  of  ephemeral  data.  The
general importance of the ephemera to the subject is always discussed.

About Gender

I quote here from my foreword to the 2nd edition of Magee’s General Seman-
tics of Wall Street, (charmingly renamed according to the current fashions,
Winning the Mental Game on Wall Street):

About Gender in Grammar

Ich bin ein feminist. How could any modern man, son
of  a  beloved  woman,  husband  of  an  adored  woman,
and father of a joyful and delightful daughter not be?
I am also a traditionalist and purist in matters of usage,
grammar, and style. So where does that leave me and
my cogenerationalists, enlightened literary (sigh) men
(and women) with regards to the use of the masculine
pronoun  when  used  in  the  general  sense  to  apply  to
the neuter situation?

In  Dictionary  of  Modern  American  Usage,  Garner
notes:  ‘English  has  a  number  of  common-sex  general
words, such as person, anyone, everyone, and no one,
but it has no common-sex singular personal pronouns.
Instead  we  have  he,  she,  and  it.  The  traditional
approach has been to use the masculine pronouns he
and him to cover all persons, male and female alike... .
The inadequacy of the English language in this respect
becomes  apparent  in  many  sentences  in  which  the
generic masculine pronoun sits uneasily.’

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AU3772_C000.fm  Page 18  Tuesday, November 21, 2006  1:50 PM

Inadequate or not it is preferable to s/he/it and other
bastardizations of the English language. (Is it not inter-
esting that “bastard,” in common usage, is never used
of a woman, even when she is illegitimate?) As for the
legitimacy of the usage of the masculine (actually neu-
ter) pronoun in the generic, I prefer to lean on Fowler,
who says, ‘There are three makeshifts: ﬁrst as anybody
can see for himself or herself; second, as anybody can
see for themselves; and third, as anybody can see for
himself. No one who can help it chooses the ﬁrst; it is
correct, and is sometimes necessary, but it is so clumsy
as to be ridiculous except when explicitness is urgent,
and it usually sounds like a bit of pedantic humor. The
second is the popular solution; it sets the literary man’s
(!) teeth on edge, and he exerts himself to give the same
meaning  in  some  entirely  different  way  if  he  is  not
prepared to risk the third, which is here recommended.
It involves the convention (statutory in the interpreta-
tion of documents) that where the matter of sex is not
conspicuous or important the masculine form shall be
allowed to represent a person instead of a man, or say
a man (homo) instead of a man (vir).’

Politically correct fanatics may rail, but so are my teeth
set  on  edge;  thus,  I  have  generally  preserved  the
authors’  usage  of  the  masculine  for  the  generic  case.
This grammatical scourge will pass and be forgotten,
and  weak-willed  myn  (by  which  I  intend  to  indicate
men and women) who pander to grammatical terror-
ists  will  in  the  future  be  seen  to  be  stuck  with  mal-
formed style and sentences no womyn will buy. What
would Jane Austen have done, after all?

About Gender in Investors

As long as we are on the subject of gender, we might
as  well  discuss,  unscientiﬁcally,  gender  in  investors.
Within  my  wide  experience  as  a  trading  advisor,
teacher,  and  counselor,  it  strikes  me  that  the  women
investors I have known have possessed certain innate
advantages  over  the  men.  I  know  there  are  women
gamblers. I have seen some. But I have never seen in
the  markets  a  woman  plunger  (shooter,  pyramider,
pie-eyed  gambler).  I  have  known  many  men  who  ﬁt

 
 
 
 
AU3772_C000.fm  Page 19  Tuesday, November 21, 2006  1:50 PM

this description. I have also noted among my students
and clients that as a group women seem to have more
patience than men as a group. I refer speciﬁcally to the
patience  that  a  wise  investor  must  have  to  allow  the
markets to do what they are going to do.
These are wholly personal observations. I have made
no study of the question and can’t speak to the entire
class  of  women  investors  —  and  do  not  personally
know Barbra Streisand (who I understand is a formi-
dable investor, especially in IPOs). But just as I believe
that the world would be better off if more women ran
countries  and  were  police  ofﬁcers,  I  expect  that  the
world of ﬁnance will beneﬁt from the steadily increas-
ing number of women investors and managers.

A Crucial Question — Sensitivity Indexes and Betas

Long before the investment community had formalized the beta measure —
the coefﬁcient measuring a stock’s volatility relative to the market — Magee
and  Edwards  were  computing  a  Sensitivity  Index,  which,  for  all  practical
purposes, was the same thing. Readers interested in this aspect of their work
may ﬁnd references in Resources which will enable them to obtain betas to
plug into the Composite Leverage formula with which Magee intended to
determine  risk  levels.  The  old  appendix  on  Sensitivity  Indexes  has  been
consigned to Appendix A, along with the chapter on Composite Leverage,
both  originals  of  which  have  been  emended  to  reﬂect  current  practices  in
ﬁnance theory and practice.

Betwixt and Between, 1/8 of a Dollar or 12.5 Cents

As this edition went to press the ﬁnancial services industry was once again
threatening  to  implement  decimals  in  stock  prices.  Pricing  in  eighths  has
endured long past its time because it was in the self-interest of the ﬁnancial
industry — it allowed brokers and market makers to enforce larger bid–ask
spreads and fatten their proﬁt margins. The importance for this book, and
for traders, is what will happen as full decimalization occurs. Often in these
pages,  Magee  will  recommend  placing  a  stop  1/8  off  the  low  or  high,  or
placing  progressive  near  stops  in  eighths.  We  do  not  yet  know  what  the
psychological interval will be in the new era. It may be 12.5 cents, or more
psychologically, 10 cents, or for gaming purposes, 9 or 11 cents. This remains
to be seen. As all the charts in this book are in the old notation that usage
has been preserved in this edition.

 
 
 
 
 
 
AU3772_C000.fm  Page 20  Tuesday, November 21, 2006  1:50 PM

The Editorial “I”

Readers  will  quickly  note  that  the  “Editorial  We”  of  Edwards  and  Magee
has been replaced by the ﬁrst person voice — or, the “Editorial I” or perhaps
the “Professorial I.” Well, there were two of Edwards and Magee, and there
is  only  one  of  me.  So  my  text  is  immediately  noticeable  as  mine,  and  the
reader  may  discriminate  quickly. As  for  the  use  of  “I”  as  an  expression  of
ego, the reader is assured that after 40 years in the market the editor has no
ego left to promote. Perhaps the best way to put the editor’s sense of impor-
tance  in  perspective  is  to  quote  Dr.  Johnson’s  deﬁnition  of  lexicographer
from his dictionary. Some people might have thought Johnson self-important
in  creating  the  ﬁrst  English  dictionary.  His  deﬁnition  of  his  trade  put  that
right.  “Lexicographer:  a  writer  of  dictionaries.  A  harmless  drudge.”  An
editor is something like the same.

As  this  book  goes  to  the  printer,  the  publisher,  recognizing  the  impor-
tance of the work done on this edition, will credit the Editor as co-author of
the 8th Edition. John Magee would be pleased. We had a cordial master–stu-
dent  relationship,  and  nothing  pleases  a  Zen  master  more  than  to  transfer
the dharma to a passionate student.

In Memoriam

This book is a memorial for John Magee, who died on June 17, 1987. John
Magee  was  considered  a  seminal  pioneer  in  technical  analysis,  and  his
research  with  co-author,  Robert  D.  Edwards,  clariﬁed  and  expanded  the
ideas of Charles Dow, who laid the foundation for technical analysis in 1884
by  developing  the  “Averages,”  and  Richard  Schabacker,  former  editor  of
Forbes in the 1920s, who showed how the signals, which had been considered
important  when  they  appeared  in  the  averages,  were  applicable  to  stocks
themselves.  The  text,  which  summarized  their  ﬁndings  in  1948,  was,  of
course, 
now considered the deﬁnitive work
on pattern recognition analysis. Throughout his technical work, John Magee
emphasized  three  principles:  stock  prices  tend  to  move  in  trends;  volume
goes with the trend; and a trend, once established, tends to continue in force.
  is  devoted  to  the
patterns which tend to develop when a trend is being reversed: Head-and-
Shoulders,  Tops  and  Bottoms,  “W”  patterns,  Triangles,  Rectangles,  etc.  —
common patterns to stock market technicians. Rounded Bottoms and Droop-
ing Necklines are some of the more esoteric ones.

Technical  Analysis  of  Stock  Trends

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, 

A  large  portion  of 

John urged investors to go with the trend, rather than trying to pick a
bottom before it was completed, averaging down a declining market. Above
all,  and  at  all  times,  he  refused  to  get  involved  in  the  game  of  forecasting
where “the market” was headed, or where the Dow–Jones Industrial aver-
ages  would  be  on  December  31st  of  the  coming  year.  Rather,  he  preached
care  in  individual  stock  selection  regardless  of  which  way  the  market
“appeared” to be headed.

To  the  random  walker,  who  once  confronted  John  with  the  statement
that  there  was  no  predictable  behavior  on  Wall  Street,  John’s  reply  was
classic. He said, “You fellows rely too heavily on your computers. The best
computer ever designed is still the human brain. Theoreticians try to simu-
late stock market behavior, and, failing to do so with any degree of predict-
ability,  declare  that  a  journey  through  the  stock  market  is  a  random  walk.
Isn’t it equally possible that the programs simply aren’t sensitive enough or
the  computers  strong  enough  to  successfully  simulate  the  thought  process
of the human brain?” Then John would walk over to his bin of charts, pull
out a favorite, and show it to the random walker. There it was — spike up,
heavy volume; consolidation, light volume; spike up again, heavy volume.
A third time. A fourth time. A beautifully symmetrical chart, moving ahead
in a well-deﬁned trend channel, volume moving with price. “Do you really
believe that these patterns are random?” John would ask, already knowing
the answer.

We all have a favorite passage or quotation by our favorite author. My
favorite quotation of John’s appears in the short booklet he wrote especially
for subscribers to his Technical Stock Advisory Service: “When you enter the
stock market, you are going into a competitive ﬁeld in which your evalua-
tions and opinions will be matched against some of the sharpest and toughest
minds  in  the  business.  You  are  in  a  highly  specialized  industry  in  which
there are many different sectors, all of which are under intense study by men
whose economic survival depends upon their best judgment. You will cer-
tainly be exposed to advice, suggestions, offers of help from all sides. Unless
you are able to develop some market philosophy of your own, you will not
be able to tell the good from the bad, the sound from the unsound.”

I  doubt  if  any  man  alive  has  helped  more  investors  develop  a  sound

philosophy of investing on Wall Street than John Magee.

Preface to the Seventh Edition

More  than  100  years  ago,  in  Springﬁeld,  MA,  there  lived  a  man  named
Charles  H.  Dow.  He  was  one  of  the  editors  of  a  great  newspaper,  The
Springﬁeld Republican. When he left Springﬁeld, it was to establish another
great newspaper, The Wall Street Journal.

Charles Dow also laid the foundation for a new approach to stock market

problems.

In 1884, he made up an average of the daily closing prices of 11 important
stocks, 9 of which were rails, and recorded the ﬂuctuations of this average.
He believed that the judgment of the investing public, as reﬂected in the
movements  of  stock  prices,  represented  an  evaluation  of  the  future  proba-
bilities  affecting  the  various  industries.  He  saw  in  his  average  a  tool  for
predicting business conditions many months ahead. This was true because
those  who  bought  and  sold  these  stocks  included  people  intimately
acquainted  with  the  industrial  situation  from  every  angle.  Dow  reasoned
that  the  price  of  a  security,  as  determined  by  a  free  competitive  market,
represented the composite knowledge and appraisal of everyone interested
in that security — ﬁnanciers, ofﬁcers of the company, investors, employees,
customers — everyone, in fact, who might be buying or selling stock.

Dow  felt  that  this  market  evaluation  was  probably  the  shrewdest
appraisal of conditions to come that could be contained, since it integrated
all known facts, estimates, surmises, and the hopes and fears of all interested
parties.

It  was  William  Peter  Hamilton  who  really  put  these  ideas  to  work.  In
his book, The Stock Market Barometer, published in 1922, he laid the ground-
work for the much-used and much-abused Dow Theory.

Unfortunately,  a  great  many  superﬁcial  students  of  the  market  never
understood the original premise of the “barometer” and seized on the bare
bones of the theory as a sort of magic touchstone to fame and easy fortune.
Others,  discovering  that  the  “barometer”  was  not  perfect,  set  about
devising  corrections.  They  tinkered  with  the  rules  of  classic  Dow  Theory,
trying  to  ﬁnd  the  wonderful  formula  that  would  avoid  its  periodic  disap-
pointments and failures.

Of course, what they forgot was that the Averages were only averages
at best. There is nothing very wrong with the Dow Theory. What is wrong
is the attempt to ﬁnd a simple, universal formula — a set of measurements
that will make a suit to ﬁt every man, fat, thin, tall, or short.

During the 1920s and 1930s, Richard W. Schabacker reopened the subject
of technical analysis in a somewhat new direction. Schabacker, who had been
ﬁnancial editor of Forbes Magazine, set out to ﬁnd some new answers. He
realized that whatever signiﬁcant action appeared in the average must derive
from similar action in some of the stocks making up the average.

 
 
 
AU3772_C000.fm  Page 26  Tuesday, November 21, 2006  1:50 PM

In his books, Stock Market Theory and Practice, Technical Market Anal-
ysis,  and  Stock  Market  Proﬁts,  Schabacker  showed  how  the  “signals”  that
had been considered important by Dow theorists when they appeared in the
Averages were also signiﬁcant and had the same meanings when they turned
up in the charts of individual stocks.

Others, too, had noted these technical patterns. But, it was Schabacker
who collated, organized, and systematized the technical method. Not only
that,  he  also  discovered  new  technical  indications  in  the  charts  of  stocks;
indications of a type that would ordinarily be absorbed or smothered in the
averages, and, hence, not visible or useful to Dow theorists.

In  the  ﬁnal  years  of  his  life,  Richard  Schabacker  was  joined  by  his
brother-in-law, Robert D. Edwards, who completed Schabacker’s last book
and carried forward the research of technical analysis.

Edwards, in turn, was joined in this work in 1942 by John Magee. Magee,
an alumnus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was well oriented
to the scientiﬁc and technical approach.

Edwards  and  Magee  retraced  the  entire  road,  reexamining  the  Dow

Theory and restudying the technical discoveries of Schabacker.

Basically, the original ﬁndings were still good. But with additional his-
tory and experience, it was possible to correct some details of earlier studies.
Also, a number of new applications and methods were brought to light. The
entire process of technical evaluation became more scientiﬁc.

It  became  possible  to  state  more  precisely  the  premises  of  technical
analysis:  that  the  market  represents  a  most  democratic  and  representative
criterion  of  stock  values;  that  the  action  of  a  stock  in  a  free,  competitive
market reﬂects all that is known, believed, surmised, hoped, or feared about
that  stock;  and,  therefore,  that  it  synthesizes  the  attitudes  and  opinions  of
all.  That  the  price  of  a  stock  is  the  result  of  buying  and  selling  forces  and
represents the “true value” at any given moment. That a Major Trend must
be presumed to continue in effect until clear evidence of Reversal is shown.
And,  ﬁnally,  that  it  is  possible  to  form  opinions  having  a  reasonably  high
probability  of  conﬁrmation  from  the  market  action  of  a  stock  as  shown  in
daily,  weekly,  or  monthly  charts,  or  from  other  technical  studies  derived
from the market activity of the security.

It is important to point out that the ultimate value of a security to the
investor  or  trader  is  what  he  or  she  ultimately  receives  from  it.  That  is  to
say, the price the investor gets when it is sold, or the market price obtainable
for  it  at  any  particular  time,  adjusted  for  dividends  or  capital  distribution
in either case. If, for example, he or she has bought a stock at $25 a share,
and it has paid $5 in dividends and is now bid at $35, he or she has realized
an  accrued  beneﬁt  of  $5  plus  $10,  or  $15  in  all.  It  is  the  combination  of
dividends and appreciation of capital that constitutes the total gain.

It seems futile to try to correlate or compare the market value of a stock
with the “book value” or with the “value” ﬁgured on a basis of capitalized
earnings  or  dividends,  projected  growth,  etc.  There  are  too  many  other
factors  that  may  also  affect  the  value,  and  some  of  these  cannot  easily  be

 
 
AU3772_C000.fm  Page 27  Tuesday, November 21, 2006  1:50 PM

expressed in simple ratios. For example, a struggle for control of a corpora-
tion can as surely increase the value of its securities in the market as a growth
of earnings. Again, a company may lose money for years and pay no divi-
dends,  yet  still  be  an  excellent  investment  on  the  basis  of  its  development
of potential resources as perceived by those who are buying and selling its
stock. For the market is not evaluating last year’s accomplishments as such,
it is weighing the prospects for the year to come.

Then, too, in a time of inﬂation, a majority of stocks may advance sharply
in price. This may reﬂect a depreciation in the purchasing power of dollars
more than improvement in business conditions — but it is important, none-
theless, in such a case to be “out of dollars” and “into” equities.

As  a  result  of  their  research  from  1942  to  1948,  Edwards  and  Magee
developed new technical methods. They put these methods to practical use
in  actual  market  operation.  And,  eventually,  in  1948,  these  ﬁndings  were
published in their deﬁnitive book, Technical Analysis of Stock Trends.

This book, now in its seventh edition, has become the accepted authority
in this ﬁeld. It has been used as a textbook by various schools and colleges,
and is the basic tool of many investors and traders.

In  1951,  Edwards  retired  from  his  work  as  a  stock  analyst  and  John
Magee continued the research, at ﬁrst, independently, and then from January
1953 to March 1956 as Chief Technical Analyst with an investment counseling
ﬁrm.

Meanwhile, beginning in 1950, Magee started on a new road, which, as
it  turned  out,  was  destined  to  open  up  virgin  ﬁelds  of  technical  market
research.

Using  the  methods  of  Dow,  Hamilton,  Schabacker,  and  Edwards  as  a
base,  he  initiated  a  series  of  studies  intended  to  discover  new  technical
devices. These investigations were long and laborious, and, often, they were
fruitless.  One  study  required  four  months  of  work,  involved  hundreds  of
sheets of tabulations, many thousands of computations, and proved nothing.
But from this type of work, eventually in late 1951, there began to emerge
some  important  new  and  useful  concepts  —  new  bricks  to  build  into  the
structure of the technical method.

The  new  devices  are  not  revolutionary.  They  do  not  vitiate  the  basic
technical approach. Rather, they are evolutionary and add something to the
valuable kit of tools already at hand. The new studies often make it possible
to interpret and predict difﬁcult situations sooner and more dependably than
any other method previously used.

Mr. Magee has designated these newest technical devices the Delta Stud-
ies. They are basically an extension and reﬁnement of the technical method.
There  is  no  magic  in  the  Delta  Studies.  They  do  not  provide  infallible  for-
mulas for sure proﬁts at all times in every transaction, but they have proved
eminently successful over a period of years in practical use in actual market
Technical
operations,  as  an  auxiliary  to  the  methods  outlined  in  the  book, 
Analysis of Stock Trends.

Through his technical work, John Magee emphasized these three prin-

ciples:

1. Stock prices tend to move in trends.
2. Volume goes with the trends.
3. A trend, once established, tends to continue in force.

A  large  portion  of  the  book,  Technical  Analysis  of  Stock  Trends,  is
devoted to the patterns that tend to develop when a trend is being reversed.
Head-and-Shoulders,  Tops  and  Bottoms,  “W”  Patterns,  Triangles,  Rectan-
gles,  etc.,  are  common  patterns  to  stock  market  technicians.  Rounded  Bot-
toms and Drooping Necklines are some of the more esoteric ones.

Magee urged investors to go with the trend, rather than trying to pick
a Bottom before it was completed, or averaging down in a declining stock.
Above all, and at all times, he refused to get involved in the game of fore-
casting  where  “the  market”  was  headed,  or  where  the  DJIA  would  be  on
December  31st  of  the  coming  year.  Rather,  he  preached  care  in  individual
stock  selection  regardless  of  which  way  the  market  “appeared”  headed.
Finally, his service recommended short positions as regularly as it did long
positions, based simply on what the charts said.

Preface to the Fifth Edition

During the 16 printings of the fourth edition of Technical Analysis of Stock
Trends, very few changes have been made in the original text, mainly because
the lucid presentation of market action by the late Robert D. Edwards cov-
ered  so  thoroughly  the  basic  and  typical  market  action  of  common  stocks.
There  has  seemed  no  reason,  for  example,  to  discard  a  chart  picture  illus-
trating  some  important  technical  phenomenon  merely  because  it  occurred
several or many years ago.

Instead, over the various printings of the book, pages have been added
showing  similar  examples,  or  in  some  cases  entirely  new  types  of  market
action  taken  from  recent  history;  but  these  demonstrate  mainly  that  the
inherent  nature  of  a  competitive  market  does  not  change  very  much  over
the years, and that “the same old patterns” of human behavior continue to
produce much the same types of market trends and ﬂuctuations.

The principal change in this ﬁfth edition, and it is a spectacular improve-
ment, is that practically all of the chart examples drawn to the TEKNIPLAT
scale have been redrawn and new plates of these have been substituted. In
the  course  of  this  work,  several  minor  errors  of  scaling,  titling,  etc.,  previ-
ously undiscovered, came to light and have been corrected.

The difﬁcult work of revision was initiated in our charting room by two
ambitious teenagers, Anne E. Mahoney and Joseph J. Spezeski, who took on
the  entire  job  of  preparing  the  ﬁnished  drawings  and  making  necessary
corrections. This enormous project was undertaken and carried through by
these two young people spontaneously. In order to free them entirely from
other distractions, their regular charting work was taken over for a period
of months by the rest of the chartroom staff, so that a great deal of credit is
due to the ﬁne efforts of the entire chartroom group.

Preface to the Fourth Edition

In the several years since publication of the ﬁrst edition of this work, “the
stock market goes right on repeating the same old movements in much the
same  old  routine.”  Nearly  all  of  the  technical  phenomena  outlined  in  the
ﬁrst edition have appeared many times since then, and we see no reason to
expect that these habits of stocks will change materially in the years ahead,
barring  revolutionary  changes  in  the  economy,  such  as  the  abolishment  of
the free market entirely.

Since the basic nature of the market has not changed appreciably, it has
been  unnecessary  to  make  sweeping  alterations  in  the  text  of  Part  One:
Technical  Theory.  The  previous  edition  has  been  very  carefully  restudied,
and  revisions  have  been  made  where  they  were  called  for  to  bring  the
material  up  to  date.  In  Part  Two:  Trading  Tactics,  more  extensive  changes
were  needed,  due  to  the  more  speciﬁc  nature  of  the  material  and  some
differences in the present margin requirements, trading rules, etc. Also, there
have  been  some  improvements  in  the  application  of  technical  methods  at
the tactical level, and these have been incorporated in this section.

Somewhat  less  emphasis  has  been  put  on  the  use  of  stop-loss  orders,
since  their  need  is  not  so  great  in  the  case  of  the  experienced  trader  as  it
might be with the novice. The principle of always following the Major Trend
has  been  modiﬁed  to  achieve  better  protection  of  capital  through  balance
and  diversiﬁcation.  In  line  with  avoiding  “all-out”  situations,  with  their
consequent dangers, the idea of using an Evaluative Index has been intro-
duced, and this concept has modiﬁed somewhat the tactics of following the
Major  Trend.  It  also  has  a  bearing  on  the  Composite  Leverage  or  determi-
nation of total risk.

Type  for  the  entire  book  has  been  reset  in  this  edition.  The  illustrative
charts originally used have been, in the main, retained, since they demon-
strate the various points very well, but a new chapter includes a number of
additional  charts  taken  from  the  market  history  of  recent  years,  showing
how the same phenomena continue to appear again and again.

The  appendix  on  the  Sensitivity  Indexes  has  been  completely  recom-
puted, and extended to cover a broad list of the more important issues. The
arduous labor of determining these index ﬁgures was undertaken by Frank
J. Curto and Marcella P. Curto. Material help in proofreading and revision
for this edition was given by Beverly Magee and Elinor T. Magee.

Preface to the Second Edition

It is, needless to say, gratifying to the authors of this treatise to report that
not only has a large ﬁrst edition been exhausted (although it was originally
assumed that it would sufﬁce for many years), but also that the demand for
copies  has  been  increasing  at  a  rather  astonishing  pace  during  the  past  6
months  without  any  “promotion”  except  word-of-mouth  recommendation
from one investor to another.

In preparing this new edition, a careful perusal of everything that was
written in the previous printing, checked by the market events of the past
24 months and compared with all of the additional chart data accumulated
during that period, resulted in the not unexpected, but nevertheless mildly
surprising conclusion that nothing whatever of real consequence needed to
be changed or ampliﬁed. Hence, only minor revisions of an editorial nature
have been made.

It would have been interesting to augment our already copious illustra-
tions  with  a  number  of  charts  from  current  months  of  market  action,  but
costs of engraving and printing have risen to such a distressingly high level
that any additions of that sort would, it was found, be prohibitively expen-
sive.  Aside  from  their  novelty,  they  would  add  nothing  to  the  book;  they
would only be substituted for other charts of precisely the same nature and
signiﬁcance, and fully as pertinent to present-day conditions.

The  stock  market,  as  I  wrote  in  the  original  Foreword,  “goes  right  on
repeating  the  same  old  movements  in  much  the  same  old  routine.  The
importance of a knowledge of these phenomena to the trader and investor
has  been  in  no  whit  diminished.”  We  see  the  same  forecasting  patterns
developing on the charts today that we have seen over and over again for
the past twenty years. Neither the mechanics nor the “human element” of
the stock market has changed, and there is no reason to think that they will.

Foreword

This  book  has  been  written  for  the  layman  rather  than  for  the  Wall  Street
professional. But, it assumes that the reader is already possessed of at least
an elementary knowledge of the nature of stocks and bonds, that he has had
some dealings with a broker and some familiarity with the ﬁnancial pages
of  his  newspapers.  Hence,  no  attempt  is  made  herein  to  deﬁne  common
stock market terms and procedures. Every effort, however, has been exerted
to explain, in full, the theories and the terminology of our speciﬁc subject,
technical market analysis.

Part One is based, in large part, on the pioneer researches and writings
of  the  late  Richard  W.  Schabacker.  Students  of  his  Technical  Analysis  and
Stock  Market  Proﬁts  (the  latest  revision  of  which  is  now  out  of  print  was
made in 1937 by the present writer and Albert L. Kimball) will ﬁnd in the
pages of this section much that is familiar and, except for the illustrations,
only a little that is really novel. It has been a matter of surprise, in fact, to
the authors and other students of market technics that all the new controls
and regulations of the past several years, the new taxes which have placed
a  heavy  handicap  on  successful  investors,  the  greatly  augmented  and
improved facilities for acquiring dependable information on securities, even
the quite radical changes in certain portions of our basic economy, have not
much altered the “pattern” of the stock market.

Certain of the evidences of pool manipulation which used to appear on
the charts are now seldom seen. A few of the price formations which formerly
were  quite  common,  now  appear  rarely  or  may  have  lost  much  of  their
practical utility for the trader; they have been omitted from this text. Others
have altered their habits slightly, or their consequences to a degree (but not
their  fundamental  nature),  which  has,  of  course,  been  noted  herein.  The
distressing thinness of the market at times — one of the undoubted effects
of  regulation  —  has  resulted  in  a  few  more  “false  moves,”  more  spells  of
uninteresting (and unproﬁtable) inactivity. But, in the main, the market goes
right on repeating the same old movements in much the same old routine.
The importance of a knowledge of these phenomena to the trader and inves-
tor has been in no whit diminished.

Part Two, which has to do with the practical application of these market
patterns  and  phenomena,  with  the  tactics  of  trading,  is  all  new.  For  more
than  15  years  (his  total  market  experience  extends  back  nearly  30  years),
John  Magee  has  invested  and  traded  exclusively  via  the  technical  theory,
kept thousands of charts, made hundreds of actual trades, tested all sorts of
applications, audited and analyzed methods, tactics, and results from every
conceivable  angle,  depended  on  his  proﬁts  for  his  living.  His  contribution
is that of one who has tried and knows.

It may well be added here — and will be often repeated in the following
pages  —  that  the  technical  guides  to  trading  in  stocks  are  by  no  means
infallible.  The  more  experience  one  gains  in  their  use,  the  more  alive  one
becomes to their pitfalls and their failures. There is no such thing as a sure-
ﬁre method of “beating the market”; the authors have no hesitancy in saying
that there never will be. Nevertheless, a knowledge and judicious application
of the principles of technical analysis does pay dividends — is more proﬁt-
able (and far safer) for the average investor than any other of the presently
recognized and established approaches to the problems of buying and selling
securities.

The Technical Approach 
to Trading and Investing

Few  human  activities  have  been  so  exhaustively  studied  during  the  past
century, from so many angles and by so many different sorts of people, as
has  the  buying  and  selling  of  corporate  securities.  The  rewards  which  the
stock market holds out to those who read it right are enormous; the penalties
it  exacts  from  careless,  dozing,  or  “unlucky”  investors  are  calamitous.  No
wonder  it  has  attracted  some  of  the  world’s  most  astute  accountants,  ana-
lysts, and researchers, along with a motley crew of eccentrics, mystics, and
“hunch players,” and a multitude of just ordinary hopeful citizens.

  and 

Able brains have sought, and continue constantly to seek, for safe and
sure methods of appraising the state and trend of the market, of discovering
the  right  stock  to  buy  and  the  right  time  to  buy  it.  This  intensive  research
has  not  been  fruitless  —  far  from  it.  There  are  a  great  many  successful
investors and speculators (using the word in its true sense, which is without
opprobrium)  who,  by  one  road  or  another,  have  acquired  the  necessary
insight  into  the  forces  with  which  they  deal  and  the  judgment,  the  fore-
thought, and the all important self-discipline to deal with them proﬁtably.
In the course of years of stock market study, two quite distinct schools
of  thought  have  arisen,  two  radically  different  methods  of  arriving  at  the

answers  to  the  trader’s  problem  of

technical

has  made  rapid  progress  and,  although  still  beset  by  a  “lunatic  fringe,”  it
promises to contribute a great deal to our understanding of economic trends.)
The stock market fundamentalist depends on statistics. He examines the
auditors’ reports, the proﬁt-and-loss statements, the quarterly balance sheets,
the  dividend  records,  and  policies  of  the  companies  whose  shares  he  has
under observation. He analyzes sales data, managerial ability, plant capacity,
the competition. He turns to bank and treasury reports, production indexes,
price statistics, and crop forecasts to gauge the state of business in general,
and reads the daily news carefully to arrive at an estimate of future business
conditions. Taking all these into account, he evaluates his stock; if it is selling

while this is an excellent way to buy companies it is not a very good way to buy
stocks.)

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

As  a  matter  of  fact,  aside  from  the  greenest  of  newcomers  when  they
ﬁrst tackle the investment problem, and to whom, in their inexperience, any
other  point  of  view  is  not  only  irrational  but  incomprehensible,  your  pure
fundamentalist is a very rare bird. Even those market authorities who pre-
tend to scorn charts and “chartists” utterly are not oblivious to the “action”
chronicled by the ticker tape, nor do they conceal their respect for the Dow
Theory which, whether they realize it or not, is, in its very essence, purely
technical.

Deﬁnition of Technical Analysis

The term “technical,” in its application to the stock market, has come to have
a very special meaning, quite different from its ordinary dictionary deﬁni-
the  study  of  the  action  of  the  market  itself
tion.  It  refers  to 
  as  opposed  to  the
study of the goods in which the market deals. 
 is the science
of  recording,  usually  in  graphic  form,  the  actual  history  of  trading  (price
changes, volume of transactions, etc.) in a certain stock or in “the Averages”
and  then  deducing  from  that  pictured  history  the  probable  future  trend.
EN: With the advent of the computer, many schools of technical analysis have arisen.
Number-driven  technical  analysis,  e.g.,  moving  average  studies  oscillators,  etc.,
attempts to completely objectify the analysis of the markets. The work of Edwards
and Magee is the embodiment and deﬁnition of “classical technical analysis.” See
Appendix C.

Technical Analysis

The technical student argues thus: it is futile to assign an intrinsic value
to a stock certiﬁcate. One share of United States Steel, for example, was worth
$261  in  the  early  fall  of  1929,  but  you  could  buy  it  for  only  $22  in  June  of
1932! By March 1937, it was selling for $126 and just 1 year later for $38. In
May  of  1946,  it  had  climbed  back  up  to  $97,  and  10 months  later,  in  1947,
had dropped below $70, although the company’s earnings on this last date
were  reputed  to  be  nearing  an  all-time  high  and  interest  rates  in  general
were  still  near  an  all-time  low.  The  book  value  of  this  share  of  U.S.  Steel,
according to the corporation’s balance sheet, was about $204 in 1929 (end of
the  year);  $187  in  1932;  $151  in  1937;  $117  in  1938,  and  $142  in  1946.  This
sort of thing, this wide divergence between presumed value and actual price,
is not the exception; it is the rule. It is going on all the time. The fact is that
the  real  value  of  a  share  of  U.S.  Steel  common  is  determined  at  any  given
time  solely,  deﬁnitely,  and  inexorably  by  supply  and  demand,  which  are
accurately reﬂected in the transactions consummated on the ﬂoor of the New
York Stock Exchange.

Of course, the statistics which the fundamentalists study play a part in
the supply–demand equation — that is freely admitted. But there are many
other  factors  affecting  it.  The  market  price  reﬂects  not  only  the  differing
value opinions of many orthodox security appraisers, but also all the hopes
and  fears  and  guesses  and  moods,  rational  and  irrational,  of  hundreds  of
potential buyers and sellers, as well as their needs and their resources — in
total, factors which defy analysis and for which no statistics are obtainable,

ﬁgure that counts.

Moreover,  the  technician  claims,  with  complete  justiﬁcation,  that  the

already  out  of  date  and  sterile,  because  the  market  is  not  interested  in  the

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

past  or  even  in  the  present!  It  is  constantly  looking  ahead,  attempting  to
discount future developments, weighing and balancing all the estimates and
guesses  of  hundreds  of  investors  who  look  into  the  future  from  different
points of view and through glasses of many different hues. In brief, the going
price, as established by the market itself, comprehends all the fundamental
information which the statistical analyst can hope to learn (plus some that
is  perhaps  secret  from  him,  known  only  to  a  few  insiders)  and  much  else
besides of equal or even greater importance.

All of which, admitting its truth, would be of little signiﬁcance were it
not  for  the  fact,  which  no  one  of  experience  doubts,  that  prices  move  in
trends and trends tend to continue until something happens to change the
supply–demand balance. Such changes are usually detectable in the action
of the market itself. Certain patterns or formations, levels or areas, appear
on  the  charts  which  have  a  meaning,  and  can  be  interpreted  in  terms  of
probable future trend development. They are not infallible, it must be noted,
but the odds are deﬁnitely in their favor. Time after time, as experience has
amply proved, they are far more prescient than the best-informed and most
shrewd of statisticians.

The technical analyst may go even further in his claims. He may offer
to interpret the chart of a stock whose name he does not know, so long as
the  record  of  trading  is  accurate  and  covers  a  long  enough  term  to  enable
him  to  study  its  market  background  and  habits.  He  may  suggest  that  he
could trade with proﬁt in a stock knowing only its ticker symbol, completely
ignorant of the company, the industry, what it manufactures or sells, or how
it  is  capitalized.  Needless  to  say,  such  practice  is  not  recommended,  but  if
your  market  technician  is  really  experienced  at  his  business,  he  could,  in
theory, do exactly what he claims.

Should the reader, at this point, ﬁnd the technical approach to trading
or  investing,  as  explained  in  the  foregoing,  completely  abhorrent,  perhaps
he had better close the book now. For it is primarily the technical approach,
the science of technical analysis, with which the remainder of the book deals.

EN: The Elliott Wave Theory: Perspective and Comments* 

This  week  we  had  the  pleasure  of  attending  the  December  meeting  of  the  Market
Technicians Association of New York.

Long-term subscribers will remember the MTANY as the organization which
honored John Magee with its “Man of the Year” award in 1978. The speaker was
Robert Prechter, publisher of “The Elliott Wave Theorist,” an investment advisory
which  bases  its  forecasts  on  interpretations  of  R.N.  Elliott’s  work  on  the  stock
market.…

Of primary interest to SAS subscribers are Prechter’s comments on technical
analysis itself. The Elliott Wave Theory, it must be remembered, is really no more
than a “catalog” of stock market price movements, laid one on top of the other, so

to speak, until a grand, underlying, and enduring pattern is observed; in short, pure
technical analysis. Among Prechter’s deﬁnitions and observations regarding funda-
mental analysis are the following:

1. “First  let’s  deﬁne  ‘technical’  versus  ‘fundamental’  data…technical  data  is

that which is generated by the action of the market under study.”

2. “The  main  problem  with  fundamental  analysis  is  that  its  indicators  are
removed  from  the  market  itself.  The  analyst  assumes  causality  between
external events and market movements, a concept which is almost certainly
false.  But,  just  as  important,  and  less  recognized,  is  that  fundamental
analysis  almost  always  requires  a  forecast  of  the  fundamental  data  itself
before conclusions about the market are drawn. The analyst is then forced
to take a second step in coming to a conclusion about how those forecasted
events will affect the markets! Technicians only have one step to take, which
gives them an edge right off the bat. Their main advantage is that they don’t
have to forecast their indicators.”

3. “What’s worse, even the fundamentalists’ second step is probably a process
built on quicksand.… The most common application of fundamental anal-
ysis is estimating companies’ earnings for both the current year and next
year, and recommending stocks on that basis.… And the record on that basis
alone is very poor, as Barron’s pointed out in a June 4 article, which showed
that earnings estimates averaged 18% error in the 30 DJIA stocks for any
year already completed and 54% error for the year ahead. The weakest link,
however,  is  the  assumption  that  correct  earnings  estimates  are  a  basis  for
choosing stock market winners. According to a table in the same Barron’s
article,  a  purchase  of  the  10  DJIA  stocks  with  the  best  earnings  estimates
would have produced a 10-year cumulative gain of 40.5%, while choosing
the  10  DJIA  with  the  worst  earnings  estimates  would  have  produced  a
whopping 142.5% gain.”

We enjoyed Prechter’s polished exposition of a technical approach different from
our own. As for his observations about fundamental analysis, we simply couldn’t
agree more.

Charts

Charts are the working tools of the technical analyst. They have been devel-
oped  in  a  multitude  of  forms  and  styles  to  represent  graphically  almost
anything and everything that takes place in the market, or to plot an “index”
derived therefrom. They may be monthly charts on which an entire month’s
trading  record  is  condensed  into  a  single  entry,  or  weekly,  daily,  hourly,
transaction,  “point-and-ﬁgure,”  candlestick,  etc.  They  may  be  constructed
on arithmetic, logarithmic, or square-root scale, or projected as “oscillators.”
They may delineate moving averages, proportion of trading volume to price
movement, average price of “most active” issues, odd-lot transactions, the
short interest, and an inﬁnitude of other relations, ratios, and indexes — all
technical in the sense that they are derived, directly or indirectly, from what
has actually been transacted on the exchanges.

With most of these, fortunately, we shall not need to concern ourselves
at  all;  they  are  of  interest  only  to  the  full-time  economic  analyst.  Many  of
them  have  derived  from  a  completely  futile  (so  far,  at  least)  endeavor  to
discover some one “mechanical” index or combination of indexes which will
always, automatically, without ever failing or going wrong, give warning of
a change in trend; such, in our experience, are often confusing and sometimes
downright  deceptive  at  a  most  critical  juncture.  This  book,  however,  is
designed for the layman, the business or professional man who cannot spend
all  his  hours  on  his  investing  or  trading  operations,  but  to  whom  these
operations are, nevertheless, of sufﬁcient importance or interest to warrant
his devoting at least a few minutes a day to their study and management.
(EN9: In retropsect an underestimation of the importance of the work. In the 21st
century the best professionals are acutely aware of the importance of trend analysis
and use this work as their text book.)
 The theories and methods outlined herein
will  require  only  the  simplest  form  of  stock  chart  —  a  record  of  the  price
range (high and low), closing price, and volume of shares traded each day.
These  daily  graphs  will  be  supplemented,  for  certain  purposes  which  will
be discussed farther on, by weekly or monthly charts, which for most stocks
can be purchased ready-made and which are easily generated by almost all
commercially available investment software.

Nearly all the illustrations throughout the following pages are examples
of such daily charts. They are easy to make and maintain manually, requiring
only a supply of graph or cross-section paper (almost any kind can serve),
a daily newspaper which gives full and accurate reports on stock exchange

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

EN: Alternatively, numer-
dealings, a sharp pencil, and a few minutes of time. 
ous  data  services  are  available  for  use  with  computer  software  packages,  not  to
mention Internet sites (which are mentioned in Resources). The use of this technol-
ogy eliminates the burden of manual chart keeping altogether. If there is a drawback
to  this  technology  it  might  be  in  the  loss  of  the  “feel”  the  investor  gets  through
manual charting.

It is customary in preparing ordinary daily stock charts to let the hori-
zontal  axis  represent  time,  with  the  vertical  cross-lines  (or  as  some  prefer,
the spaces between them) from left to right thus standing for successive days.
The  vertical  scale  is  used  for  prices,  with  each  horizontal  cross-line  then
representing a speciﬁc price level. Space is usually provided at the bottom
of the sheet to plot volume, i.e., the number of shares which change hands
each  day.  The  newspapers  publishing  complete  stock  market  reports  give
the day’s turnover or volume (exclusive of odd-lot transactions which may
for  our  present  purpose  be  disregarded),  the  highest  and  lowest  price  at
which each stock sold during the day, the closing price (which is the price
at  which  the  last  sale  effected  during  the  day  was  made),  and  usually  the
opening or ﬁrst sale price. On our charts, the daily price range is plotted by
drawing a vertical line connecting the points representing the high and the
low. Then a short horizontal “tick” is added, either crossing the vertical range
line  or  extending  out  to  the  right  from  it,  at  the  level  of  the  closing  price.
Sometimes all transactions in a stock during a day take place at one and the
same price; the high, low, and close are thus all on a level and the only mark
on our chart will then be the horizontal dash representing the closing ﬁgure.
Volume is depicted by drawing a vertical line up from the base line of the
chart.

The opening price need not be recorded.*

Experience has shown that it
seldom,  if  ever,  has  any  signiﬁcance  in  estimating  future  developments,
which is all that ordinarily should interest us. The closing price is important,
however.  It  is,  in  fact,  the  only  price  which  many  casual  readers  of  the
ﬁnancial  pages  ever  look  at.  It  represents  the  ﬁnal  evaluation  of  the  stock
made by the market during the day. It may, of course, be registered in the
ﬁrst hour of trading, provided no other sales are subsequently effected, but,
it  becomes,  nevertheless,  the  ﬁgure  upon  which  a  majority  of  prospective
traders  base  their  plans  for  the  following  day.  Hence,  its  technical  signiﬁ-
cance, which will appear in various contexts in later chapters.

Different Types of Scales

Many  speciﬁc  suggestions  as  to  the  details  of  charting  are  deferred  for
discussion in the second section of this book, but there is one chart feature
which may well be considered here. Until recent years, nearly all stock price

* EN: Edwards considered the opening price unimportant. Some technicians, myself included, do observe
it to be of use. And in some charting systems it is indispensable, for example, candlestick charting where
it is accorded enormous importance.

charts were kept on the common form of graph paper ruled to what is known
as plain or arithmetic scale. But more and more chartists have now come to
use what is known as semilogarithmic paper, or sometimes as ratio or per-
centage paper. Our own experience indicates that the semilogarithmic scale
has deﬁnite advantages in this work; most of the charts reproduced in this
book employ it. The two types of scale may be distinguished at a glance by
the fact that on arithmetic paper, equal distances on the vertical scale (i.e.,
between  horizontal  lines)  represent  equal  amounts  in  dollars,  whereas  on
the semilogarithmic paper, they represent equal percentage changes. Thus,
on arithmetic paper the distance between 10 and 20 on the vertical scale is
exactly the same as that from 20 to 30 and from 30 to 40. On the logarithmic
scale  the  difference  from  10  to  20,  representing  an  increase  of  100%,  is  the
same as that from 20 to 40 or from 40 to 80, in each case representing another
100% increase.

Percentage relations, it goes without saying, are important in trading in
securities. The semilogarithmic scale permits direct comparison of high- and
low-priced stocks and makes it easier to choose the one offering the greater
(percentage)  proﬁt  on  the  funds  to  be  invested.  It  facilitates  the  placing  of
stop-loss orders. Area patterns appear much the same on either type of paper
but  certain  trendlines  develop  more  advantageously  on  the  ratio  scale.
Almost anyone can quickly become accustomed to making entries on semi-
logarithmic paper. We recommend its use. However, its advantages are not
so  great  as  to  require  one  to  change,  one  who,  because  of  long  familiarity
and  practice,  prefers  an  arithmetic  sheet.  Such  percentage  calculations,  as
may seem to be required, can, after all, be made on another sheet or in the
head and the results then entered on the arithmetic chart if a record is desired.
Several ﬁrms specializing in the manufacture of graph paper and other
engineers’ and architects’ supplies now offer sheets speciﬁcally designed for
stock charting, on which heavier lines to deﬁne the business week mark each
sixth day on the time scale, and the price scale is subdivided into eighths to
represent the standard fractions of the dollar in which stocks are traded on

only of interest to the manual chartist, as modern software, as detailed in Appendix
D on Resources, enables the computer chartist to easily switch between price scales
and methods of charting. References to such paper are also found there.

On  weekly  charts,  each  vertical  line  represents  a  week’s  trading.  The
price range for the week is plotted thereon and usually the total volume, but
the closing price may or may not be omitted. The range extends, of course,
from the highest price at which the stock sold on any day during the week
to the lowest price at which it sold on any day; these two extremes might,
and sometimes do, occur on the same day, but the weekly chart makes no
distinction as to day. Monthly charts are prepared in the same way but do
not, as a rule, record volume. These two — often referred to as long-term or
major  charts  —  are  used  chieﬂy  for  determining  important  Support  and

Resistance  Levels  and  marking  long-term  trends.  Weekly  charts  —  if  the
reader  prefers  to  keep  his  own  —  can  be  posted  easily  from  the  Sunday

Barron’s Business and Financial Weekly
) that publish a summary of the previous
week’s transactions.

The  New  York  Times

In concluding this chapter on the construction of the charts that we shall
study  in  succeeding  chapters,  it  can  well  be  said  that  there  is  no  special
virtue, certainly no magic, in the chart itself. It is simply a pictorial record
of the trading history of the stock or stocks in which we may be interested.
To the man possessed of a photographic memory, no chart work is necessary;
his mind records all the necessary data — he carries his charts in his head.
Many  of  the  expert  “tape-readers”  who  have  no  use  for  charts  are  gifted
with  that  rare  memory  talent  which  renders  reference  to  graphic  records
unnecessary. But most of us are not so blessed; to use the chart is necessary
and useful because it lends itself conveniently to the type of analysis which
indicates future probabilities.

There is a saying on Wall Street to the effect that “there is nothing wrong
with  charts  —  the  trouble  is  with  the  chartists,”  which  is  simply  another
way of expressing the truth that it is not the chart itself but its interpretation
that is important. Chart analysis is certainly neither easy nor foolproof. Yet,
it is not at all uncommon for some casual investor who has no idea whatever
of market technics to pick up a chart by chance and see in it something which
he  had  not  hitherto  suspected,  something  perhaps  which  saves  him  from
making an unfavorable commitment.

If you have never used stock charts, never paid much attention to them,
you  may  be  surprised  at  some  of  the  signiﬁcant  things  you  will  quickly
detect as soon as you begin to study them seriously.

EN9: Surprise and astonishment are the words to describe the reactions of even
professionals when they are fully exposed to a coherent presentation of the methods
of  Edwards  and  Magee.  I  have  often  commented  that  no  understanding  of  other
(non-chart)  methods  of  technical  analysis  is  possible  without  a  ﬁrm  grasp  of  the
concepts and principles of this book.

Some other comments are worth noting relevant to Edwards’ discussion above.
For manual charting semi-log remains the superior scale. Given the ease of changing
scale and time frames on Internet sites (e.g., prophet.net and stockcharts.com) and
in  the  stand  alone  software  one  may  switch  from  a  close  up  of  a  month  to  a  long
range perspective of years. In this process it is important to maintain perspective.
Multiyear  log  charts  of  large  ranges  lose  graphic  importance  at  the  top  as  chart
intervals shrink. This distortion must be countered by breaking the time frame into
smaller increments. So instead of 5 years of a chart which spans a range of 10 to
200 we look at ﬁve charts of a year each as well as the 5-year chart.

The Dow Theory

The Dow Theory is the granddaddy of all technical market studies. Although
it is frequently criticized for being “too late,” and occasionally derided (par-
ticularly in the early stages of a Bear Market) by those who rebel at accepting
its  verdicts,  it  is  known  by  name  to  nearly  everyone  who  has  had  any
association with the stock market, and respected by most. Many who heed
it in greater or lesser degree in determining their investment policies never
realize that it is purely and simply “technical.” It is built upon and concerned
with nothing but the action of the stock market itself (as expressed in certain
“averages”), deriving nothing from the business statistics on which the fun-
damentalists depend.

There  is  much  in  the  writings  of  its  original  promulgator,  Charles  H.
Dow,  to  suggest  that  he  did  not  think  of  his  “theory”  as  a  device  for  fore-
casting  the  stock  market,  or  even  as  a  guide  for  investors,  but  rather  as  a
barometer of general business trends. Dow founded the Dow–Jones Financial
News Service and is credited with the invention of stock market averages.

averages

Before we proceed to an explanation of the theory itself, it will be nec-
essary to examine the stock 
 which it employs. Long before the time
of Dow, the fact was familiar to bankers and businessmen that the securities
of most established companies tended to go up or down in price together.
Exceptions — stocks that moved against the general ﬁnancial tide — were
rare, nor did they as a rule persevere in that contrary course for more than
a few days or weeks at a time. It is true that when a boom was on, the prices
of some issues rose faster and farther than others, and when the trend was
toward depression, some stocks declined rapidly while others would put up
considerable  resistance  to  the  forces  that  were  dragging  the  market  down,
but the fact remained that most securities tended to swing together. (They
still do, needless to say, and always will.)

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

This  fact,  as  we  have  said,  has  long  been  commonly  known  and
accepted — so  completely  taken  for  granted  that  its  importance  is  usually
overlooked. For it is important — tremendously important from many angles
in addition to those which come within the province of this volume. One of
the best of all reasons for a student of market technics to start with the Dow
Theory is because that theory stresses the 

general market trend
.

average price

Charles Dow is believed to have been the ﬁrst to make a thorough effort
to express the general trend (or, more correctly, level) of the securities market
 of a selected few representative stocks. As ﬁnally
in terms of the 
set up in January of 1897, in the form which has continued to date, and used
by Dow in his studies of market trends, there were two Dow–Jones Averages.
One  was  composed  of  the  stocks  of  20  railroad  companies  only,  for  the
railroads  were  the  dominant  corporate  enterprises  of  his  day.  The  other,
called  the  Industrial Average,  represented  all  other  types  of  business,  and
was made up, at ﬁrst, of only 12 issues. This number was increased to 20 in
1916 and to 30 on October 1, 1928.

The Dow Averages

The stocks included in these two Averages have been changed from time to
time  in  order  to  keep  the  lists  up  to  date  and  as  nearly  representative  as
possible  of  their  respective  groups.  Only  General  Electric,  of  the  present
30 industrial  stocks,  was  included  in  the  original  Industrial  Average,  and
that was dropped at one time (in 1898) and subsequently reinserted. In 1929,
all  stocks  of  public  utility  companies  were  dropped  from  the  Industrial
Average and a new Utility Average of 20 issues was set up; in 1938 its number
was reduced to 15. The 20 rail, 30 industrial, and 15 utility stocks are now
averaged together to make what is known as the Dow–Jones Stock Compos-
ite.  The  history  of  these Averages,  the  various  adjustments  that  have  been
made  in  them  and  their  method  of  computation,  is  an  interesting  story  in

 For
our present purpose, it remains only to add that the Dow Theory pays no
attention to the Utility or Composite Averages; its interpretations are based

The Wall Street Journal

In recent years, the values of the Dow–Jones Averages have been com-
puted  for  the  end  of  each  hour  of  trading  as  well  as  the  end  of  the  day.
EN: Now computed in real time and available over the Internet.
These hourly ﬁgures
are published in 
 as well as on all market tickers. In fact
presently the Averages are computed in real time, a necessity for options and futures
trading which takes place based on them.
 The Wall Street Journal also prints in
each issue a summary of the important highs and lows of each average by
date  for  the  preceding  two  or  three  years.  Their  daily  closing  prices  are
reported in many other metropolitan daily newspapers.

Basic Tenets

To get back to the Dow Theory itself here are its basic tenets:

1.

2.

3.

Primary

The  Averages  Discount  Everything  (except  “Acts  of  God”)
  —  Be-
cause  they  reﬂect  the  combined  market  activities  of  thousands  of
investors, including those possessed of the greatest foresight and the
best  information  on  trends  and  events,  the  Averages  in  their
day-to-day ﬂuctuations discount everything known, everything fore-
seeable,  and  every  condition  which  can  affect  the  supply  of  or  the
demand for corporate securities. Even unpredictable natural calam-
ities,  when  they  happen,  are  quickly  appraised  and  their  possible
effects discounted.
The Three Trends
 — The “market,” meaning the price of stocks in
Major
general, swings in trends, of which the most important are its 
or 
 Trends. These are the extensive up or down movements
which usually last for a year or more and result in general appreci-
ation or depreciation in value of more than 20%. Movements in the
Second-
direction of the Primary Trend are interrupted at intervals by 
ary
 Swings in the opposite direction — reactions or “corrections” that
occur  when  the  Primary  Move  has  temporarily  “gotten  ahead  of
itself.”  (Both  Secondaries  and  the  intervening  segments  of  the  Pri-
mary  Trend  are  frequently  lumped  together  as  Intermediate  Move-
ments  —  a  term  which  we  shall  ﬁnd  useful  in  subsequent  discus-
sions.) Finally, the Secondary Trends are composed of 
 Trends
or day-to-day ﬂuctuations which are unimportant to Dow Theory.
The  Primary  Trends
  —  These,  as  aforesaid,  are  the  broad,  overall,
up and down movements which usually (but not invariably) last for
more  than  a  year  and  may  run  for  several  years.  So  long  as  each
successive rally (price advance) reaches a higher level than the one
before  it,  and  each  Secondary  Reaction  stops  (i.e.,  the  price  trend
reverses from down to up) at a higher level than the previous reac-
. Conversely,

loosely with reference, respectively, to any sort of up or down move-
ments,  but  we  shall  use  them  in  this  book  only  in  connection  with
the Major or Primary Movements of the market in the Dow sense.)
Ordinarily — theoretically, at least — the Primary is the only one of
the three trends with which the true long-term investor is concerned.
His aim is to buy stocks as early as possible in a Bull Market — just
as soon as he can be sure that one has started — and then hold them
until (and only until) it becomes evident that it has ended and a Bear

Market  has  started.  He  knows  that  he  can  safely  disregard  all  the
intervening Secondary Reactions and Minor Fluctuations. The trader,
however, may well concern himself also with the Secondary Swings,
and it will appear later on in this book that he can do so with proﬁt.
The  Secondary  Trends
  —  These  are  the  important  reactions  that
interrupt  the  progress  of  prices  in  the  Primary  Direction.  They  are
the Intermediate Declines or “corrections” which occur during Bull
Markets, the Intermediate Rallies or “recoveries” which occur in Bear
Markets. Normally, they last for 3 weeks to many months, and rarely
longer.  Normally,  they  retrace  from  one  third  to  two  thirds  of  the
gain (or loss, as the case may be) in prices registered in the preceding
swing  in  the  Primary  Direction.  Thus,  in  a  Bull  Market,  prices  in
terms of the Industrial Average might rise steadily, or with only brief
and minor interruptions, for a total gain of 30 (or 300) points before
a  Secondary  Correction  occurred.  That  correction  might  then  be
expected to produce a decline of not less than 10 points and not more
than  20  points  before  a  new  Intermediate  Advance  in  the  Primary
Bull Trend developed.

Note,  however,  that  the  one  third/two  thirds  rule  is  not  an
unbreakable law; it is simply a statement of probabilities. Most Sec-
ondaries  are  conﬁned  within  these  limits;  many  of  them  stop  very
close  to  the  halfway  mark,  retracing  50%  of  the  preceding  Primary
Swing. They seldom run less than one third, but some of them cancel
nearly all of it.

Thus  we  have  two  criteria  by  which  to  recognize  a  Secondary
Trend.  Any  price  movement  contrary  in  direction  to  the  Primary
Trend that lasts for at least 3 weeks and retraces at least one third of
the  preceding  net  move  in  the  Primary  Direction  (from  the  end  of
the preceding Secondary to the beginning of this one, disregarding
Minor  Fluctuations)  is  labeled  as  of  Intermediate  Rank,  i.e.,  a  true
Secondary.  Despite  these  criteria,  however,  the  Secondary  Trend  is
often  confusing;  its  recognition,  its  correct  appraisal  at  the  time  it
develops  and  while  it  is  in  process,  poses  the  Dow  theorist’s  most
difﬁcult problem. We shall have more to say about this later.
The Minor Trends
 — These are the brief (rarely as long as 3 weeks —
usually  less  than  6  days)  ﬂuctuations  which  are,  so  far  as  the  Dow
in toto
Theory is concerned, meaningless in themselves, but which, 
,
make up the Intermediate Trends. Usually, but not always, an Inter-
mediate  Swing,  whether  a  Secondary  or  the  segment  of  a  Primary
between  successive  Secondaries,  is  made  up  of  a  series  of  three  or
more  distinguishable  Minor  Waves.  Inferences  drawn  from  these
day-  to-day  ﬂuctuations  are  quite  apt  to  be  misleading.  The  Minor
Trend is the only one of the three trends which can be “manipulated”
(although it is, in fact, doubtful if under present conditions even that
can be purposely manipulated to any important extent). Primary and

Secondary Trends cannot be manipulated; it would strain the resourc-
es of the U.S. Treasury to do so.

Right here, before we go on to state a sixth Dow tenet, we may well take
time  out  for  a  few  minutes  to  clarify  the  concept  of  the  three  trends  by
drawing  an  analogy  between  the  movements  of  the  stock  market  and  the
movements of the sea. The Major (Primary) Trends in stock prices are like
the tides. We can compare a Bull Market to an incoming or ﬂood tide which
carries  the  water  farther  and  farther  up  the  beach  until  ﬁnally  it  reaches
high-water mark and begins to turn. Then follows the receding or ebb tide,
comparable to a Bear Market. But all the time, during both ebb and ﬂow of
the tide, the waves are rolling in, breaking on the beach, and then receding.
While the tide is rising, each succeeding wave pushes a little farther up onto
the shore and, as it recedes, does not carry the water quite so far back as did
its predecessor. During the tidal ebb, each advancing wave falls a little short
of the mark set by the one before it, and each receding wave uncovers a little
more  of  the  beach.  These  waves  are  the  Intermediate  Trends,  Primary  or
Secondary,  depending  on  whether  their  movement  is  with  or  against  the
direction of the tide. Meanwhile, the surface of the water is constantly agi-
tated by wavelets, ripples, and “cat’s-paws” moving with or against or across
the trend of the waves — these are analogous to the market’s Minor Trends,
its unimportant day-to-day ﬂuctuations. The tide, the wave, and the ripple
represent, respectively, the Primary or Major, the Secondary or Intermediate,
and the Minor Trends of the market.

Tide, Wave, and Ripple

A  shore  dweller  who  had  no  tide  table  might  set  about  determining  the
direction  of  the  tide  by  driving  a  stake  in  the  beach  at  the  highest  point
reached by an incoming wave. Then if the next wave pushed the water up
beyond his stake he would know the tide was rising. If he shifted his stake
with the peak mark of each wave, a time would come when one wave would
stop  and  start  to  recede  short  of  his  previous  mark;  then  he  would  know
that  the  tide  had  turned,  had  started  to  ebb.  That,  in  effect  (and  much
simpliﬁed), is what the Dow theorist does in deﬁning the trend of the stock
market.

The  comparison  with  tide,  wave,  and  ripple  has  been  used  since  the
earliest days of the Dow Theory. It is even possible that the movements of
the  sea  may  have  suggested  the  elements  of  the  theory  to  Dow.  But  the
analogy cannot be pushed too far. The tides and waves of the stock market
are  nothing  like  as  regular  as  those  of  the  ocean.  Tables  can  be  prepared
years in advance to predict accurately the time of every ebb and ﬂow of the
waters,  but  no  timetables  are  provided  by  the  Dow  Theory  for  the  stock
market. We may return to some points of this comparison later, but we must
proceed now to take up the remaining tenets and rules of the Theory.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Major Trend Phases

6.

7.

The  Bull  Market
  —  Primary  Uptrends  are  usually  (but  not  invari-
accumulation
ably) divisible into three phases. The ﬁrst is the phase of 
during  which  farsighted  investors,  sensing  that  business,  although
now depressed, is due to turn up, are willing to pick up all the shares
offered by discouraged and distressed sellers, and to raise their bids
gradually as such selling diminishes in volume. Financial reports are
still  bad  —  in  fact,  often  at  their  worst  —  during  this  phase.  The
“public” is completely disgusted with the stock market — out of it
entirely. Activity is only moderate but beginning to increase on the
rallies (Minor Advances).

The  second  phase  is  one  of  fairly  steady  advance  and  increasing
activity as the improved tone of business and a rising trend in corporate
earnings begin to attract attention. It is during this phase that the “tech-
nical” trader normally is able to reap his best harvest of proﬁts.

Finally, comes the third phase when the market boils with activity
as  the  “public”  ﬂocks  to  the  boardrooms. All  the  ﬁnancial  news  is
good, price advances are spectacular and frequently “make the front
page” of the daily papers, and new issues are brought out in increas-
ing numbers. It is during this phase that one of your friends will call
up and blithely remark, “Say, I see the market is going up. What’s a
good buy?” — all oblivious to the fact that it has been going up for
perhaps  two  years,  has  already  gone  up  a  long  ways,  and  is  now
reaching the stage where it might be more appropriate to ask, “What’s
a good thing to sell?” In the last stage of this phase, with speculation
rampant,  volume  continues  to  rise,  but  “air  pockets”  appear  with
increasing  frequency;  the  “cats  and  dogs”  (low-priced  stocks  of  no
investment  value)  are  whirled  up,  but  more  and  more  of  the
top-grade issues refuse to follow.
The Bear Market
 — Primary Downtrends are also usually (but again,
distribution
not invariably) characterized by three phases. The ﬁrst is the 
period  (which  really  starts  in  the  later  stages  of  the  preceding  Bull
Market).  During  this  phase,  farsighted  investors  sense  the  fact  that
business earnings have reached an abnormal height and unload their
holdings  at  an  increasing  pace.  Trading  volume  is  still  high,  though
tending to diminish on rallies, and the “public” is still active but begin-
ning to show signs of frustration as hoped-for proﬁts fade away.

The second phase is the Panic Phase. Buyers begin to thin out and
sellers become more urgent; the downward trend of prices suddenly
accelerates  into  an  almost  vertical  drop,  while  volume  mounts  to
climactic proportions. After the Panic Phase (which usually runs too
far relative to then-existing business conditions), there may be a fairly
long  Secondary  Recovery  or  a  sideways  movement,  and  then  the
third phase begins.

This is characterized by discouraged selling on the part of those
investors who held on through the Panic or, perhaps, bought during
it because stocks looked cheap in comparison with prices which had
ruled a few months earlier. The business news now begins to dete-
riorate. As the third phase proceeds, the downward movement is less
rapid, but is maintained by more and more distress selling from those
who  have  to  raise  cash  for  other  needs.  The  “cats  and  dogs”  may
lose practically all their previous Bull Advance in the ﬁrst two phases.
Better-grade  stocks  decline  more  gradually,  because  their  owners
cling  to  them  to  the  last.  And,  the  ﬁnal  stage  of  a  Bear  Market,  in
consequence,  is  frequently  concentrated  in  such  issues.  The  Bear
Market ends when everything in the way of possible bad news, the
worst  to  be  expected,  has  been  discounted,  and  it  is  usually  over
before all the bad news is “out.”

The  three  Bear  Market  phases  described  in  the  preceding  para-
graph are not the same as those named by others who have discussed
this  subject,  but  the  writers  of  this  study  feel  that  they  represent  a
more accurate and realistic division of the Primary down moves of
the  past  30  years.  The  reader  should  be  warned,  however,  that  no
two  Bear  Markets  are  exactly  alike,  and  neither  are  any  two  Bull
Markets. Some may lack one or another of the three typical phases.
A few Major Advances have passed from the ﬁrst to the third stage
with  only  a  very  brief  and  rapid  intervening  markup. A  few  short
Bear  Markets  have  developed  no  marked  Panic  Phase  and  others
have  ended  with  it,  as  in April  1939.  No  time  limits  can  be  set  for
any phase; the third stage of a Bull Market, for example, the phase
of  excited  speculation  and  great  public  activity,  may  last  for  more
than a year or run out in a month or two. The Panic Phase of a Bear
Market is usually exhausted in a very few weeks if not in days, but
the  1929  through  1932  decline  was  interspersed  with  at  least  ﬁve
Panic Waves of major proportions. Nevertheless, the typical charac-
teristics  of  Primary  Trends  are  well  worth  keeping  in  mind.  If  you
know the symptoms which normally accompany the last stage of a
Bull  Market,  for  example,  you  are  less  likely  to  be  deluded  by  its
exciting atmosphere.

Principle of Conﬁrmation

8.

The  Two  Averages  Must  Conﬁrm
  —  This  is  the  most-often  ques-
tioned and the most difﬁcult to rationalize of all the Dow principles.
Yet it has stood the test of time; the fact that it has “worked” is not
disputed  by  any  who  have  carefully  examined  the  records.  Those
who have disregarded it in practice have, more often than not, had
occasion to regret their apostasy. What it means is that no valid signal
of a change in trend can be produced by the action of one Average

principle  of 
,  it  might  have
been said that the Industrials had thus far not conﬁrmed the Rails in
continuing the downtrend — but this had to do only with the con-
tinuation or reafﬁrmation of an existing trend. It is not necessary that
the  two  Averages  conﬁrm  on  the  same  day.  Frequently,  both  will
move  into  new  high  (or  low)  ground  together,  but  there  are  plenty
of  cases  in  which  one  or  the  other  lags  behind  for  days,  weeks,  or
even  a  month  or  two.  One  must  be  patient  in  these  doubtful  cases
and wait until the market declares itself in deﬁnite fashion.
“Volume  Goes  with  the  Trend”
  —  Those  words,  which  you  may
often hear spoken with ritual solemnity but little understanding, are
the  colloquial  expression  for  the  general  truth  that  trading  activity
tends  to  expand  as  prices  move  in  the  direction  of  the  prevailing
Primary Trend. Thus, in a Bull Market, volume increases when prices
rise  and  dwindles  as  prices  decline;  in  Bear  Markets,  turnover  in-
creases  when  prices  drop  and  dries  up  as  they  recover.  To  a  lesser
degree, this holds for Secondary Trends also, especially in the early
stages  of  an  extended  Secondary  Recovery  within  a  Bear  Market,
when activity may show a tendency to pick up on the Minor Rallies
and  diminish  on  the  Minor  Set-backs.  But  to  this  rule,  again,  there
are  exceptions,  and  useful  conclusions  can  seldom  be  drawn  from
the volume manifestations of a few days, much less a single trading
session; it is only the overall and relative volume trend over a period
of  time  that  may  produce  helpful  indications.  Moreover,  in  Dow
  signals  as  to  the  market’s  trend  are  produced  in
Theory, 
the  ﬁnal  analysis  only  by  price  movement.  Volume  simply  affords
collateral evidence which may aid interpretation of otherwise doubt-
ful  situations.  (We  shall  have  much  more  to  say  in  later  chapters
about volume in speciﬁc relation to other technical phenomena.)
“Lines”  May  Substitute  for  Secondaries
  in  Dow  Theory
parlance is a sideways movement (as it appears on the charts) in one
or both of the Averages, which lasts for 2 or 3 weeks or, sometimes,
for as many months, in the course of which prices ﬂuctuate within
a  range  of  approximately  5%  or  less  (of  their  mean  ﬁgure).  The
formation  of  a  Line  signiﬁes  that  pressure  of  buying  and  selling  is
more  or  less  in  balance.  Eventually,  of  course,  either  the  offerings
within  that  price  range  are  exhausted  and  those  who  want  to  buy
stocks have to raise their bids to induce owners to sell, or else those
who are eager to sell at the “Line” price range ﬁnd that buyers have
vanished and that, in consequence, they must cut their prices in order
to dispose of their shares. Hence, an advance in prices through the
upper limits of an established Line is a Bullish Signal and, conversely,

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

a break down through its lower limits is a Bearish Signal. Generally
speaking, the longer the Line (in duration) and the narrower or more
compact  its  price  range,  the  greater  the  signiﬁcance  of  its  ultimate
breakout.

Lines  occur  often  enough  to  make  their  recognition  essential  to
followers of Dow’s principles. They may develop at important Tops
or  Bottoms,  signaling  periods  of  distribution  or  of  accumulation,
respectively, but they come more frequently as interludes of rest or
Consolidation  in  the  progress  of  established  Major  Trends.  Under
those circumstances, they take the place of normal Secondary Waves.
A Line may develop in one Average while the other is going through
a  typical  Secondary  Reaction.  It  is  worth  noting  that  a  price  move-
ment out of a Line, either up or down, is usually followed by a more
extensive additional move in the same direction than can be counted
on to follow the “signal” produced when a new wave pushes beyond
the limits set by a preceding Primary Wave. The direction in which
prices will break out of a Line cannot be determined in advance of
the actual movement. The 5% limit ordinarily assigned to a Line is
arbitrarily based on experience; there have been a few slightly wider
sideways movements which, by virtue of their compactness and well-
deﬁned boundaries, could be construed as true Lines. (Further on in
this book, we shall see that the Dow Line is, in many respects, similar
to  the  more  strictly  deﬁned  patterns  known  as  Rectangles  which
appear on the charts of individual stocks.)
Only Closing Prices Used
 — Dow Theory pays no attention to any
extreme  highs  or  lows  which  may  be  registered  during  a  day  and
before  the  market  closes,  but  takes  into  account  only  the  closing
ﬁgures, i.e., the average of the day’s ﬁnal sale prices for the compo-
nent issues. We have discussed the psychological importance of the
end-of-day  prices  under  the  subject  of  chart  construction  and  need
not deal with it further here, except to say that this is another Dow
rule  which  has  stood  the  test  of  time.  It  works  thus:  suppose  an
Intermediate Advance  in  a  Primary  Uptrend  reaches  its  peak  on  a
certain day at 11 a.m., at which hour the Industrial Average ﬁgures
at, say, 152.45, and then falls back to close at 150.70. All that the next
advance will have to do in order to indicate that the Primary Trend
is still 
 is register a daily close above 150.70. The previous intraday
high of 152.45 does not count. Conversely, using the same ﬁgures for
our  ﬁrst  advance,  if  the  next  upswing  carries  prices  to  an  intraday
high at, say, 152.60, but fails to register a closing price above 150.70,
the continuation of the Primary Bull Trend is still in doubt.

up

In recent years, differences of opinion have arisen among market
students as to the extent to which an Average should push beyond
a previous limit (Top or Bottom ﬁgure) in order to signal (or conﬁrm
or reafﬁrm, as the case may be) a market trend. Dow and Hamilton
evidently regarded any penetration, even as little as 0.01, in closing

price as a valid signal, but some modern commentators have required
penetration by a full point (1.00). We think that the original view has
the  best  of  the  argument,  that  the  record  shows  little  or  nothing  in
practical  results  to  favor  any  of  the  proposed  modiﬁcations.  One
incident  in  June  of  1946,  to  which  we  shall  refer  in  the  following
chapter, shows a decided advantage for the orthodox “any-penetra-
tion-whatever” rule.
A Trend Should Be Assumed to Continue in Effect Until Such Time
as Its Reversal Has Been Deﬁnitely Signaled
 — This Dow Theory
tenet  is  one  which,  perhaps  more  than  any  other,  has  evoked  criti-
cism. Yet, when correctly understood, it, like all the others we have
enumerated, stands up under practical test. What it states is really a
probability
. It is a warning against changing one’s market position too
soon, against “jumping the gun.” It does not imply that one should
delay action by one unnecessary minute once a signal of change in
trend has appeared. But it expresses the experience that the odds are
in favor of the man who waits until he is sure, and against the other
fellow who buys (or sells) prematurely. These odds cannot be stated
in mathematical language such as 2–1 or 3–1; as a matter of fact, they
are constantly changing. Bull Markets do not climb forever and Bear
Markets always reach a Bottom sooner or later. When a new Primary
Trend  is  ﬁrst  deﬁnitely  signaled  by  the  action  of  the  two Averages,
the odds that it will be continued, despite any near-term reactions or
interruptions, are at their greatest. But as this Primary Trend carries
on, the odds in favor of its further extension grow smaller. Thus, each
successive reafﬁrmation of a Bull Market (new Intermediate high in
one  average  conﬁrmed  by  a  new  Intermediate  high  in  the  other)
carries  relatively  less  weight.  The  incentive  to  buy,  the  prospect  of
selling new purchases at a proﬁt, is smaller after a Bull Market has
been in existence for several months than it was when the Primary
Uptrend was ﬁrst recognized, but this twelfth Dow tenet says, “Hold
your position pending contrary orders.”

A corollary to this tenet, which is not so contradictory as it may
 after that trend
at ﬁrst seem, is: a Reversal in trend can occur 
has been conﬁrmed. This can be taken simply as a warning that the
Dow Theory investor must watch the market constantly if he has any
commitment in it.

EN: Modern Market Importance of Dow Theory and 
Necessity for Moving to a New Composite Market Theory 

Dow Theory has much to recommend it. Concepts embodied within Dow Theory retain
their validity to the present day, and retain their importance as the foundation thinking
for technical analysis. Concepts of waves, major secondary and minor movements are
absolutely descriptive of the reality of the market. Other constructs within Dow Theory

are similarly important — that all information is discounted; that major market move-
ments  are  like  the  tide  and,  as  it  were,  raise  all  boats;  that  trends  tend  to  continue.
These are not just theoretical musings, but observations of reality.

In  addition  to  its  technical  validity  the  Dow  has  now  taken  on  a  mythic
dimension.  It  now  has  a  symbolic  function  which  interacts  with  its  originally
intended purpose. Dow and Hamilton saw their measurement of the market as an
economic  barometer  for  the  entire  economy.  Its  use  as  a  tool  for  investing  in  the
market came later.

In the opinion of this editor, the Dow Theory is no longer adequate to its original
purpose — or even to its secondary purpose. It is a simple theory propounded in a
simple  time.  Expounders  of  Dow  Theory  have  implicitly  recognized  the  necessity
for evolutionary changes to the doctrine with the addition of the Rails (now Trans-
portations)  and  the  Utilities  ad  inﬁnitum.  Thirty  stocks  may  have  been  sufﬁcient
originally to reﬂect the American economy. No one would deny that simple paradigm
must be changed to reﬂect an economic structure geometrically more diverse than
that  of  Dow  and  Hamilton.  Entering  the  21st  century,  the  American  and  Global
economy require more sophisticated econometrics than the Dow alone.

For that reason I now consider that in order to fulﬁll the functions of the old
Dow we now must consider a variety of averages and indexes to measure the state
of the market — not to mention the economy, which is another question, although
not altogether another question, but at least another question. Magee foreshadowed
some instruments of great value to this end in his writings, speciﬁcally on the Magee
Evaluative  Index  (Chapter 38),  which  may  be  used  for  the  entire  market,  and  not
just  for  one  summary  index  or  average.  The  value  and  power  of  this  tool  are  still
little used and understood.

In 21st century markets, there are not just broad tides and markets ﬂowing in
one direction as they might on Magee’s Cape Cod. Instead the currents, rip tides,
and cross currents are like the economy of the country, moved West. They are now
symbolized  by  the  Paciﬁc  Ocean  roaring  in  and  out  of  San  Francisco  Bay.  While
the Dow is in a secondary Downtrend, the broader S&P 500 is going to new highs,
and while they are both whipping sideways, the NASDAQ is rocketing into space.
For this reason, I now believe that only a composite of the three indexes can express
the true state of the markets as a whole. And, in addition, to dissect the entrails of
the market, the Magee Evaluative Index should be run across the three indexes.

The Dow Theory required that the Rails and Industrials move in harmony in order
to signal Bull or Bear Markets. In this century, there is a similar need for harmonic
convergence among the averages to indicate to us the state of the markets as a whole.
When  all  three  indexes  agree  in  the  direction  of  their  trends,  up  or  down  or
sideways, Bulls may assumed to be safe in general, and vice versa for Bears. Failure
of  the  three  to  be  in  harmony  is  a  clear  sign  of  mixed  markets  and  advises  one  to
arrange  his  bets  and  portfolio  to  correspond  with  economic  uncertainty.  Capital
should ﬂow naturally to the area which is most productive. What reason is there to
ride the Dow down when the NASDAQ is raging up? If the investor follows the
philosophy of this book, he will never sit passively through an extended Downtrend.
At the very least, he will be hedged, if not outright short. (As Edwards and Magee
preferred and as this editor prefers.)

The Dow Theory in Practice

EN9: The casual and careless reader will shake his head at this chapter and ask why
on earth the Editor has not excised it from the book. The Editor has not deleted the
chapter because, like old-fashioned cod liver oil, it is good medicine. It will appeal
mainly to the serious student of not just Dow Theory, but of 
long-term investing.
If  the  reader  has  absolutely  no  interest  in  Dow  Theory  or  long-term  investing  he
may skip over this chapter and return to it in his old age, when he is wiser.

At  this  point,  the  reader,  if  he  has  little  previous  knowledge  of  the  stock
market,  may  be  suffering  a  mild  attack  of  mental  indigestion.  The  Dow
Theory is a pretty big dose to swallow at one sitting. We departed deliber-
ately  in  the  foregoing  chapter  from  the  order  in  which  its  principles  are
usually stated in an effort to make it a little easier to follow and understand.
Actually, not all of the 12 tenets we named are of equal import. The essential
rules  are  contained  in  2,  3,  4,  5,  8,  10,  and  11.  Number  1  is,  of  course,  the
basic  assumption,  the  philosophical  justiﬁcation  for  these  rules.  The  other
points (6, 7, 9, and 12) furnish “background material,” as the news reporters
might put it, which aid in interpretation. Theoretically, one should, by strict
adherence to the essential rules alone, accomplish just as much as he could
with the added collateral evidence.

But the utilization of Dow Theory is, after all, a matter of interpretation.
You may memorize its principles verbatim and yet be confounded when you
attempt to apply them to an actual market situation. We can better organize
our  knowledge  of  the  theory  and  acquire  some  understanding  of  its  inter-
pretation by following through a few years of market action and seeing how
it looked at the time through the eyes of a Dow theorist. For this purpose,
we may well take the period from late 1941 to the beginning of 1947, since
this covers the end of one Bear Market, an entire long Bull Market, and part
of another Bear Market, and includes examples of most of the market phe-
nomena with which the Dow Theory has to deal.

Five Years of Dow Interpretation
Figure 2 is a condensed chart of the course of the two Dow Jones Averages
from  January  1,  1941,  to  December  31,  1946,  on  which  most  of  the  Minor
Trends  have  been  disregarded  but  all  the  recognized  Intermediate  Swings
(Primary and Secondary) have been indicated. Certain portions of this his-
tory will be supplemented by complete daily charts in connection with our
detailed discussion which follows.

(EN: OR Wave)

The year 1941 opened with the stock market in a Minor Rally. A Primary
Bear Market had been signaled when prices collapsed in the spring of 1940,
and that Bear Market was still in effect. After the May Panic had ended, a
Secondary  Recovery  swing,  which  lasted  for  more  than  5  months,  had
regained  more  than  half  of  the  ground  previously  lost  by  the  Averages,
carrying the Industrials from their closing price of 111.84 on June 10 to 138.12
on November 9 and the Rails from 22.14 on May 21 to 30.29 on November 14.
(During  this  long  Bear  Market  Secondary,  incidentally,  volume  tended  to
increase on rallies, which encouraged many who did not hold strictly to ﬁrst
principles  to  believe  that  this  rise  was  the  beginning  of  a  new  Bull  Trend,
illustrating  the  point  we  cited  under  “Volume”  in  Chapter 3.)  From  the
November highs, however, the trend turned down again. Then a Minor Rally
developed,  as  we  have  said,  at  the  end  of  the  year,  reaching  its  peak  on
January  10  at  133.59  in  the  Industrials  and  29.73  in  the  Rails.  From  there,
prices fell again to 117.66 and 26.54, respectively, on February 14.

The First Severe Test

The next few months will be particularly interesting for us to trace because
they put the Dow Theory to a real test. Figure 3 shows the daily ranges and
closing  prices  of  the  two  Averages  and  total  daily  market  volume  for  the
7 months from February 1 to August 31, 1941. Before we examine it in detail,
however, let us ﬁrst review the situation on February 14. The Bear Market
lows to date had been registered in May–June, 1940. Thereafter, an extended
Intermediate  Recovery  had  advanced  the  Industrial  Average  26.28  points
and  the  Rail  Average  8.15  points.  This  had  been  followed  by  a  3-month
decline of 20.46 and 3.75 points, respectively, and this decline, incidentally,
had consisted of three well-deﬁned Minor Waves. In duration, and in extent
of price change with respect to the previous swing — 46% in the Rails and
nearly 78% in the Industrials — this downswing qualiﬁed as an Intermediate
Trend,  and  now  prices  were  turning  up  again.  Dow  theorists  were  on  the
alert.  If  both Averages  could  continue  their  rise  to  levels  above  their  high
closes of the previous November (138.12 and 30.29), that action would con-
stitute  a  signal  of  a  new  Primary  Bull  Market,  and  reinvestment  of  funds
withdrawn from stocks in May 1940 would be at once in order. Also, it would
then  be  necessary  to  go  back  and  label  the  May–June  lows  of  1940  as  the
end of a Bear Market, the advance to November as the ﬁrst Primary Swing
in  the  new  Bull  Market,  and  the  decline  to  February  as  its  ﬁrst  Secondary

Reaction. But note that Rule 12 of our preceding chapter applied here; the
presumption was that it was still a Bear Market until a deﬁnite signal to the
contrary appeared.

Let  us  now  turn  again  to  Figure 3  and  see  what  actually  did  happen.
The Industrials rallied for 6 weeks, reaching 124.65 on April 3. The Rails got
up to 29.75 on the same date, registering double the percentage gain of the
Industrials, but both Averages were still below their November highs. Then
the Industrials slipped off within 2 weeks, and had broken down below their
February  low  and  drifted  down  to  close  at  115.30  on  May  1.  This Average
was, therefore, still in an Intermediate Downtrend. But the Rails, meanwhile,
were staging a different sort of performance. They dropped back from their
April 3 high for 2 weeks, but held at 27.72, rallied smartly and then sold off
again to 27.43 on May 31. The picture became at once even more interesting.
Here was a Divergence between the two Averages, a failure to conﬁrm; the
Rails, after two opportunities, were refusing to conﬁrm the Industrials in the
latter’s downtrend.

Failure to Conﬁrm

When  prices  began  to  work  upward  in  June,  many  commentators  seized
upon  this  “failure  to  conﬁrm”  as  a  Bullish  omen  and  the  wishful  thinkers
again talked Bull Market. There is an unfortunate tendency in “the Street”
to overstress any such divergence, particularly when it can be twisted into
a favorable sign. The fact is that, in Dow Theory, the refusal of one Average
to conﬁrm the other can never produce a positive signal of any sort. It has
only negative connotations. Divergences sometimes occur at Reversals in the
Major Trend — there have been several instances in market history, in which,
perhaps, the most remarkable occurred way back in 1901 and 1902, and we
shall  soon  inspect  another  —  but  they  also  occur  with  equal  frequency  at
times when no Major Reversal is developing, and the instance we are dis-
cussing here was one of the latter.

So the situation at the end of May in 1941 was precisely the same to the
Dow theorist, insofar as the Major Trend was concerned, as it had been on
February 14. The June–July rally topped out in the Rails at 30.88 on August
1,  and  in  the  Industrials  at  130.06  on  July  28  (compare  these  ﬁgures  with
their 1940 November highs) and prices then declined at an accelerating pace
which  culminated,  temporarily,  in  the  “Pearl  Harbor”  Panic.  This  took  the
Industrial Average below its previous Bear Market low (111.84 on June 10,
1940), although the Rails, again, did not follow. They had, however, by this
time, broken below their previous (February 14) Intermediate Bottom by a
liberal margin.

The  next  period  of  importance  began  in  April  1942.  We  can  skip  any
detailed  chart  of  the  months  between  December  and  April  because  they
posed no Dow Theory problems. After a Minor Rally in the Rails in January,
prices simply drifted lower and lower, but it was increasingly evident that
trading  volume  did  not  expand  on  the  dips  (Minor  Declines).  Liquidation

was drying up; the boardrooms were void of customers; the atmosphere was
typical of the last stages of a Bear Market.

Figure 4  shows  the  daily  action  of  the  Averages  from  March  2  to
October 31, 1942. New lows (since 1940) were registered in both in late April,
at 23.72 on April 24 in the Rails and at 92.92 on April 28 in the Industrials.
Shortly thereafter, a notable Divergence developed, when, after rallying for
only  7 days,  the  Railroad  Index  began  to  slip  off  while  the  other  Average
kept right on going up. Trading activity remained at a low ebb (there was
no sustained volume increase, in fact, until late September). On June 1, the
Rails dropped to another new low and on the 2nd closed at 23.31. On June
22, it looked as though the Industrials were going to be pulled down again,
but  only  a  few  days  later,  the  best  rally  in  months  got  started,  taking  the
Industrials to new highs and more than recovering all of the April–May loss
in  the  Rails.  Activity  also  speeded  up  brieﬂy,  with  one  day  registering  a
greater  turnover  than  the  market  had  enjoyed  in  any  session  since  early

Signs of Major Turn

Again  the  Dow  theorists  were  very  much  on  the  alert. An  advance  of  Inter-
mediate proportions was obviously under way. Until proved otherwise, it had
to be labeled a Secondary within the Bear Market which was still presumably

in  effect,  but  that  Major  Downtrend  had  by  now  run  for  nearly  3 years  —
nearly as long as any on record — and its last decline had shown no selling
pressure whatever, simply a dull drift. This presumed Secondary might turn
out to be, instead, a new Primary; hopes for such a denouement had been
blighted 12 months earlier under somewhat similar circumstances, but this
time prices were lower and there was a different “feel” to the market. The
general  news  offered  little  encouragement,  but  the  Dow  Theory  does  not
concern itself with any news other than that made by the market itself (which
discounts all other kinds of news). In any event, there was nothing to do but
wait and see — let the market, in its own time and way, state its own case.
In early July, the Industrials started to “mark time”; for 11 weeks, they
ﬂuctuated within a 5-point range, building a typical Dow Line from which
they emerged on the upside in late September. The Rails pushed up to a new
high for the move at the same time, and by November 2, both Averages had
surpassed their Rally Tops of the preceding January. At this stage, some Dow
theorists  were  willing  to  announce  that  a  Bull  Market  had  been  signaled.
Their arguments, aside from points of a nontechnical nature or having noth-
ing to do with Dow Theory, were:

1. The  conspicuously  low  level  of  volume  at  the  April–June  Bottom,

typical of the end of a Bear Swing. (True and cogent.)

2. The Rail Average had refused to follow the Industrials into new Major
low ground at that time. It had held above its closing level of May
1940.  (Also  true,  but  of  questionable  signiﬁcance.  More  about  this
later.)

3. The Industrials had constructed a Line and gone up out of it. (Again
true,  but  the  Line  was  somewhat  short  to  have,  beyond  a  doubt,
major import.)

4. The  Rail  Average  had  for  4  months  produced  successively  higher
Minor Tops and Bottoms. (And this also was true but did not permit
of positive differentiation from a Bear Market Secondary.)

The  more  conservative  Dow  theorists  were  not  yet  convinced.  They
maintained  that  this  uptrend  had  yet  to  undergo  the  test,  bound  to  occur
sooner or later, of an Intermediate Reaction. They admitted that the picture
was most encouraging, but called attention to the fact that, except for Point
1, it was no better than that of November 1940. Let’s follow along through
the next 5 months. Figure 5 shows the daily market action from November
1, 1942, to June 30, 1943.

The Bull Signal

After  reaching  29.28  at  their  close  on  November  2,  the  Rails  declined  in
almost  a  straight  line  for  6  weeks  to  26.03  on  December  14.  This  move
indubitably rated as an Intermediate in duration, and it had “given up” more
than  half  of  that Average’s  entire  advance  from  the  June  2  low  point.  The

from November 2, 1942, to June 30, 1943, and total daily market volume. This chart
follows  and  should  be  compared  with  Figure 4.  The  decline  in  the  Rail  Average
during  November  and  early  December  produced  the  ﬁrst  test  of  the  Major  Trend
since the preceding June. When this Index recovered and, on February 1, 1943, closed
above its November 2 high, a Primary Bull Market was thereby signaled according
to Dow Theory.

Industrial Index, however, held stoutly in another narrow Line throughout
November, December, and January. From December 14, the Rails turned up,
and  ﬁnally,  on  February  1,  1943,  closed  at  29.55,  out  above  their  previous
Intermediate  Top  of  29.28  recorded  the  previous  November.  By  then,  the
Industrials had also moved up into new high ground. This development at
last satisﬁed every strictest requirement of Dow Theory; a new Primary Bull
Market was in force. Trading volume had also been expanding on each Minor
Advance during the fall and winter months, but its evidence was not needed;
the price action alone was conclusive. The Rails had produced the necessary
sequence of higher Intermediate Tops and Bottoms. In the Industrials, Lines
had served the purposes of the theory as substitutes for Intermediate Reactions.
It was necessary now to relabel the up-move from April–June to Novem-
ber of 1942 as the ﬁrst Primary Swing in a Bull Market. The decline of the
Rails  from  November  2  to  December  14  was  now  recognized  as  the  ﬁrst
Secondary within that Major Trend.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

We  may  turn  back  for  a  moment  at  this  point  to  comment  on  the  per-
formance of the Rail Index in June 1942. Because it held then above its low
of  May  1940,  some  commentators  have  maintained  that  the  Bull  Market
should really have been dated from that former year as representing the last
“conﬁrmed” lows. This strikes us as rather impractical hair-splitting. Regard-
less of the 1.17 higher level in the Rail Average in June 1942, a genuine Bull
Move did not start until that time. We suspect that before many years have
passed,  Dow  theorists  will  have  occasion  greatly  to  regret  the  importance
which has since been assigned to the Rails’ “failure to conﬁrm” in the spring
of 1942. Remember, such a Divergence does not and cannot produce a pos-
itive  signal;  at  the  time  of  its  occurrence,  it  can  serve  merely  to  negate  or
cast in doubt the implications of the other Average; only subsequent action
in the opposite direction can establish the existence of a change in trend. If
the  Rails’  decline  in  May  1942  had  carried  them  below  22.14,  but  their
subsequent action had followed the course which it actually did, point for
point  but  at  a  lower  level,  a  Bull  Market  Signal  would  nevertheless  have
been given at the very same time, not one day later and not one day sooner.
Moreover, a Divergence does not necessarily imply that a move of con-
sequence  in  the  opposite  direction  will  ensue.  We  have  already  examined
one  comparable  instance  (in  the  spring  of  1941)  which  resulted  otherwise.
Logically, also, if a failure to conﬁrm such as occurred in 1942 is to be taken
as  an  indication  of  a  turn  in  trend,  then  its  opposite,  i.e.,  conﬁrmation  or
reafﬁrmation by both Averages, should argue with equal force against a turn
in trend. Yet the simple truth is that many more Major Reversals have come
when the Averages were in agreement than when they were divergent. We
have no wish to belabor the point or waste the reader’s time, but we do feel
that he should be warned against the wishful thinking that every “failure to
conﬁrm” seems to inspire when the market is in a Bear Trend.

To return to our history, the Averages closed at 125.88 and 29.51, respec-
tively, on the day following our conclusive Bull Market Signal in February
1943. Theoretically, there is where an investor who followed the Dow Theory
strictly  would  have  bought  his  stocks.  (Those  who  were  satisﬁed  that  the
Primary  Trend  was  up  in  November  1942  bought  with  Averages  around
114.60 and 29.20.) It was reasonable to assume that this Bull Market, which
as yet showed few of the usual characteristics of the second phase and none
whatever  of  the  third  phase,  would  continue  for  some  time  to  come.  The
next 4 months produced no market developments that required interpreta-
tive attention, and we can move on to the events of July. Figure 6 charts the
action from July 1, 1943, to January 31, 1944.

The First Correction

After  closing  at  145.82  on  July  14,  1943,  the  Industrial Average  drifted  off.
The Rails pushed up to a new high (38.30) 10 days later, but the Industrials
refused to join in the rally and then both indexes cracked down sharply for
7  sessions.  Turnover  increased  and  the  decline  was  the  greatest  that  had

Daily  closing  prices  of  Dow–Jones  Industrial  and  Rail Averages,  and

occurred in the Bull Market up to that date. But, everyone realized that the
market, after several months of quite persistent advance, was “entitled to a
correction.” In neither duration nor extent could this down move be qualiﬁed
as more than a Minor Trend. Next ensued 3 months of desultory ﬂuctuation
with little net progress in either Average. The Industrials pulled up to 141.75
on September 20 and then drifted off again, while the Rails struggled back
to 35.53 on October 27. Another quick break developed in early November,
culminating in a high-volume shakeout which cut the value of the Industrials
by 3.56 points and the Rails by 1.75 on November 8. Prices rallied a little and
sold  off  again,  reaching  new  lows  (since  early  spring)  on  November 30 —
Industrials 129.57 and Rails 31.50.

There was no question now but that a full-ﬂedged Secondary Reaction
had developed. The problem for Dow interpreters was whether more than
that  was  involved.  If  the  ﬁrst  drop  in  July  could  be  construed  as  an  Inter-
mediate Trend in itself, and the August–October action as another Interme-
diate  Swing,  then  the  November  break  would  signal  a  Bear  Market.  As  a
matter of fact, no Dow theorist, so far as we know, gave very serious con-
sideration  to  any  such  interpretation.  The  July  break,  as  aforesaid,  did  not
rate as an Intermediate in either duration or points retraced; the whole move
from  July  to  November  1943  had  to  be  regarded  as  all-of-a-piece,  all  one
Secondary  Reaction.  The  real  Major  Trend  test  would  come  on  the  next
advance, whenever that should develop; if that failed to top the July peaks,
and prices thereafter declined to new lows, a Bear Market would indeed be
in effect.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

The decision was long deferred. Prices began again to move up, but the
advance in the Industrials was slow and grudging. The Rails forged ahead
more rapidly and pushed through their July Top on February 17, 1944, going
on  to  a  Minor  Peak  at  40.48  on  March  21.  The  Industrial Average  attained
141  on  March  13,  but  still  nearly  5  points  below  its  “signal”  level,  faltered
and  fell  back.  Here  was  another  striking  case  of  “failure  to  conﬁrm.”  For
those who chose to assign grave signiﬁcance to such developments, it could
have  only  a  very  Bearish  meaning.  But  all  it  did  mean,  in  fact,  was  that
continuation of the Primary Bull Move had not as yet been conﬁrmed. Only
if both Averages now declined and closed below their respective November
30  Bottoms  would  the  new  high  registered  by  the  Rails  alone  in  February
have to be disregarded and a Primary Bear Market announced. In brief, the
situation  at  the  end  of  March  was  no  different,  so  far  as  its  Major  Trend
implications were concerned, from what it had been in early January before
the Rails pushed through.

Bull Trend Reafﬁrmed

The situation remained in doubt (but subject always to that basic presump-
tion  of  the  Dow  Theory  which  we  named  as  Number  12  in  the  preceding
chapter)  until  June  15,  1944,  when  the  Industrials  ﬁnally  came  through  to
close  at  145.86.  It  had  taken  them  4  months  to  conﬁrm  the  Rails,  almost  a
full  year  to  reafﬁrm  the  Primary  Uptrend.  The  effect  of  this  “signal”  on
traders  was  electric;  trading  volume  increased  by  650,000  shares  on  the
following day as prices jumped another full point.

The following 12 months need no detailed discussion as they produced
nothing  in  the  way  of  market  action  to  give  a  Dow  theorist  any  concern.
Prices drifted off irregularly for 9 weeks after mid-July but their net loss was
of  minor  proportions,  and  they  then  climbed  with  only  brief  interruptions
to 169.08 in the Industrial Index on May 29, 1945, and 63.06 in the Rail Index
on June 26, 1945. We should take a brief look at the period which followed,
not because it illustrates anything new in our study, but because it takes in
the surrender of Japan and the end of ﬁghting in World War II.

Figure 7  covers  the  7  months  from  May  1  to  November  30,  1945.  The
Industrials held steady for 4 weeks while the Rails were making the spurt
to their June 26 Top. On June 28, with nothing in the newspaper headlines
to account for such a radical trend change, prices broke sharply and turnover
climbed  to  nearly  three  million  shares,  the  highest  day’s  total  for  the  Bull
Market up to that time. But the Industrial Average gave ground reluctantly
thereafter,  and  by  June  26,  at  160.91  had  given  up  less  than  5%  of  its  top
price.  The  Rails  shook  down  rapidly,  however.  The  Hiroshima  bomb  was
dropped  on August  5  and  Japan  surrendered  on  the  14th.  The  Industrials
were now rallying up from their July 26 low, but the Rails couldn’t hold and
plunged again, hitting bottom ﬁnally (for this move) on August 20 at 51.48,
for a loss of more than 18% of their June peak value.

FIGURE 7. 
Daily closing price levels of the Dow–Jones Industrial and Rail Averages
from May 1 to November 30, 1945, and total daily market volume. This period, which
saw the end of World War II, produced only a moderate Secondary Correction in the
Primary Bull Market, which had already run for 3 years from its beginnings in April/
June, 1942.

The Rails Falter

Before we go on with our examination of the market action here, it is inter-
esting  to  note  that,  up  to  this  point,  the  Rail Average  had  been  the  “hero”
of our story. Starting with its refusal to go down to a new Bear Market low
in June of 1942, it was the spearhead of each important advance, had staged
the most spectacular rallies, had gained 170% in value as compared with the
Industrials’ 82%. In retrospect, the explanation is obvious: the railroads were
the  chief  business  beneﬁciaries  of  the  war.  They  were  rolling  up  proﬁts,
paying off indebtedness, and reducing their ﬁxed charges at a rate unheard
of in this generation (and probably never to be seen again). While the “pub-
lic’s” eye was on the traditional and better publicized “war industries,” the
market began, as far back as Pearl Harbor, to shrewdly appraise and discount
this  unprecedented  harvest  for  the  Rails.  But  from  here  on,  the  picture
changes and the Rails become the laggards. As we look back now, it is just
as obvious that, with equal shrewdness, the market began in July of 1945 to
discount  a  change  in  their  fortunes. An  illuminating  demonstration  of  the
basic assumption (Tenet Number 1) in Dow Theory!

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Turning back to our chart, prices began to push up again with renewed
vigor after August 20. Both Averages had experienced a Secondary Reaction
and now Dow theorists had to watch closely to see if the Primary Uptrend
would  again  be  reafﬁrmed  by  their  going  to  new  highs.  The  Industrials
“made  the  grade”  when  they  closed  at  169.89  on August  24,  but  the  Rails
had much more ground to recover and were running into offerings as they
came  up  in  succession  to  each  of  the  Minor  Bottom  levels  of  their
June–August  downtrend  (a  phenomenon  to  which  we  shall  devote  some
attention later on in the chapter on Support and Resistance). Not until early
November  1945  were  they  able  to  conﬁrm  the  signal  of  the  Industrials  by
closing above 63.06. At this point, the Averages had, once again, announced
that the Primary Bull Market was still in force. It had now lasted for three
and a half years — longer than most Bull Markets, and “third phase” signs
were  rapidly  appearing.  The  public  was  buying,  the  boardrooms  were
crowded, stock market news was making the front pages of even small city
newspapers,  the  “cats  and  dogs”  were  being  whooped  up,  business  was
booming.

With both Averages in new high ground and the Bull Market reafﬁrmed,
all previous low points could now be disregarded. For example, the 160.91
Bottom of July 26 in the Industrials and the 51.48 of August 20 in the Rails
had  no  further  signiﬁcance  in  Dow  Theory.  This  is  a  point  we  have  not
stressed heretofore, but it is important. It might, indeed, be added to our set
of rules in the preceding chapter were it not implicit in the basic tenets. Once
a  Primary  Trend  has  been  conﬁrmed  or  reconﬁrmed,  the  past  is  forgotten
and  everything  hinges  on  future  action.  At  the  end  of  1945,  with  “third
phase”  symptoms  rife,  the  action  of  the  market  had  to  be  followed  with
redoubled vigilance. The third phase could last for 2 more years (as it did
in 1927 to 1929) or be concluded at any moment. Our next chart (Figure 8)
carries us through May 1946.

The Spring of 1946

The market went through a Minor Setback in late December, a development
which  has  come  to  be  expected  as  the  normal  pattern  for  that  month  and
which is usually attributed to “tax selling” — and stormed ahead again in
January 1946. Daily volume on January 18 exceeded 3 million shares for the
ﬁrst  time  in  more  than  5  years.  During  the  ﬁrst  week  of  February,  prices
“churned” with little net change. Extreme high closes were registered during
this period by the Rail Average at 68.23 on February 5, and by the Industrial
Average  at  206.97  on  February  2.  On  February  9,  both  started  to  slide  off,
pulled  back  sharply  from  the  13th  to  the  16th,  and  then  broke  in  a  selling
wave that ran to a climax on February 26 with closings at 60.53 and 186.02,
respectively. The loss in the Industrials was the greatest in points (20.95) they
had suffered during the entire Bull Market; in the Rails, it was exceeded only
by  their  July–August  decline  of  the  previous  year.  It  amounted  to  a  little

FIGURE 8.
Daily closing price levels of the Dow–Jones Industrial and Rail Averages
from December 1, 1945, to May 31, 1946, and total daily market volume. Noteworthy
features of this period included the extremely high volume which prevailed during
January and February as compared with lower turnover in April and May, and the
laggard performance of the Rails when the Industrial Average pushed up to a new
high in April and again at the end of May. At the latter date, the February lows were
still the critical downside “signal” levels according to the Dow Theory.

more than 10% in the former and 11% in the latter, and gave up a little less
than  half  of  their  advances  from  the  1945  summer  lows.  The  decline  was
3 weeks old on February 26. It was an unqualiﬁed Intermediate — in Dow
Theory a Secondary Reaction presumptively within the still existing Major
Uptrend.

Labor troubles were dogging the steel and motor industries in 1946 from
early  January  on,  and  a  coal  strike  was  looming.  The  February  break  was
attributed to those news developments, but the ruling cause was more likely
the  discontinuance  of  margin  trading.  The  Federal  Reserve  Board  had
announced in January that after February 1, stocks could be bought only for
full 100% cash. The late January up-ﬂing was featured by the “little fellow”
seizing  his  last  chance  to  buy  on  margin.  (Those  who  participated  in  this
scramble will doubtless regret it for a long time yet to come.) Professionals
seized the opportunity to unload their trading commitments, but the “little
fellow”  was  now  temporarily  out  of  funds;  his  brokerage  account  was

quickly  “frozen.”  Under  the  circumstances,  as  we  look  back,  it  is  amazing
that a more extensive Panic did not then eventuate.

But the Dow theorist was not concerned with causes. The Bull Market
had been reafﬁrmed by both Averages in early February, canceling all pre-
vious “signal” levels. Bullish Forces were still evidently in effect because the
February  26  lows  held  and  prices  began  to  recover.  The  Industrials  came
back quickly, and by April 9 had closed in new high ground at 208.03. The
Rails dragged. When the market showed signs of weakening at the end of
April,  the  Rail  Average  was  still  nearly  5  points  below  its  early  February
high. Was this another “failure to conﬁrm” to worry about?

Final Up Thrust

The late February Bottoms were now the critical points on the downside; if
both  Averages  should  decline  below  the  Intermediate  Low  closes  then
recorded,  before  the  Rails  could  make  a  new  high  above  68.23  (in  which
event the Bullish Signal of the Industrials would be canceled), a Bear Market
would  thereby  be  signaled.  But,  despite  a  miner’s  strike  and  an  imminent
rail workers’ strike, the market turned ﬁrm again in mid-May and put forth
a surprising rally which swept the Industrial Index up to 212.50 on May 29,
1946 — a new Bull high by nearly 6 points. The Rails failed in May by only
0.17 to equal their February high close, slid back a triﬂe, and then pushed
through at last on June 13 to close at 68.31, thereby conﬁrming the Industrials
in their announcement that (as of that date) the Primary Trend was still up.
The February lows (186.02 and 60.53) now ceased to signify in Dow Theory,
but  keep  those  ﬁgures  in  mind  because  they  are  involved  in  an  argument
which raged among Dow students for months thereafter.

Figure 9  overlaps  the  preceding  picture,  taking  up  the  market’s  action
on  May  4  and  carrying  it  forward  to  October  19,  1946.  Trading  volume,  it
may be noted, in late May and early June did not come up to the levels of
either  the  late  January  to  early  February  Top  or  the  late  February  Bottom;
the market appeared to be losing vitality, an ominous, although by no means,
decisive manifestation. Prices began to fall off rapidly immediately after the
Rail  Conﬁrmation  on  June  13.  The  Industrials  rallied  for  2  weeks  in  early
July, but the Rails continued to decline; the Industrials broke again on July 15
and  the  two Averages  continued  their  slide  until  they  stood  at  195.22  and
60.41 at the close on July 23.

There,  as  it  subsequently  developed,  was  the  end  of  that  particular
Intermediate  Swing  —  one  which  in  accord  with  our  Rule  12  had  to  be
labeled a Secondary Reaction in a Bull Market until proved otherwise. The
market swung up again. It climbed slowly and steadily, but with turnover
running well under a million shares, until exactly 3 weeks later, the Indus-
trials  at  204.52  (August  13)  had  regained  a  little  more  than  half  of  their
June–July loss and the Rails at 63.12 (August 14) a little more than a third
of theirs. This advance, therefore, had met the minimum requirements of an
Intermediate  Trend.  If  prices  could  continue  to  rise  and  eventually  push

closing levels, that action would signal a Reversal of the Primary Trend.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

The Bear Market Signal

That the situation was critical was evident in the volume chart. Ever since
the  end  of  May,  turnover  had  tended  not  only  to  increase  on  the  declines
but,  what  was  much  more  important,  to  dry  up  on  the  rallies.  Compare
Figure 9 with 7 and 8, and you can see how conspicuous this phenomenon
had become by mid-August. Prices did turn down, with activity increasing
on the breaks, and on August 27, the closing prices, 191.04 for the Industrials
and 58.04 for the Rails, told a sad story. The Averages had spoken: a 4-year
Bull Market had ended, and a Bear Market was under way. A Dow investor
should  have  sold  all  his  stocks  on  the  following  day  (at  approximately
190 and 58 in terms of the two Averages).

To clear the record, it was necessary for the Dow theorist now to go back
and mark the May 29 and June 13 highs in the Industrials and Rails, respec-
tively, as the end of the Bull Market. The June–July decline then became the
ﬁrst  Primary  Swing  in  the  new  Bear  Trend,  and  the  July  23  to  August  14
advance became the ﬁrst Secondary Recovery within the Major Downtrend.
A second Primary Swing was now in process of development.

You  will  have  noted  in  the  foregoing  that  a  Bear  Market  was  signaled
as soon as both Averages penetrated their July 23 lows. Let us return now
and  take  up  that  argument  which  we  mentioned  on  the  preceding  page.
Some students of Dow Theory refused to recognize the new high of June 13
in the Rail Average as a decisive reafﬁrmation of the Bull Trend. The previous
close should be bettered by at least a full point (1.00), many argued, in order
to conﬁrm the signal previously given by the Industrials; the margin of only
0.08 was inconclusive. But this opinion, if accepted, had logical consequences
which later proved embarrassing. For, if the Bull Market had not been reaf-
ﬁrmed in June, then the critical levels on the downside remained at 186.02
in the Industrials and 60.53 in the Rails, the February 26 Bottoms. Therefore,
a Bear Market could not be “called” until those prices had been penetrated
downside by both Averages. This view acquired a large following, especially
among those who were not interested in “hair splitting” theory but wanted “to
give the market every chance in view of the still improving fundamentals.”

The market did, of course, proceed to break its February lows, and by
that  time,  the  Panic  (second  phase)  was  on.  Obviously,  in  this  case,  the
orthodox “any-penetration-whatever” school had all the best of it; they had
sold out at least 13 points higher up in terms of the Industrial Index (at least
6 in the Rails). Six weeks later, on October 9, 1946, to be exact, this second
Primary  Intermediate  Swing  ended  at  Industrials  163.12,  Rails  44.69,  and
another Intermediate Recovery Move started.

Before closing this history of 6 years of Dow Theory interpretation, we
might  note  that  the  June  13  high  in  the  Rail  Average  furnishes  a  perfect
illustration  of  the  rule  that  a  trend  can  change  any  time  after  it  has  been
conﬁrmed or reafﬁrmed, also of the diminishing odds in favor of continuance
with each successive reafﬁrmation of the Primary Trend.

chapter ﬁve

The Dow Theory’s Defects

Our readers, we suspect, heaved a deep sigh of relief when they closed the
preceding  chapter  on  a  difﬁcult,  tedious,  and,  at  times,  confusing  subject.
Some  may  even  wish  at  this  point  that  the  Dow  Theory  had  never  been
conceived.  Others  doubtless  spotted  one  or  more  of  its  real  or  supposed
defects  and  have  questions  to  ask.  Before  we  proceed  to  more  interesting
chart matters, we had better devote a few pages to clearing them up.

First,  let’s  take  up  the  charge  of  “second  guessing”  which  is  so  often
ﬂung at writers on Dow Theory. It is a charge which will continue to crop
up so long as opinions differ among Dow theorists at critical periods (which,
unfortunately, is often the case). Even the most experienced and careful Dow
analysts ﬁnd it necessary occasionally to change their interpretations when
a stand ﬁrst ventured is rendered untenable by some subsequent action of
the market. They would not attempt to deny it — but, they say, in the long
run,  surprisingly  little  is  lost  by  such  temporary  misinterpretations.  Many
of them publish their comments regularly and can refer you to the printed
ﬁles of opinions and advice expressed before and during the event, as well
as after it. As for the preceding chapter of this book, the reader, if he cares
to check such records, will ﬁnd that the interpretations given therein (aside
from  the  remarks  made  “in  retrospect”  and  so  labeled)  were  precisely  the
interpretations published at the time by the best established Dow analysts.
EN9:
While, in the modern age Richard Russell (dowtheoryletters.com) is probably
senior  in  terms  of  reputation,  a  host  of  other  Dow  Theorists  (actually  trying  to
round them up is like herding cats) inhabit the scene, among them Jack Schannep
(thedowtheory.com) and Richard Moroney (dowtheory.com) who must be taken into
account  when  consulting  the  sacred-chicken  bones.  Robert  W.  Colby  (robertw-
colby.com) is currently doing interesting work in Dow Theory. Note that it is the
chicken which is sacred, and the bones only secondarily.

The Dow Theory Is “Too Late”

This is a more valid objection. It is sometimes expressed in the rather intem-
perate  statement  that  “the  Dow  Theory  is  a  sure  ﬁre  system  for  depriving
the  investor  of  the  ﬁrst  third  and  the  last  third  of  every  Major  Move,  and
sometimes  there  isn’t  any  middle  third!”  Or,  to  give  a  speciﬁc  example:

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

A Primary Bull Market started in 1942 with the Industrial Average at 92.92
and  ended  in  1946  at  212.50,  for  a  total  gain  of  119.58 Average  points,  but
the strict Dow theorists could not buy until the Industrials were up to 125.88
and couldn’t sell until prices had already declined to 191.04, thus capturing,
at best, only about 65 points, or not much more than half of the total move.
This  speciﬁc  statement  cannot  be  disputed.  But  the  answer  to  the  general
objection is “Try and ﬁnd a man who ﬁrst bought his stocks at 92.92 (or even
within 5 points of that level) and stayed 100% long throughout the interven-
ing  years,  and  ﬁnally  sold  out  at  212.50,  or  within  5  points  thereof.”  The
reader is welcome to try; he will, in fact, ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to locate even
a dozen who did as well as the Dow Theory.

A  still  better  answer,  since  it  comprehends  all  of  the  hazards  of  every
known kind of Bull and Bear Market to date, is the overall dollars and cents
record of the past 60 years. We are indebted to Richard Durant for permission
to reprint the following computation of what would, in theory, have resulted
if  a  fund  of  only  $100  could  have  been  invested  in  the  stocks  of  the
Dow–Jones Industrial Average on July 12, 1897, when a Primary Bull Market
was signaled by the Dow Theory, and those stocks were thereafter sold and
repurchased  when,  and  only  when,  the  Dow  Theory  had  deﬁnitely  con-
ﬁrmed a change in the Major Trend (see Table 1).

In  brief,  an  investment  of  $100  in  1897  would  have  become  $11,236.65
in 1956 simply by buying the Industrial Average stocks each time the Dow
Theory announced a Bull Market and holding them until the Dow Theory
announced a Bear Market. During this period, the investor would have made
15 purchases and 15 sales, or about 1 transaction every 2 years on average.
The  record  is  not  perfect.  It  shows  one  losing  transaction  and  three
instances where reinvestment would have been made at a higher level than
the  preceding  liquidation.  But,  at  that,  it  hardly  needs  defending!  Also,  it
takes  no  account  of  commissions  and  transfer  taxes,  but  neither  does  it
include the dividends the investor would have received during the time he
held  his  stocks;  the  latter  would,  needless  to  say,  have  added  many  more
dollars to the fund.

For  the  enlightenment  of  the  man  who  believes  in  “just  buying  good
stocks and putting them away,” compare the above results with the best that
could  have  been  done  by  buying  shares  only  once  at  the  lowest  price
recorded by the Industrial Average during these entire 50 years and selling
them  only  once  at  the  highest.  $100  invested  at  the  all-time  low,  29.64  on
August  10,  1896,  would  have  become  only  $1,757.93  at  the  all-time  high,
521.05, 60 years later on April 6, 1956, as against the $11,236.65 derived from
the straight Dow Theory program.

EN: This record of the Dow Theory is updated to the year 2006 in Chapter 5.1.

The Dow Theory Is Not Infallible

Of  course,  it  isn’t.  It  depends  on  interpretation  and  is  subject  to  all  the
hazards of human interpretive ability. But, again, the record speaks for itself.

The Dow Theory Frequently Leaves the Investor in Doubt

This is true in one sense and not in another. There is never a time when the
Dow  Theory  does  not  afford  a  presumptive  answer  to  the  question  of  the
direction of the Primary Trend. That answer will be wrong for a relatively
short  time  at  the  beginning  of  each  new  Major  Swing.  There  will  also  be
times  when  a  good  Dow  analyst  should  say,  “The  Primary  Trend  is  still
presumably up, but it has reached a dangerous stage, and I cannot consci-
entiously advise you to buy now. It may be too late.”

Frequently, however, the above objection simply reﬂects the inability of
the  critic  mentally  to  accept  the  fundamental  concept  that  the  Averages
discount all the news and statistics. He doubts the Dow Theory because he

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

cannot reconcile its message with his own ideas, derived from other sources,
of what stocks should do. The theory, needless to say, is usually more nearly
right.

This criticism in other cases reﬂects nothing but impatience. There may
be weeks or months (as, for example, during the formation of a Line) when
the Dow Theory cannot “talk.” The active trader quite naturally rebels. But
patience is a virtue in the stock market as elsewhere — in fact, essential if
serious mistakes are to be avoided.

The Dow Theory Does Not Help the Intermediate 
Trend Investor

This  is  perfectly  true.  The  theory  gives  little  or  no  warning  of  changes  in
Intermediate  Trend. Yet,  if  a  fair  share  of  these  can  be  captured,  the  proﬁt
amounts to more than can be derived from the Primary Trend alone. Some
traders  have  worked  out  supplementary  rules  based  on  Dow  principles
which they apply to Intermediate Movements, but these have not proved to
be satisfactory. The remainder of our book is devoted to a better approach
to this problem.

The  Dow  Theory  is  a  mechanical  device,  designed  to  tell  the  direction
of the Primary Market Trend, which is important because, as we said at the
beginning  of  this  study,  most  stocks  tend  to  go  with  the  trend.  The  Dow
Theory does not and cannot tell you which individual stocks to buy, aside
from those stocks which make up the averages themselves. That, again, is a
problem for the remainder of this book.

EN: An Old Criticism, obsolete in Modern Markets. The Dow Theory does not
tell you which stocks to buy. True at the time Edwards wrote this. But in modern
markets the investor can buy substitute instruments which almost perfectly mimic
its behavior (DIA). As it is possible to trade in surrogates for the Dow Averages in
present markets, see Chapter 15.1.

The Dow Theory in the 20th 
and 21st Centuries

As may be seen in the following table, replacing the table from Chapter 5,
the  Dow  Theory  continued  to  provide  its  user  an  advantage  over  the
unaware  Buy-and-Hold  Investor.  From  its  original  investment  of  $100  in
by December
1897 the Theory investment would have grown to $345,781.94
31, 2005, with the long trade still open. The table below shows the details,
including the post-2000 bust drawdown. To my mind this table is a powerful
demonstration of the power of methodical technical investing.

By contrast, the investment of $100, if bought at the low, 29.64, and sold at

the historic high, 11762.71, in January 2000 would have grown to $39,685.03.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

I am indebted to Jack Schannep of 
 (www.thedowtheory.
com) for the data recapitulated here. At that URL an enlightening exposition
of the Theory and its record may be found — much more complete than that
which is found here outside of Edwards’ magisterial presentation.

The Dow Theory.Com

Minor discrepancies are acknowledged within these and others’ data, a
point which will be raised by purists. This is occasioned by disagreements
within the priestly circles of those who keep the sacred records. That is, not
all  theorists  are  in  100%  agreement  as  to  the  exact  date  or  nature  of  the
signals. (Some will say the reentry date of October 1, 1956, should have been
October  7,  1957,  for  example.)  Meaning,  of  course,  that  some  judgment  is
involved  in  interpretation  of  the  entrails.  The  Dow  Theory  is  not  a  100%
objective  algorithm,  just  as  chart  analysis  is  not  reducible  to  an  objective
algorithm. (I am allowed to jest at the priesthood as I am a junior acolyte in
these matters. It would not be seemly for the uninitiated to burlesque.)

In brief, an investment of $100 in 1897 would have become $345,781.94
simply by buying the Industrial Average stocks each time the Dow Theory
announced  a  Bull  Market  and  holding  them  until  the  Dow  Theory
announced a Bear Market, then selling. 

The Technical Investor would have had this amount in pocket marked
to  market  at  the  end  of  2005  as  opposed  to  the  $39,685.03  of  his  dozing
counterpart, or the Trust Department of the Rip Van Winkle Bank of Sleepy
Hollow. And, in addition, he would not have been deliquidiﬁed during Bear
Markets.

Whether or not the Dow Theory retains its validity over the market as
a whole, there can be no question that it still calls the turn for its sector of
the market, which as Jack Schannep correctly notes, has ﬁve times the cap-
italization of the NASDAQ.

As Mark Twain observed, everybody talks about the Dow Theory, but
nobody  does  anything  about  it.  Perhaps  that  is  not  precisely  what  Twain
said,  but  close  enough  for  government  work.  As  further  inquiry  into  the
inner workings of the Theory I have initiated a series of studies of the record
with Brian Brooker, MS Finance, Golden Gate University. Following are some
of the results of our study, from the monograph,

51

It  seems  obvious  that  the  risk  characteristics  of  Dow  Theory  investing
are  unique,  and  I  will  belabor  the  obvious.  The  Buy-and-Hold  Investor
mentioned  above  for  comparison  with  the  Dow  Theory  Investor  not  only
realized  less  proﬁt  over  the  period  of  his  investment;  he  also  experienced
greatly expanded risk over the life of the investment. At ﬁrst blush all the
proﬁts garnered by the Reversing Investor in the table above represent risk
actually  experienced  by  the  Buy-and-Hold  Investor.  But  that  is  only  ﬁrst
blush.  A  little  deeper  thought  reveals  that  the  true  extent  of  the
Buy-and-Hold  Investor’s  risk  is  measured  by  maximum  drawdowns  over
any given period of time. It is not necessary to theorize about this question.
The measurement is empirical.

When viewed in perspective these risks are startling. From the top in 2000
to  the  low  in  2002  a  39%  drawdown  occurred.  Is  this  disquieting?  A  41%
drawdown occurred during the Reagan crash of 1987. A mere bagatelle. The
drawdown from 1929 to 1932 was 89%. Of course such things are unlikely to
happen again. The big guys would step in and support the market. 

Clearly the way to reduce market risk to zero is to be out of the market.
Less  obviously,  or  perhaps  blatantly,  the  second  most  important  way  to
reduce risk is to be right the trend — or not to be wrong. And in fact because
of the nature of the Theory much time is spent on the sidelines by the Dow
Investor. A  natural  reduction  of  risk.  In  fact  of  the  total  days  from  1897  to
2006, 39,493, the Dow Investor spent 14,378 (or about 37% of the time) days
at the beach or at the S&L. But his accumlated proﬁts have not been credited
with interest as this is a “pure” study.

As will be readily apparent Table 1.2 is much richer in data than just the
duration of investments in the long side of the market. Acting on the maxim
(my own) that it is unwise to invest on only one side of the market I have
computed  the  accumulated  proﬁts  gained  by  trading  the  Dow  long  and
short. After all the market goes down as well up, and for a reversing system
a liquidation of longs is a signal to go short. If the record on the long side
is impressive, showing accumulated proﬁts to 2006 of $345,781.94, how much
more impressive is the accumulated proﬁt of $1,902,859 garnered from trad-
ing both sides of the Dow, long and short.

The  reader  who  listens  carefully  will  hear  the  meta  message  here.  For
the great majority of investors it is the long run which is important. In the
“right now” culture of the Internet and the computer and get rich quick one
wonders  if  there  are  still  such  investors,  outside  of  the  very  rich  and  very
intelligent. Perhaps there are still a few aged readers of early editions of this
book. And, not to despair, perhaps some new converts.

In  Figures  9.1  and  9.2  I  practice  what  I  preach.  I  post  historical  Dow
Theory buy and sell signals on the Dow chart. I am constantly urging stu-
dents  and  clients  to  take  the  chart  of  an  issue  they  have  done  poorly  (or
well)  in  and  post  their  trades  on  it.  The  mere  examination  of  this  kind  of
chart  should  be  an  enlightening  experience.  When  this  exercise  is  accom-
plished  the  investor  may  see  whether  in  fact  he  is  operating  according  to

sound methods. Sound Methods being, in the opinion of this book and this
Editor, mid- to long-term trend following methods. 

Further, these charts of the Dow Theory method may be compared with
Figures 210 and 210.1 showing the use of Basing Points and the reader will
have  extensive  cases  of  two  methods  for  following  the  market  in  addition
to the chart analysis methods prevalent thoughout the book. 

Robert  W.  Colby  (robertwcolby.com),  a  member  of  the  Market  Techni-
cians Association (mta.org), in a paper published by that organization (and
available at his website), explored many objective algorithms for duplicating
the  performance  of  Dow  Theory.  Among  these  is  a  naturalistic  channel
breakout algorithm which I ﬁnd worth further investigation. I will quote the
rules  here  without  further  comment,  reminding  the  reader  that  no  (repeat
NO) system should EVER be backed with money until the trader has exhaus-
tively vetted it. Colby’s algorithm:

1. Enter Long (Buy) when INDU rises to a new 9-trading day high and

TRAN rises to a new 39-trading day high. 

2. Close Long (Sell) when INDU falls to a new 22-trading day low and

TRAN falls to a new 166-trading day low. 

3. Enter  Short  (Sell  Short)  when  INDU  falls  to  a  new  22-trading  day

low and TRAN falls to a new 166-trading day low. 

4. Close Short (Cover) when INDU rises to a new 36-trading day high

and TRAN rises to a new 32-trading day high.

Important Reversal Patterns

In our discussion of certain deﬁciencies in the Dow Theory from the point
of view of the practical trader, we mentioned the fact that it did not tell us
(EN9:  Obviously  no  longer  a  problem  as  the
what  speciﬁc  stocks  to  trade  in. 
investor may buy the DIA and trade the Average like a stock
)
 A conservative and
.
wealthy investor, more interested in safety than maximum proﬁt, can solve
this problem by making up a comprehensive and thoroughly diversiﬁed list
of sound, well-seasoned “blue chip” issues and handing his broker an order
to  buy  the  lot  when  the  Dow  Theory  signals  a  Bull  Trend.  Some  of  his
selections will do better than others; some may “go sour,” but wide diver-
siﬁcation will ensure his getting a fair Average result. Better results should
be obtained if we can ﬁnd a way to select for purchase the most favorably
situated  issues  at  any  given  time,  and  can  manage  to  sell  them  promptly
and  switch  to  others  whenever  the  prospects  for  the  ﬁrst  have  been  fully
discounted.

There is the possibility, too, of increasing our gains if we can, at times,
buy with safety earlier in an uptrend than the Dow theorist does, and sell
before the market has reacted far enough to give a Dow Bear Signal.

We mentioned also the fact that the Dow Theory is of little or no assis-
tance in trading on the Intermediate Trends. There is obviously more money
to be made if we can get the beneﬁt of all of each up move without having
to  write  off  some  of  our  proﬁts  in  each  reaction.  Or  if  we  can  proﬁt  both
ways by trading on both the “long side” and “short side” of the market.

Finally, although all stocks tend to move with “the market” as typiﬁed
in the Averages, there are in fact wide variations in the price paths of indi-
vidual  issues. An  average,  after  all,  is  just  that,  a  device  for  expressing  in
one ﬁgure a diversity of other ﬁgures. A Primary Bull Market ended in the
Dow–Jones Industrial Average on May 29, 1946; but United Air Lines regis-
tered  its  highest  price  in  December  1945;  General  Motors  saw  its  peak  in
January 1946; Goodyear in April, DuPont in June, and Schenley in August.
Is there a way of capitalizing on these Divergences?

Technical analysis of the charts of individual stocks deﬁnitely answers
the ﬁrst and most important of these four problems, the matter of selection.
It frequently, but not always, gives us a running start on the Dow Theory;
it  also,  in  large  part,  takes  care  of  the  question  of  the  Intermediate  Trend,
although  there  are  certain  reservations  as  to  policy  and  risk  in  connection
with both these points which will be taken up in due course. Finally, careful

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

technical  analysis  should,  in  nearly  every  case,  get  us  out  of  a  stock  that
“tops out” ahead of the Averages long before it has suffered any considerable
decline,  often  in  time  to  transfer  funds  to  other  issues  which  have  yet  to
complete their advances.

Just as the Averages constantly discount all known and foreseeable fac-
tors affecting the future of security prices in general, in the same way does
the  market  action  of  an  individual  issue  reﬂect  all  the  factors  affecting  its
individual future. Among these factors, and, expressed in its chart, are the
general  market  conditions  which  inﬂuence  all  stocks  to  a  greater  or  lesser
degree, as well as the particular conditions applying to the particular stock,
including the operations of “insiders.”

(EN9: and wind up in prison)

Let us assume right from the start that you, the reader, are not a member
of that mysterious inner circle known to the boardrooms as “the insiders.”
Such a group — genuinely entitled to be called insiders, thoroughly informed
on every fact, ﬁgure, and development that might determine the fortunes of
a  certain  corporation  —  may  exist  from  time  to  time,  may  inﬂuence  the
. But it is fairly certain
market price of its stock 
that there are not nearly so many “insiders” as the amateur trader supposes,
and  that  they  do  not  cause  one  tenth  of  the  market  movements  for  which
the public blames them. It is even more certain that insiders can be wrong;
they would, in fact, be the ﬁrst to admit it. Frequently, their plans are upset
by some development which they could not foresee, or by some blind force
which  puts  to  scorn  all  expert  estimates  of  value. Any  success  they  have,
however,  can  be  accomplished  only  by  buying  and  selling  on  the  ﬂoor  of
(EN9: No longer strictly true. Insiders sold stock to their companies
the Exchange. 
Still, only an
in the tulip bubble which went unreported publicly for up to a year
. 
isolated problem.) 
They can do neither without altering the delicate poise of
supply  and  demand  which  governs  prices.  Whatever  they  do  is  sooner  or
later reﬂected on the charts where you, the “outsider,” can detect it. Or detect,
at least, the way in which the supply–demand equation is being affected by
insiders’  operations  plus  all  other  prevailing  market  factors.  So,  you  don’t
need to be an insider in order frequently to ride with them.

Important Reversal Patterns

Stock  prices  move  in  trends.  Some  of  those  trends  are  straight,  some  are
curved; some are brief and some are long-continued; some are irregular or
poorly deﬁned and others are amazingly regular or “normal,” produced in
a  series  of  action  and  reaction  waves  of  great  uniformity.  Sooner  or  later,
these  trends  change  direction;  they  may  reverse  (as  from  up  to  down)  or
they may be interrupted by some sort of sideways movement and then, after
a time, proceed again in their former direction.

In  most  cases,  when  a  price  trend  is  in  the  process  of  Reversal,  either
from up to down or from down to up, a characteristic area or “pattern” takes
shape on the chart, becomes recognizable as a Reversal Formation. Some of
these chart pictures are built and completed very quickly, while others may

Important Reversal Patterns

57

require several weeks to reach a stage where one can surely say that a reversal
of  trend  is  deﬁnitely  indicated.  Speaking  in  broad  generalities,  the  greater
the Reversal Area — the wider the price ﬂuctuations within it, the longer it
takes  to  build,  the  more  shares  transferred  during  its  construction  —  the
more  important  its  implications.  Thus,  roughly  speaking,  a  big  Reversal
Formation suggests a big move to follow and a small pattern, a small move.
Needless  to  say,  the  ﬁrst  and  most  important  task  of  the  technical  chart
analyst is to learn to know the important Reversal Formations and to judge
what they may signify in terms of trading opportunities.

There  is  one  recognized  Reversal  Pattern  which  appears  and  is  com-
pleted  within  a  single  day’s  trading,  and  is,  in  consequence,  named  the
“One-Day Reversal.” There are times when it has great signiﬁcance as calling
a  halt,  at  least  temporarily,  to  any  up  or  down  move,  but  in  its  ordinary
manifestations it does not imply much of an immediate move in the opposite
direction. It is a useful pattern and we shall have more to say about it later.
But the price formations from which extensive new trends proceed take time
to build. One does not bring instantly to a stop a heavy car moving at 70 miles
an  hour  and,  all  within  the  same  split  second,  turn  it  around  and  get  it
moving back down the road in the opposite direction at 70 miles an hour.

Time Required to Reverse Trend

But we do not need to lean on a racing automobile analogy to explain why
it takes time (and volume and price action) to produce an important Trend
Reversal. The logic of it is plain enough, if we take but a moment to examine
it. We can do so most easily by describing what might have (and, doubtless,
many  times  has)  happened  in  speciﬁc  terms.  Suppose  a  certain
(EN9: A congerie of mutual funds, for
well-informed and well-ﬁnanced coterie 
example.) 
decides that the shares of a certain company, now selling around
40,  are  cheap,  that  this  company’s  affairs  are  progressing  so  satisfactorily
that, before long, it will attract the attention of many investors and its stock
will  be  in  demand  at  much  higher  levels,  perhaps  at  60  or  65.  Our  group
realizes  that  if  they  manage  their  market  operations  skillfully,  if  nothing
unforeseen intervenes to upset their calculations, they can “take” 20 points
out of the situation. So they proceed to buy in all offerings, going about this
business  as  quietly  as  possible,  until  they  have  accumulated  their  “line,”
which  may  run  to  several  thousand  shares  and  represent  practically  all  of
the  current  ﬂoating  supply  of  the  issue.  Then  they  wait.  Presently,  profes-
sionals become suspicious and the rumor circulates that there is “something
doing  in  PDQ,”  or  other  canny  bargain  hunters  discover  the  company’s
bright  prospects,  or  chart  analysts  detect  the  signs  of  accumulation  in  the
stock’s action. Buyers now ﬁnd that the stock is scarce; there are few offerings
on the books and they have to raise their bids to get it. An advance starts.
The  up-move  gathers  momentum  as  more  and  more  traders  are
attracted  by  rising  prices.  It  is  helped  along  by  the  good  reports  (higher
earnings,  increased  dividend,  etc.)  which  our  group  knew  were  to  be

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

expected. Eventually, prices approach the level at which they had planned
to take proﬁts. But this operation, the “distribution” of their holdings, may
require even more patient and skillful handling than did the accumulation.
Suppose  they  have  20,000  shares  to  unload.  They  cannot  throw  all  on  the
market  at  once;  to  do  so  would  defeat  their  own  ends  immediately  and,
perhaps, permanently. They must feed their line out little by little, trying to
avoid attention, feeling their way along and never permitting a surplus of
offerings to kill the demand. If activity in their stock has reached a level of,
say, 2000 shares transferred daily, they may be able to dispose of 500 shares
a  day  from  their  holdings  without  bringing  the  price  down.  (They  will  be
competing, sooner or later, with others who have followed their play, who
bought lower down and will be ready to take proﬁts as soon as the advance
shows  signs  of  weakening.)  So  they  start  to  sell  when  the  rising  Trend
appears  to  have  attained  maximum  momentum,  or  as  it  nears  their  price
objective,  but  well  before  it  has  reached  its  probable  limit,  and  they  push
out their shares as rapidly as buyers will take them.

Before long, as a rule — before they have distributed their entire line —
a lull in demand will occur. Perhaps prospective buyers sense the increase
in supply. A reaction develops. Our group quickly ceases selling, withdraws
its  offers,  perhaps  even  buys  back  a  few  shares  to  support  prices  if  they
threaten  to  drop  too  far.  With  supply  temporarily  held  off  the  market,  the
decline halts and the advance resumes. Our group lets it proceed this time
until it carries prices into new high ground; this reassures other holders and
brings  in  more  buyers.  As  soon  as  the  pot  is  once  again  merrily  boiling,
distribution  is  started  anew  and,  if  the  maneuver  has  been  well  directed,
completed in perhaps 2 or 3 weeks, before the second wave of demand has
been exhausted.

Our  group  is  now  out  of  its  stock  with  a  nice  proﬁt;  its  20,000  shares
have  passed  into  other  hands.  If  they  gauged  the  market  correctly  and
distributed  their  line  at  a  price  about  as  high  as  the  situation  would  bear,
demand will have been satiated for a long time to come. Prices will probably
ﬁrst drift back to somewhere near the level where they were supported on
the previous dip, then rally feebly on the strength of a little new buying from
traders  who  were  waiting  for  just  such  a  Minor  Reaction,  meet  sales  from
other traders who failed to seize the opportunity to take their proﬁts on the
preceding volume Top and are now anxious to get out, and then break down
into a decline of Intermediate or Major proportions.

You  can  see  now  why,  under  one  speciﬁc  set  of  circumstances,  a  Top
area, a chart pattern of distribution, takes time and volume to complete. But,
it doesn’t matter whether we have to deal with the highly organized oper-
ations  of  a  single  group  of  insiders  or  of  an  investment  syndicate  or,  as  is
more often the case, with the quite unorganized activities of all the investors
variously interested in an issue. The result is pretty much the same. Distri-
bution, which is simply the Street’s way of expressing the process of supply
overcoming demand, takes time and a change in ownership (turnover) of a

59

large  number  of  shares.  And  it  is  amazing  to  see  how  these  patterns  of
distribution, which hereafter we shall ﬁnd it simpler to refer to as “Tops,”
tend to assume certain well-deﬁned forms. Most of the same pattern forms
appear also as “Bottoms,” in which manifestation they signify accumulation,
of course, instead of distribution.

The Head-and-Shoulders

If you followed closely and were able successfully to visualize how the fore-
going  example  of  distribution  would  appear  on  a  chart,  you  saw  a
Head-and-Shoulders Top Formation. This is one of the more common and, by
all odds, the most reliable of the Major Reversal Patterns. Probably you have
heard it mentioned, for there are many traders who are familiar with its name,
but  not  so  many  who  really  know  it  and  can  distinguish  it  from  somewhat
similar price developments which do not portend a real Reversal of Trend.

The  typical  or,  if  you  will,  the  ideal  Head-and-Shoulders  Top  is  illus-

trated in Diagram 2. You can easily see how it got its name. It consists of:

A. A strong rally, climaxing a more or less extensive advance, on which
trading volume becomes very heavy, followed by a Minor Recession
on which volume runs considerably less than it did during the days
of rise and at the Top. This is the “left shoulder.”

B. Another high-volume advance which reaches a higher level than the
top  of  the  left  shoulder,  and  then  another  reaction  on  less  volume
which takes prices down to somewhere near the bottom level of the
preceding recession, somewhat lower perhaps or somewhat higher,
but, in any case, below the top of the left shoulder. This is the “Head.”
C. A third rally, but this time on decidedly less volume than accompa-
nied the formation of either the left shoulder or the head, which fails
to reach the height of the head before another decline sets in. This is
the “right shoulder.”

D. Finally, decline of prices in this third recession down through a line
(the “neckline”) drawn across the Bottoms of the reactions between
the left shoulder and head, and the head and right shoulder, respec-
tively, and a close below that line by an amount approximately equiv-
alent to 3% of the stock’s market price. This is the “conﬁrmation” or
“breakout.”

Note that each and every item cited in A, B, C, and D is essential to a
valid Head-and-Shoulders Top Formation. The lack of any one of them casts
in doubt the forecasting value of the pattern. In naming them, we have left
the  way  clear  for  the  many  variations  that  occur  (for  no  two  Head-and-
Shoulders are exactly alike) and have included only the features which must
be present if we are to depend upon the pattern as signaling an important
Reversal of Trend. Let us examine them in greater detail.

First, the matter of volume. It is always to be watched as a vital part of the
total picture. The chart of trading activity makes a pattern just as does the
chart  of  price  ranges.  The  two  go  together  and  each  must  conform  to  the
requirements  of  the  case.  But  note  also  that  volume  is  relative.  When  we
speak of high volume, we mean a rate of trading notably greater than has
been customary in that particular stock during that particular period under
examination. The exact number of shares traded is not important, nor will
it ordinarily signify anything for our purposes to compare a daily volume
of, say, 6500 shares in Radio Corporation with 500 in Bohn Aluminum and

FIGURE 10.
Starting in March, “HUM” formed a broad Head-and-Shoulders Top
pattern on the daily chart. August’s decline penetrated the neckline by 3%, conﬁrm-
ing  the  Reversal  Pattern.  The  minimum  objective  for  the  Head-and-Shoulders  Top
would be 18.

Brass.  The  former  may  be  very  low  and  the  latter  very  high  as  judged  by
the  proper  technical  criterion  which  is,  in  each  case,  the  average  recent
activity in the same issue. In the case of a Head-and-Shoulders Top, we have
said that high volume attends the making of the left shoulder; so, this means
that  activity  on  the  rise  to  and  at  the  Top  of  the  left  shoulder  should  be
greater than on the preceding rally waves in the same issue, then a Minor
Recession on dwindling activity, and then a new advance on high volume.
The action thus far does not differ from what we should expect of normal
wave development within a continuing uptrend. In these respects, any two
typical, successively higher waves in an advance may, as you can see, become
the left shoulder and head, respectively, of a Head-and-Shoulders Reversal.
The ﬁrst suggestion that a Head-and-Shoulders is really developing may
come when the volume record shows that activity accompanying the most
recent Top was somewhat less than on the one preceding it. If this volume
disparity is conspicuous, and if it becomes evident from the way prices are
receding that the second and higher rally has ended, then the chart should
be tabbed with a “red” signal and further developments closely scrutinized.
But  such  a  preliminary  warning  does  not  always  appear,  nor  should  it  be
taken as conclusive when it does appear. Roughly estimated, about one third

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

of all conﬁrmed Head-and-Shoulders Formations show more volume on the
left shoulder than on the head, another third show about equal volume, and
the ﬁnal third show greater volume on the head than on the left shoulder.
Another warning — or, more often, the ﬁrst — comes when prices drop
in the course of the second reaction (i.e., from the head) below the level of
the  Top  of  the  left  shoulder.  Such  action,  as  we  shall  see  later  on  in  our
speciﬁc study of Support and Resistance levels, is signiﬁcant of weakness in
the price structure. So far it is Minor; it may be only temporary; it is certainly
not conclusive. Nevertheless, when this occurs, put a double red tab on your
chart.

Breaking the Neckline

The  real  tip-off  appears  when  activity  fails  to  pick  up  appreciably  on  the
third  rally,  the  right  shoulder.  If  the  market  remains  dull  as  prices  recover
(at which stage you can draw a tentative “neckline” on your chart) and if,
as they approach the approximate level of the left shoulder Top and begin
to round over, volume is still relatively small, your Head-and-Shoulders Top
is at least 75% completed. Although the speciﬁc application of these pattern
studies  in  trading  tactics  is  the  province  of  the  second  part  of  this  book,  we
may note here that many stock traders sell or switch just as soon as they are
sure a low-volume right shoulder has been completed, without waiting for the
ﬁnal conﬁrmation which we named under D as the breaking of the neckline.
Nevertheless,  the  Head-and-Shoulders  is  not  complete,  and  an  impor-
tant  Reversal  of  Trend  is  not  conclusively  signaled  until  the  neckline  has
been penetrated downside by a decisive margin. Until the neckline is broken,
a  certain  percentage  of  Head-and-Shoulders  developments,  perhaps  20%,
are  “saved”;  i.e.,  prices  go  no  lower,  but  simply  ﬂounder  around  listlessly
for  a  period  of  time  in  the  general  range  of  the  right  shoulder,  eventually
ﬁrm up, and renew their advance.

Finally, it must be said that, in rare cases, a Head-and-Shoulders Top is
conﬁrmed by a decisive neckline penetration and still prices do not go down
much farther. “False moves” such as this are the most difﬁcult phenomena
with which the technical analyst has to cope. Fortunately, in the case of the
Head-and-Shoulders, they are extremely rare. The odds are so overwhelm-
ingly in favor of the downtrend continuing once a Head-and-Shoulders has
been  conﬁrmed  that  it  pays  to  believe  the  evidence  of  the  chart  no  matter
how  much  it  may  appear  to  be  out  of  accord  with  the  prevailing  news  or
market psychology.

There is one thing that can be said and is worth noting about Head-and-
Shoulders  Formations  that  fail  completion  or  produce  false  conﬁrmations.
Such  developments  almost  never  occur  in  the  early  stages  of  a  Primary
Advance.  A  Head-and-Shoulders  that  does  not  “work”  is  a  warning  that,
even though there is still some life in the situation, a genuine turn is near.
The next time something in the nature of a Reversal Pattern begins to appear
on the charts it is apt to be ﬁnal.

Variations in Head-and-Shoulders Tops

There is a tendency, surprising when one thinks of all the vagaries of news
and  crosscurrents  which  may  inﬂuence  day-to-day  trading,  for  Head-and-
Shoulders Patterns to develop a high degree of symmetry. The neckline tends
to  be  horizontal  and  the  right  shoulder  tends  to  resemble  the  left  in  price
conﬁrmation (although not, of course, in volume); there is a sort of satisfying
balance to the overall picture. But symmetry is not essential to a signiﬁcant
Head-and-Shoulders development. The neckline may slope up (from left to
right) or down. The only qualiﬁcation on an up-sloping neckline is that the
Bottom  of  the  recession  between  the  head  and  right  shoulder  must  form
appreciably  below  the  general  level  of  the  Top  of  the  left  shoulder.  It  is
sometimes said that a down-sloping neckline indicates an unusually weak
situation. This is so obvious that it is apt to be given even more weight than
it deserves. A share of that excessive weakness, it should be noted, will have
already  been  discharged  by  the  time  the  down-sloping  pattern  is  formed
and prices have broken the neckline. The measuring formula which we shall
discuss later applies to such situations.

Because  of  the  tendency  toward  symmetry  in  shoulder  development,
some traders, as soon as the neckline has formed, will draw on their charts

FIGURE 12.
Bull Market Top of Westinghouse Electric in 1946 was the “wideswing-
ing,” powerful type of Head-and-Shoulders (S-H-S). Decline that broke neckline (NL)
on February 13 produced a Breakaway Gap (G) discussed in Chapter 12. Measuring
formula  (see  following  pages)  called  for  initial  decline  to  33.  The  possible  Bottom
Head-and- Shoulders pattern (S?-H?-S?) formed in March was never completed (see
Chapter 7). Note failure of prices to push up through neckline of latter at any time,
despite several rally efforts in late spring while general market Averages were actu-
ally  reaching  new  high  levels.  By  the  following  November,  “WX”  had  broken  on

a  line  parallel  to  the  neckline,  extending  from  the  top  of  the  left  shoulder
through  the  head  and  on  to  the  right.  This  furnishes  a  guide  as  to  the
approximate  height  that  the  right  shoulder  rally  should  attain  and,  conse-
quently, a selling level. But you will not see very many formations as perfect
and symmetrical as our ideal picture, a fact which the several actual exam-
ples  accompanying  this  chapter  amply  illustrate.  Either  shoulder  may,  in
fact, go higher or take more time than the other. Either or both may come
up nearly to the level of the head (but not equal it, else no Head-and-Shoul-
ders) or both may fall considerably short of it. If activity attending the right
shoulder is abnormally dull, that shoulder is apt to be low but protracted in
time.  In  general,  there  seems  to  be  a  balanced  relation  between  the  three
elements of price pattern, time, and volume which is practically impossible
to express in words or ﬁgures, but which one comes with experience to sense
in its development. However, there are no “laws” beyond those stated in our
A, B, C, and D; within those limits, look for an inﬁnity of minor variations.

FIGURE 13.
A large Head-and-Shoulders Topping Pattern evolved in “TDY” over
5  months,  with  December’s  high-volume  plunge  through  the  neckline  conﬁrming
the Trend Reversal. Since this was a very expensive stock, you might have considered
buying the April 260 puts instead of selling “TDY” shares outright. Our measured
objective in this issue was 44 points from penetration of the 264 neckline, or 220.

Price Action Following Conﬁrmation: 
The Measuring Formula

The  ﬁnal  step,  the  downside  penetration  of  the  neckline,  may  be  attended
by some increase in activity, but usually isn’t at ﬁrst. If volume remains small
for  a  few  days  as  prices  drift  lower,  a  “Pullback”  move  frequently  ensues
which  brings  quotations  up  again  to  the  neckline  level  (rarely  through  it).
Normally,  this  is  the  “last  gasp”;  prices  then  turn  down  quickly,  as  a  rule,
and break away on a sharply augmented turnover. Whether or not a Pullback
Rally  will  occur  after  the  initial  penetration  seems  often  to  depend  on  the
condition of the market in general. If the whole market trend is turning down
at  the  same  time  as  our  individual  issue,  which  has  just  completed  its
Head-and-Shoulders, there will probably be no Pullback; prices instead will
tend  to  accelerate  their  decline,  with  activity  increasing  as  they  leave  the
vicinity  of  the  Top.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  general  market  is  still  ﬁrm,
then an attempt at a Pullback is likely. Also, the odds seem slightly to favor
a Pullback if the neckline has been broken before much of a right shoulder

“ICX”  was  in  a  powerful  uptrend  for  over  a  decade  and  gains  were
spectacular. But the upward momentum began to fade and Topping indications were
evident. The August peak fulﬁlled the objective of the measuring Flag formed during
1985.  The  August  gap  to  new  highs  was  quickly  ﬁlled,  indicating  that  it  was  an
Exhaustion  Gap.  The  reaction  back  to  Support,  followed  by  a  slow,  relatively  low-
volume rally to the July high, formed a credible right shoulder. The ﬁnal week’s high-
volume plunge through the neckline conﬁrmed the Reversal. The minimum objective
for  the  Head-and-Shoulders  Pattern  was  19

alternative cover point was the Bottom of the Flag at 14

developed, but certainly no very sure rules can be laid down. In any event,
the Pullback Rally is of practical interest chieﬂy to the trader who wants to
sell the stock short, or who has sold it short and has then to decide where
he should place a stop-loss order.

Now we come to one of the most interesting features of this basic Rever-
sal Formation — the indication which it gives as to the extent (in points) of
the move which is likely to follow the completion of a Head-and-Shoulders.
Measure the number of points down vertically from the Top of the head to
the neckline as drawn on the chart. Then measure the same distance down
from  the  neckline  at  the  point  where  prices  ﬁnally  penetrated  it  following
the  completion  of  the  right  shoulder.  The  price  level  thus  marked  is  the
minimum probable objective of the decline.

FIGURE  15.
Reversal  Formations,  which  develop  in  important  stocks  while  the
general market is still apparently in a strong trend, are often difﬁcult to believe, much
less  act  upon.  But  they  may  be  highly  signiﬁcant.  DuPont  topped  out  in  1936,
4 months ahead of the Averages. Despite its extended right shoulder (but note vol-
ume),  Reversal  implications  were  clear  on  December  19.  The  Pullback  of  January,
meeting supply at the old neckline level, and the second try in March were interesting
and typical of such a general market situation. Compare with Figure 12.

Let  us  hasten  to  state  one  important  qualiﬁcation  to  the  Head-and-
Shoulders Measuring Formula. Refer back to our original set of speciﬁcations
for a Head-and-Shoulders. Under A, we required “strong rally climaxing a
more or less extensive advance.” If the up-move preceding the formation of
a  Reversal  Area  has  been  small,  the  down-move  following  it  may,  in  fact
probably  will,  be  equally  small.  In  brief,  a  Reversal  Pattern  has  to  have
something to reverse. So, we really have two minimums, one being the extent
of the advance preceding the formation of the Head-and-Shoulders and the
other that derived by our measuring formula; whichever is the smaller will
apply.  The  measuring  rule  is  indicated  on  several  of  the  examples  that
illustrate this chapter. You can see now why a down-sloping neckline indi-
cates a “weaker” situation than an up-sloping, and just how much weaker,
as well as the fact that more than half of the minimum expected weakness
has  already  been  expended  in  the  decline  from  the  Top  of  the  head  to  the
penetration of the neckline.

The maximum indications are quite another matter, for which no simple
rules  can  be  laid  down.  Factors  that  enter  into  this  are  the  extent  of  the

in March. Study this picture in connection with “ED’s” long-range chart (Figure 89)

Formation,  the  general  market  Primary  Trend  (very  important),  and  the
distance that prices can fall before they come to an established Support Zone.
Some of these are topics for later discussion.

Relation of Head-and-Shoulders to Dow Theory

Without  doubt,  some  readers  have  already  suspected  that  the  Head-and-
Shoulders Pattern is, in a sense, just an adaptation of the principles of Dow
Theory  to  the  action  of  an  individual  stock.  So  it  is.  The  decline  of  prices
from the head to the neckline, the rally to the right shoulder, and then the
ensuing  decline  that  breaks  the  neckline  set  up  a  sequence  of  lower  Tops
and Bottoms analogous to those which signal a downtrend in Dow Theory.
This  logical  relation  of  the  Head-and-Shoulders  to  Dow  Theory  is  another
reason,  in  addition  to  its  basic  importance,  frequency,  and  dependability,
why  we  have  placed  it  ﬁrst  in  our  study  of  Reversal  Formations.  But  it  is

The great 1929 Bull Market Top was characterized by many impressive
Head-and-Shoulders Formations, of which this is an interesting example. Note the
small Head-and-Shoulders Pattern of September, which became the head of a much
larger  formation  of  the  same  character.  The  Pullback  of  October  9  to  the  upper
neckline afforded a second chance to get out at 128 to those who did not sell imme-
diately  when  this  ﬁrst  line  was  decisively  penetrated  on  September  28.  The  larger
pattern  “broke”  on  October  19,  with  a  quick  pullback  on  October  22.  Less  than  a
month later “UUK” had lost half its peak value. By 1932 it had fallen to 15
. Although
such a catastrophic decline as 1929–32 may never come again, the moral is, nonethe-
less, plain: Never scorn a Head-and-Shoulders Formation. Patterns such as this merge
into the “multiple” types discussed in Chapter 7. Although this example is selected
from  the  1929  portfolio,  they  were  not  at  all  uncommon  mid-20th  century.  Several
modern examples appear in our later pages.

A  massive  Head-and-Shoulders  in  the  S&P?  It  can  clearly  be  seen
here, even when not pointed out by Richard Russell. It is marked on the chart with
a complex head. If one took the complex head alone the formation might be said to
have fulﬁlled itself with the bear market of 2001-2002. The long term trendline which
was  broken  in  2000  should  have  been  signal  enough  that  the  drunken  binge  was
over. Not to mention numerous Basing Points and/or lower lows. The bull market
(or bear market rally of 2004) presents an interpretation problem. The question is has
this  prolonged  rally  nulliﬁed  the  massive  Head-and-Shoulders?  Such  an  extended
penetration  of  the  neckline  might  imply  that  we  were  reading  too  much  into  the
pattern. And, in 2005, this rally is nose to nose with the huge top resistance made in
1999-2000. the technician is 
 to conclude that it will take years to overcome this
resistance.  But  remember,  as  technicians  we  are  obliged  to  change  our  analysis  as

Important Reversal

Head-and-Shoulders (EN: or Kilroy) Bottoms

A formation of the Head-and-Shoulders type may develop at an important
Reversal  of  Trend  from  down  to  up.  In  that  case,  it  is,  of  course,  called  a

always been disturbed by the undescriptive nature of the term “Head-and-Shoulders
Bottom.”  And  so  he  has  renamed  it  the  “Kilroy  Bottom.”  See  Figure 23.1.
  The
volume pattern is somewhat the same (not turned upside down) as at a Top,
but with some important changes in the latter half of the formation, which
we shall discuss in detail. We can lay down speciﬁcations for it in much the
same words as we used for the Head-and-Shoulders Top. Here they are, with
the portions that differ in principle from the Top printed in italics.

A. A decline, climaxing a more or less extensive downtrend, on which
trading volume increases notably, followed by a Minor Recovery on
which volume runs less than it did during the days of ﬁnal decline
and at the Bottom. This is the “left shoulder.” 

EN9: Or left hand.

B. Another decline that carries prices below the Bottom of the left shoul-
der,  on  which  activity  shows  some  increase  (as  compared  with  the

C. A  third  decline  on  decidedly  less  volume  than  accompanied  the

amount approximately equivalent to 3% of the stock’s market price,

“conﬁrmation” or “breakout.”

After  “rounding  over”  in  October  1943  in  the  last  phase  of  a  long
decline from 41 in 1940, Lockheed made a conspicuous 2-month Head-and-Shoulders
Bottom. Note especially, on the above chart, the volume on the rally in early December
and in the ﬁrst week of January with reference to points B and D on the preceding
pages.  “LK”  dropped  back  to  15  again  in  June  1944,  then  ran  up  quickly  to  23  by
November and ﬁnally reached 45 in January 1946. One advantage of logarithmically
scaled  charts  is  that  they  expand,  and  thus  call  attention  to  important  formations
which develop at low price levels, and which would be obscured on an arithmetic
scale.

The essential difference between Top and Bottom patterns, you can see,
lies in their volume charts. Activity in Head-and-Shoulders Bottom Forma-
tion begins usually to show uptrend characteristics at the start of the head
and always to a detectable degree on the rally from the head. It is even more

tion  of  the  neckline
,  else  the  breakout  is  not  to  be  relied  upon  as  a  decisive
conﬁrmation.

There  is  an  important  basic  principle  of  technics  involved  here  which
merits further discussion. Wall Street has an old saying that expresses it: “It
takes buying to put stocks up, but they can fall of their own weight.” Thus,
we trust, and regard as conclusive, any price break (by a decisive margin)
down  through  the  neckline  of  a  Head-and-Shoulders  Top  even  though  it
occurs on a light turnover, but we do not trust a breakout from a Head-and-
Shoulders  Bottom  unless  it  is  deﬁnitely  attended  by  high  volume. A  low-
volume  breakout  from  a  Bottom  Pattern  may  only  be  premature,  to  be
followed after more “work” around the Bottom levels by a genuine advance,
or it may be a “false” move entirely. It pays generally to wait and see. This
same distinction in volume development applies to some of the other Rever-
sal Patterns we shall take up farther on.

FIGURE 22.
Weekly charts are particularly useful for detecting Major Bottom Rever-
sals, since Bottom Formations characteristically take longer to build than Tops. Dome
Mines made a typical Head-and-Shoulders base, 13 months long, at its Primary Trend
Reversal in 1942. Note volume pattern. (Volume detail, however, is better studied on
daily charts.) Dome’s powerful Head-and-Shoulders Bottom was “high” enough to be
conspicuous on an arithmetic monthly chart. Reached 25 in 1944.

Other differences between Top and Bottom Head-and-Shoulders do not
involve any new principles. It can be said that Bottoms are generally longer
and ﬂatter, i.e., they take more time in relation to depth of pattern in points
than do Tops. This is particularly true when they occur at Reversals in the
Primary Trend. The overall volume at Bottoms tends to be less than at Tops,
and the turns more “rounded.” In the construction of a Head-and-Shoulders
Top the activity that goes into the left shoulder usually exceeds that on any
preceding  rally  in  the  entire  uptrend.  In  a  downtrend,  on  the  other  hand,
there  may  be  Panic  Selling  in  some  of  the  earlier  phases  of  decline,  which
runs  the  volume  chart  up  to  a  mark  higher  than  any  that  is  subsequently
registered in the ﬁnal Bottom Formation. But none of these differences affects
our essential Head-and-Shoulders speciﬁcations.

FIGURE  23.
With  a  strong  movement  toward  lower  interest  rates  evident  since
June, the timing of the low in “FNM” is not surprising. Neither is the massive width
(from March through October) of its evolving pattern, which closely matches that of
the huge, complex Inverse Head-and-Shoulders Bottom in Treasury Bills (December
1984), September 25, 1984. Even the slight timing lag is appropriate.

The measuring implications of the Head-and-Shoulders Bottom are the
same in all respects and are applied in the same way as with Tops. Tendency
to symmetry is again the rule, with variations as to slope of neckline, relative
size  of  shoulders  about  the  same  as  in  Tops.  Reactions  to  the  neckline  fol-
lowing the initial breakout from the Bottom type appear in about the same
frequency  and  proportions  as  do  the  Pullback  Rallies  which  follow  initial
breakdown from the Top type.

Multiple Head-and-Shoulders Patterns

The  Head-and-Shoulders  Formations  we  have  examined  up  to  this  point
have been, despite minor variations, relatively simple and clean-cut, consist-
ing  of  three  well-deﬁned  elements.  We  come  now  to  a  group  of  related
patterns  which  carry  much  the  same  technical  signiﬁcance  but  have  more
elements  and  are  much  less  clearly  deﬁned.  These  are  the  Multiple  Head-
and-Shoulders Tops and Bottoms, also known as Complex Formations. We
need not take much of our space to deﬁne them or lay down speciﬁcations
for them, since they may be described quite sufﬁciently as Head-and-Shoul-
ders Reversals in which either the shoulders or the head, or both, have been
doubled or proliferated into several distinct waves.

FIGURE 23.1.
EN: At the risk of being considered a comic (actually, a satirist), I suggest
that, though the image is comical, the pattern is more descriptive of the incongruously named
“Head-and-Shoulders Bottom” than the present terminology. Left hand equals left shoulder.
Right hand equals right shoulder and nose equals head and neckline equals fence line, or, as
easily,  neckline.  I  am  teaching  all  of  my  students  to  think  and  use  this  term,  which  makes
much  more  sense  than  the  absurd  “upside  down  Head-and-Shoulders  Bottom  standing  on
its head.” One hundred years from now this contribution to the nomenclature will be accepted
as totally descriptive and appropriate and the term “Head-and Shoulders Bottom” will have
disappeared from the lexicon.

Almost  any  combination  is  possible,  of  which  only  a  few  can  be  illus-
trated in the actual chart examples reproduced with this chapter. Formations
of  this  type  appear  with  fair  frequency  at  Primary  Bottoms  and  Tops,  but
more often at Bottoms than at Tops. They appear less frequently at Interme-
diate Reversals.

A common form consists of two left shoulders of approximately equal
size,  a  single  head,  and  then  two  right  shoulders,  again  of  approximately
even size and balancing the two on the left. Another is made up of two heads
with two or more shoulders on either side. Still another, of which you will
usually  ﬁnd  several  good  examples  at  any  Major  Market  Turn,  consists  of
double shoulders on either side of a head which is itself composed of a small
but quite distinguishable Head-and-Shoulders development.

Tendency to Symmetry

We have mentioned the tendency toward symmetry in the simple Head-and-
Shoulders  Formation.  Patterns  of  the  Multiple  or  Complex  type  show  an
even  stronger  urge  toward  symmetry  —  so  strong,  in  fact,  that  it  may  be
counted on in determining trading policy. If there are two shoulders on the
left,  there  are  almost  always  two  on  the  right  of  nearly  the  same  size  and
duration.  (Of  course,  one  does  not  know  that  a  Multiple  is  in  process  of
formation until its right shoulder becomes evident.) Except in volume, the
right-hand half of the pattern is, in the great majority of cases, an approxi-
mate mirror image of the left.

Necklines  on  Multiple  Head-and-Shoulders  Formations  are  not  always
easy to draw, since the reactions between the shoulders and between shoulders

Bottom which ended the bear market (or ﬁrst phase thereof) of 2001-2002. Some 7
months in formation it threw a few knuckle balls and curves and looked right up to
March 2003 as though it were a bear market rally. Once the neckline was taken out
there  was  no  arguing  with  it.  It  was  a  real  bottom.  It  balked  at  the  neckline  for  a
couple  of  months  before  becoming  the  full  bull.  Complex  economic  and  political
realities affected the markets. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which put

and  heads  may  not  stop  at  levels  that  all  fall  on  a  single  line.  Up-sloping
and down-sloping variants seldom appear in this class of patterns; necklines
are almost always very close to the horizontal. Sometimes, it is possible to
estimate by simple inspection where the critical line really lies. More often,
there  are  two  necklines,  an  inner  and  an  outer,  and  no  price  movement  of
consequence  is  to  be  expected  until  the  outer  has  been  penetrated  (which,
of course, is simply another expression of that tendency toward symmetry
referred to above).

Curiously enough, the “power” of a Multiple Head-and-Shoulders Pat-
tern is more apt to be over- than underestimated. One might think, in view
of the length of time and amount of trading entering into its construction,
that it would signal a move (in reverse direction to the trend preceding it)
of greater extent than the simple Head-and-Shoulders. Yet, in its immediate

MCA” enjoyed an excellent advance from 1980–1986. But the going
became  increasingly  difﬁcult  after  the  turn  of  the  year,  when  this  issue  began  to
challenge its 1985 high. Although the Bulls did manage to set a new high water mark
in April, a series of Pullbacks kept this issue well away from any further tests. Indeed,
a large Complex Head-and-Shoulders Top appeared to be unfolding with the Major
Neckline penetrated slightly on the sell-off.

consequences,  at  least,  the  Complex  shows  consistently  less  power.  Mini-
mum measuring rules for the two types of formations are the same and are
applied in the same manner. The difference between the patterns appears in
the price action after the minimum has been reached. The ﬁrst downswing
out  of  a  plain  Head-and-Shoulders  Top,  not  counting  any  early  Pullback
Rally, will frequently carry out the minimum measuring implications of that
pattern  quickly  and  run  well  beyond  it.  From  a  Multiple  Top,  the  ﬁrst
downswing is often more leisurely, and very seldom does it exceed the bare
minimum — a probability well worth remembering when you are dealing
with an Intermediate rather than a Primary Top. Of course, if the Complex
does develop at a turn in the Primary Trend, prices will eventually go much
farther, but even then there is usually a strong recovery (or reaction, in the
case of a Bottom) from the “minimum rule” level.

for simple Head-and-Shoulders Reversals. During the earlier stages of Multiple

An  “ideal”  Multiple  Top  made  by  Budd  in  1946,  with  two  heads.
Observe accompanying volume. Prices often break away from Complex Formations
more  reluctantly  than  from  the  simple  Head-and-Shoulders  type.  The  late  March
rally,  which  went  back  through  the  old  neckline,  was  greater  than  normal  in  that
respect,  but  the  general  market Averages  were  pushing  to  new  highs  at  this  time.
Re-penetration  of  a  neckline  does  not,  of  itself  alone,  cancel  the  implications  of  a
Reversal Formation.

Formation development, the volume chart may show much irregularity with
little recognizable pattern, but in the latter stages, its correspondence with
the Head-and-Shoulders Trend should be plainly seen.

There is something about Multiple Head-and-Shoulders patterns espe-
cially  pleasing  to  technical  chart  followers.  Because  of  their  symmetrical
tendencies, it is fascinating to watch them evolve to completion. Once com-
pleted, however, they may try your patience by their seeming reluctance to
“get going” with a new trend. On that account, it becomes easy at times to
jump  to  the  conclusion  that  they  have  “blown  out,”  i.e.,  produced  a  false
signal.  Actually,  except  in  the  matter  of  extent  of  move  which  we  have
already discussed, they are fully as reliable as the plain Head-and-Shoulders.
False moves are relatively rare with both. And in those extraordinary cases
when  a  Complex  Formation  does  go  wrong,  it  still  stands,  like  the  plain
Head-and-Shoulders, as a warning that the ﬁnal Reversal is near.

Rounding Tops and Bottoms

The Multiple Formations we have just examined are produced by a sort of
extension or proliferation of the ordinary Head-and-Shoulders pattern. Carry
this  process  still  further  and  the  Complexes  merge  into  our  next  class  of
Reversals, known as Rounding Turns.

The  long  Multiple  Head-and-Shoulders  Top  made  by American  Lo-
comotive in 1946 displays very well the sort of volume pattern — irregular, but taking
on  deﬁnitely  Bearish  character  in  its  latter  half  —  that  is  normal  to  this  formation.
The rounded Bear Market Rally of August (compare price and volume trends) was
unable  to  attain  the  old  neckline,  but  was  stopped  at  a  Resistance  (RL)  created  by
earlier Bottom levels (see Chapter 13). G and G mark Breakaway Gaps which were
not “covered” (see Chapter 12).

In  our  ﬁrst  approach  to  the  theory  of  chart  Reversal  Patterns,  we  saw
why it takes time and a considerable volume of trading to swing an estab-
lished  trend  in  prices  from  up  to  down  or  down  to  up.  In  the  Head-and-
Shoulders  type  of  Reversal,  the  trend  surges,  struggles,  attacks  again  and
again before it ﬁnally gives up and retreats. During this struggle, the balance
between  the  forces  of  supply  and  demand  ﬂuctuates,  often  wildly,  until
ﬁnally  the  one  overcomes  the  other.  In  the  Multiple  Formations,  a  similar
process  goes  on  but  rather  less  violently  and,  over  a  period  of  time,  the
progressive change from one force to the other becomes clearly apparent.

The Rounding Turn is a much more simple and logical manifestation of
this  technical  phenomenon.  It  pictures  simply  and  plainly  a  gradual,  pro-
gressive, and fairly symmetrical change in the trend direction, produced by
a gradual shift in the balance of power between buying and selling.

If, for example, the buying has been stronger than the selling for some
time past, we know that the result will have been a general upward trend
in  the  price  of  our  stock,  as  indicated  by  our  pictorial  chart  record  of  its
trading history. So long as the buyers of the stock remain more anxious, more
numerous, more aggressive, more powerful than the sellers, that preceding
upward  trend  will  continue.  Now,  however,  suppose  the  selling  grows  a

From a Head-and-Shoulders Top in February, Digital plunged sharply
lower  into  mid-June,  retracting  roughly  two  thirds  of  the  1983–85  advance.  The
(EN: Or Kilroy)
summer low was the head of a Broad, Complex Head-and-Shoulders 
Bottom.  “DEC”,  however,  had  already  enjoyed  a  high-volume  penetration  of  the
neckline and was, therefore, in a buying position.

little stronger, while the buying either weakens slightly or remains stationary
at its previous strength. This slight change in the technical balance will be
indicated by a slowing up of the previous advance. As the selling increases
in relative power, it will ﬁnally become equal to the buying power, with the
result  that  the  market  level  moves  neither  up  nor  down  but  remains  for  a
time quite stationary (except for Minor and insigniﬁcant ﬂuctuations).

Assume  that  the  new  development  continues  and  the  selling  pressure
grows  until  it  is  ﬁnally  stronger  than  buying  power.  Now  the  balance  is
moving the other way. There are now more sellers than buyers, and the result
will be a gradual decline in the market quotations for the stock. If this change
in the balance of power is fairly steady and continues to its logical conclusion,
we  can  see,  even  without  the  aid  of  a  chart,  that  our  picture  of  the  price
movement  for  that  stock  would  be  one  of  a  long  advancing  trend  slowly
beginning to round off, holding in stationary suspense for a time, and then
commencing a retreat, reversing the previous upward movement into a new
and Accelerating Downward Trend.

After testing its 1980 high in mid-1983, “ADM” turned sharply lower,
retracing roughly 40% of the 1982–83 advance by mid-1984. The summer low, how-
ever,  appeared  to  be  a  Bottom.  Indeed,  if  one  looked  at  the  volume  pattern  from
April to November and correlated it with price activity, it was not difﬁcult to make
a  good  case  for  a  Complex  Head-and-Shoulders  Bottom.  A  neckline  through  the
closes gave us a go signal on a penetration of 20

extended, ﬂat-bottomed form which usually takes many months to complete.
There was a host of such developments during 1942 and 1943 among issues
selling under $10 a share. (It should be noted here that “Saucer” Bottoms of
two or three months’ duration also appear frequently, one right after another,
during
in the charts of low-priced issues 
 an extended up-movement. Their
characteristics  and  denotations  will  be  discussed  later  when  we  come  to
Consolidation

.)

Tops of the Rounding type are very rare among stocks in the lower- and
medium-price ranges, but are found occasionally in the charts of those high-
priced common stocks which command an AA rating among wealthy investors
and do not ordinarily interest the general public. They also appear frequently
in  the  charts  of  high-grade  preferred  stocks  and  quite  naturally,  because  the
demand for their shares reﬂects chieﬂy two factors — supply of funds seeking
conservative  investment  and  interest  rates  —  both  of  which  tend  to  change
very slowly. The speculative appeal which produces wide-swinging price ﬂuc-
tuations  is  absent  in  such  issues.  The  same  line  of  reasoning  explains  why
Rounding  Tops  almost  never  develop  in  lower-priced,  speculative  common
stocks;  Bull  Markets  in  those  are  topped  off  by  excited  public  buying  which
pays little or no heed to long-range investment considerations.

Another variant of the Head-and-Shoulders within a Major Reversal
Formation.  The  smaller  Head-and-Shoulders  pattern  was  easily  overlooked  on  the
daily chart. Moreover, although it was 6 months long, this pattern in itself did not
necessarily imply Primary Reversal. But when it pushed “PJ’s” prices up in October
through the great supply which had been lodged at 12–13 the previous December,
something more than a Secondary Advance could obviously be in prospect. An up-
move of consequence was not ﬁnally signaled, however, until February 1943 when
the  upper  neckline  was  penetrated  and  prices  closed  at  14.  Public  Service  “threw
back” to 12 in November 1943 (to the old neckline exactly), but then advanced steadily
to 30. Study this again when you take up Support and Resistance, Chapter 13. This
chart  reiterates  the  point  that,  whereas  Top  Formations  are  often  completed  in  a
relatively  short  time,  Major  Bottoms  usually  require  many  months,  and  call  for  a
great  deal  of  patience.  Allowing  for  the  greater  time  needed,  however,  most  Top
Patterns have their counterparts in Bottom Formations.

How Rounding Turns Affect Trading Activity

We have not, as yet, mentioned the volume half of the Rounding Turn picture.
It  is  interesting,  as  well  as  meaningful.  In  the  case  of  Rounding  Bottoms,  its
pattern is usually as clean-cut and decisive as the price pattern. The ﬁrst step
in  the  gradual  conquest  of  supply  by  demand,  which  produces  a  Rounding

Still  another  form  that  the  Complex  Reversal  may  take.  This  can  be
described as a Head-and-Shoulders Pattern with two widely separated heads. Study
its  volume  pattern,  noting  breakout  June  20  and  subsequent  Pullback.  Compare  it
with Bethlehem Steel’s Bottom Reversal shown in Chapter 12, Figure 123.

Bottom, appears as a lessening in selling pressure. Volume, which has been
running  high,  gradually  decreases.  Demand  is  still  timid,  but  the  pressure
on it less; so, while prices still decline, the pace is slower and the trend curves
more and more to the horizontal. At the Bottom, with the two forces techni-
cally  in  balance,  relatively  few  transactions  are  recorded.  Then  demand
begins to increase, and as the price curve turns up, trading becomes more
active.  Volume  accelerates  with  the  trend  until  often  it  reaches  a  sort  of
climactic  peak  in  a  few  days  of  almost  “vertical”  price  movement  on  the
chart.

In  such  formations,  the  tips  of  the  volume  lines  at  the  bottom  of  the
chart, when connected, will describe an arc that often roughly parallels the
after
arc formed by the price “Bowl” above. These patterns, when they occur 
an  extensive  decline
,  are  of  outstanding  importance,  for  they  nearly  always
denote  a  change  in  Primary  Trend  and  an  extensive  advance  yet  to  come.
That advance, however, seldom carries in a “skyrocket” effect which com-
pletes the entire Major Move in a few weeks. On the contrary, the uptrend
that follows the completion of the pattern itself is apt to be slow and subject
to frequent interruptions, tiring out the impatient trader, but yielding even-
tually a substantial proﬁt.

Monthly  chart,  on  arithmetic  scale.  American  Safety  Razor’s  1932
Major Bottom was a Head-and-Shoulders, also its 1936 Bull Top. Its 1942 to 1946 Bull
Market started from a Rounding Bottom nearly two and a half years long! Monthly
chart study pays.

Let us repeat that trading volume should ebb to an extreme low at the
Bottom  of  a  Bowl  Pattern  if  its  implications  are  to  be  trusted. After  prices
have passed dead center, however, and begun their ﬁrst gradual climb with
as yet only a slight pickup in activity, something in the nature of a premature
breakout may occur. Without warning, a burst of buying may shoot quota-
tions straight up for a day or two. These incidents are by no means rare, but,
almost  invariably,  prices  will  quickly  drop  back  again  into  their  former
channel, and the gradual rounding movement is resumed. There is no par-
ticular danger for the trader in these premature bursts but, if he is tempted
to  jump  in  on  such  a  sudden  showing  of  strength,  he  should  realize  that
there probably will still be need for patience. A classic example of this type
of  premature  break  appears  in  one  of  our  accompanying  illustrations,
Figure 38.

The Dormant Bottom Variation

Dormant
There is one sort of Major Bottom chart picture that has been called a 
Bottom
, but which relates logically to our Bowl Pattern, being, in effect, an
extreme  development  of  the  “extended,  ﬂat-bottomed  form”  to  which  we
have alluded above. It appears characteristically in “thin” stocks, i.e., those
in  which  the  total  number  of  shares  outstanding  or,  more  particularly,  the
ﬂoating supply of shares is very small. In such issues, a normal day’s turn-
over  may  be  only  two  or  three  hundred  shares  in  an  active  rising  market.
Finally, weeks and sometimes months will pass during which no sales will

ﬂuctuates within a fractional range. The chart appears “ﬂy specked.”

Eventually,  there  may  appear  a  sudden  and  usually  quite  inexplicable
ﬂurry  of  activity.  Several  hundred  shares  appear  on  the  tape  and  prices
advance  sharply.  This  “breakout  of  dormancy”  can  be  a  premature  move,
such as we have noted in connection with typical Rounding Bottoms, to be
followed  by  several  more  weeks  of  inactivity,  or  it  can  be  the  ﬁrst  lift  in  a
sort of step-up process with shorter and shorter intervals between each step,
until ﬁnally a consistent uptrend develops. In any event, it is a signal that
we are dealing with an important Accumulation Pattern.

What  has  happened  to  form  these  Dormant  Bottoms  is  easy  to  guess.
With  relatively  few  shares  outstanding,  and  only  an  occasional  lot  put  up
for  sale  “at  the  market,”  investors  (perhaps  insiders  connected  with  the
company) would succeed only in running the price up out of reach if they
started to bid for the stock. So they simply “hold a basket under it,” as the

saying goes, quickly picking up anything that is offered but never reaching
for  it,  until  eventually  the  tree  is  shaken  clean.  Then  they  may  raise  their
bids a point or so; if that seems to bring out a lot of stock for sale, they go
back to their waiting tactics.

Volume Pattern at Tops

The  volume  pattern  on  Rounding  Tops  is  seldom  as  clearly  deﬁned  as  at
Bottoms.  Indeed,  it  is  apt  to  be  rather  high  and  irregular  throughout  the
entire  rounding-over  movement  in  prices.  Under  close  scrutiny,  one  can
usually  see  some  signs  of  a  change  from  Bullish  to  Bearish  activity  in  the
Minor Fluctuations after the peak has been passed, but the volume warnings
do not become conspicuous in most cases until the downtrend has begun to
accelerate toward the vertical.

We know of no measuring formula which can be applied to Rounding
Turns (except for the minimum qualiﬁcations we mentioned in connection
with  Head-and-Shoulders,  i.e.,  they  cannot  be  counted  upon  to  produce  a
greater move than the preceding price swing in the opposite direction). But
they almost never deceive. Their implications can be roughly estimated from
the  magnitude  of  the  trends  that  led  to  them  and  the  length  of  time  they
take  in  the  rounding-over  process.  The  Rounding  Turns  that  often  appear
on weekly and monthly charts, thus, have major import.

FIGURE 40.
The March 1935 reaction produced many Rounding Bottoms. This one
verges on the dormant type. The gap (G), a Breakaway through a Resistance Level,
was not closed until late 1937. (See Chapter 12.)

This leads us to the general consideration of weekly and monthly chart
patterns.  Thus  far,  we  have  been  speaking  in  detail  of  only  daily  chart
developments, but all of the formations we have taken up appear, as well,
in  the  much  larger  swings  into  which  daily  movements  are  condensed  on
weekly  and  monthly  charts,  and  with  identical  signiﬁcance.  Thus,  volume
record may not be quite so easy to read (climactic activity may occur on one
day of a week and the other days run dull, which would not show at all in
the  week’s  total  ﬁgure)  but  is  less  critical  —  may  almost  be  disregarded.
Head-and-Shoulders Tops are particularly plentiful on monthly charts and
should be accorded due respect. In fact, any clearly deﬁned pattern, which
is  built  to  completion  on  a  weekly  or  monthly  chart,  is  proportionately
signiﬁcant (bearing always in mind that “a Reversal must have something
to reverse”).

Important Reversal 
Patterns — The Triangles

We come next to an entirely different family of technical patterns, the Triangles,
a group that has not been as well represented on the charts of the decade of
the 1940s as it was during the 1920s and 1930s. Their scarcity in that decade
is regrettable because they are an intriguing lot with excellent proﬁt potential.
EN: Demonstrating that charts from the 1920s may be intermixed with charts from
(
the 2000s, compare Figures 269 and 269.1.)
 Before we examine them in detail,
however, a quick review of the basic theory, which gives meaning and value
to technical analysis, may be appropriate. That theory can be resummarized
in the following brief statements.

1. The market value of a security is determined solely by the interaction

of supply and demand.

2. Supply  and  demand  are  governed  at  any  given  moment  by  many
hundreds of factors, some rational and some irrational. Information,
opinions,  moods,  guesses  (shrewd  or  otherwise)  as  to  the  future
combine  with  blind  necessities  in  this  equation.  No  ordinary  man
can  hope  to  grasp  and  weigh  them  all,  but  the  market  does  this
automatically.

3. Disregarding Minor Fluctuations, prices move in trends that persist

for an appreciable length of time.

4. Changes in trend, which represent an important shift in the balance
sooner
between supply and demand, however caused, are detectable 
or later

 in the action of the market itself.

By this time, the fact expressed in the italicized words of the last state-
ment may have begun to raise some misgivings in your mind. The complaint
that the Dow Theory is often “late” has already been discussed. The Reversal
Patterns studied in the two preceding chapters give no certain signal until
after the trend has changed, usually “sooner” as compared with Dow Theory,
but never at the absolute top or bottom price. The man who sells a stock as
soon as, but not until, a Head-and-Shoulders Top has been completed on its
chart may cash in on no more than half of the total decline from its extreme
high to extreme bottom, since by the very terms of our measuring formula,
the  ﬁrst  half  of  the  decline  can  have  taken  place  before  the  Top  Reversal
Formation was ﬁnally conﬁrmed.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Make  up  your  mind  that  there  is  no  help  for  it.  Somebody,  of  course,
managed to sell his shares at the very top eighth of a point on the peak of
the  “head”  (and  some  poor  devil  bought  them).  The  seller  was  just  plain
lucky! His exploit can be truly compared with a “hole-in-one” in golf. Even
a complete duffer occasionally enjoys that thrill. But the more experienced
a player, the better satisﬁed he is to land safely on the green and not too far
from  the  cup.  The  more  experienced  an  investor,  the  less  concerned  he  is
with  getting  the  last  point,  or  even  the  last  ten  points,  out  of  his  market
commitments.

at  the  time

No  one  can  ever  be  sure 

  that  he  is  selling  at  the  ﬁnal  high.
No rules or methods have ever been devised — or ever will be — to ensure
buying within fractions of the Bottom, or selling within fractions of the Top.
Of  course,  a  man  can  make  certain  of  buying  a  stock  at  its  absolute  low
provided he is prepared to take at that ﬁgure every last share offered, even
to  the  entire  outstanding  issue  if  necessary.  It  might,  in  theory,  require  as
(EN9: ca. 1950s)
much as $3.7 billion to “put a bottom” under U.S. Steel at 70, 
in case you are tempted.

The reader, who at this point may think we “protest too much,” will see
more  excuses  for  the  foregoing  remarks  when  we  take  up  the  habits  of
Triangles, for these formations are not always indicative of Trend Reversal.
On the contrary, except in certain rather uncommon varieties, they are more
apt  to  signal  what  may  most  conveniently  be  termed 
,  termi-
nating  an  up  or  down  move  only  temporarily  and  setting  the  stage  for
another  strong  move 
  later  on.  (Schabacker  called  such
chart formations “Continuation Patterns.”) The reason for including Trian-
gles  in  this  section  of  our  studies  under  the  general  heading  of  Reversal
Formations  is  that  they  do,  at  times,  develop  at  periods  of  Major  Trend
change, and those are, by all odds, the periods which it is most essential for
the investor to recognize.

Consolidation

Symmetrical Triangles

smaller than its predecessor

The most common form of a Triangle is composed of a series of price ﬂuc-
, each Minor Top failing
tuations, each of which is 
to attain the height of the preceding rally, and each Minor Recession stopping
above the level of the preceding Bottom. The result is a sort of contracting
“Dow Line” on the chart — a sideways price area or trading range whose
 boundary line
Top can be more or less accurately deﬁned by a 
and whose Bottom can be similarly bounded by an 
 line. This type
of Triangle is called a Symmetrical Triangle. If we wanted to make a more
accurate application of the language of geometry, we might better call it an
Acute Triangle, since it is not at all necessary that its Top and Bottom bound-
aries  be  of  equal  length  or,  in  other  words,  make  the  same  angle  with  the
horizontal axis. However, there is a very strong tendency in these formations
to approximate the symmetrical form; so, the established name will do well
enough. This pattern is also sometimes referred to as a “Coil.”

While  the  process  of  contraction  or  coiling,  which  makes  up  the  price
action  of  the  Symmetrical  Triangle  Pattern,  is  going  on,  trading  activity
exhibits  a  diminishing  trend,  irregularly  perhaps,  but  nevertheless  quite
noticeably as time goes on. The converging upper and lower boundary lines
of the price formation come together somewhere out to the right (the future
in the time sense) of the chart, at the apex of our Triangle. As prices work
their  way  along  in  narrower  and  narrower  ﬂuctuations  toward  the  apex,
volume ebbs to an abnormally low daily turnover. Then, if we are dealing
with  a  typical  example,  comes  the  action  which  ﬁrst  suggested  the  name
“Coil.” For suddenly and without warning, as though a coil spring had been
wound tighter and tighter and then snapped free, prices break out of their
Triangle with a notable pickup in volume, and leap away in a strong move
which tends to approximate in extent the up or down move that preceded
its formation.

There is seldom any clue given on the one chart containing the Triangle
to tell in which direction prices are going to break out of the pattern until
that action ﬁnally occurs. Sometimes you can get a pretty good idea of what
is  likely  to  happen  by  observing  what  is  going  on  at  the  same  time  in  the
charts of other stocks (which is an important topic for later discussion), but

often,  there  is  nothing  to  do  but  wait  until  the  market  makes  up  its  mind
which way to go. And “making up its mind” is just what the market seems
to be doing when it builds a Triangle; everything about this pattern appears
to exemplify doubt, vacillation, and stalling until ﬁnally a decision is reached.

Some Cautions About Symmetrical Triangles

A  compact,  clean-cut  Triangle  is  a  fascinating  picture,  but  it  has  its  tricky
features. The beginner in technical chart analysis is quite naturally prone to
look for Triangles constantly, and will often think he has detected them when,
in fact, something entirely different is in the process of development. Remem-
ber that it takes two points to determine a line. The top boundary line of a
price area cannot be drawn until two Minor Trend Tops have been deﬁnitely
established, which means that prices must have moved up to and then down
away from both far enough to leave the two peaks standing out clear and
clean  on  the  chart. A  bottom  boundary  line,  by  the  same  token,  cannot  be
drawn  until  two  Minor  Trend  Bottoms  have  been  deﬁnitely  established.
Therefore, before you can conclude that a Symmetrical Triangle is building,
you must be able to see 
Reversals of Minor Trend. If it comes after an
advance in prices, you must have ﬁrst a Top, next a Bottom, next a second
Top  lower  than  the  ﬁrst,  and  ﬁnally  a  second  Bottom  higher  than  the  ﬁrst
Bottom (and prices must move up away from the second Bottom before you
can be sure it is a Bottom). Then, and only then, can you draw your boundary
lines and proceed on the assumption that you have a Symmetrical Triangle.

Chapter eight:

Important Reversal Patterns — The Triangles

103

Another point to remember — and one which does not conform at all
to  the  “coil”  simile  —  is  that  the  farther  out  into  the  apex  of  the  Triangle
prices  push  without  bursting  its  boundaries,  the  less  force  or  power  the
pattern  seems  to  have.  Instead  of  building  up  more  pressure,  it  begins  to
lose its efﬁcacy after a certain stage. The best moves (up or down) seem to
ensue when prices break out decisively at a point somewhere between half
and three quarters of the horizontal distance from the base (left-hand end)
to the apex. If prices continue to move “sideways” in narrower and narrower
ﬂuctuations from day to day after the three quarter mark is passed, they are
quite apt to keep right on to the apex and beyond in a dull drift or ripple
which leaves the chart analyst completely at sea. The best thing to do in such
cases is go away and look for something more promising elsewhere in your
chart book.

And a third tricky point is that it becomes necessary sometimes to redraw
one or both boundaries of a Triangle before it is ﬁnally completed (i.e., before
prices  break  out  and  move  away  from  it  in  a  decisive  fashion).  This  can
happen, for example, when, after the ﬁrst two Rally Tops have established
a down-slanting upper boundary line, the third rally starting from the lower
 the original Top line by a moderate margin
boundary pushes up and 
and then, without developing a recognizable breakout volume on this move,
stops short of surpassing the highest level of the preceding (second) pattern
Top. When prices subsequently drop back again into pattern, it is necessary
to abandon the original upper boundary line and draw a new one across the
highs of the ﬁrst and third rally tops.

How Prices Break Out of a Symmetrical Triangle

Prices may move out of a Symmetrical Triangle either up or down. There is
seldom,  if  ever,  as  we  have  said  above,  any  clue  as  to  direction  until  the
move has actually started, i.e., until prices have broken out of their triangular
“area of doubt” in decisive fashion. In a very general way, the precepts we
have laid down for breakouts from Head-and-Shoulders Formations apply
here as well. For example, the margin by which prices should close beyond
upside
the pattern lines is the same, roughly 3%. It is equally essential that an 
break in prices be conﬁrmed by a marked increase in trading volume; lacking
volume, do not trust the price achievement. But a 
 breakout, again
as in the case of the Head-and-Shoulders, does not require conﬁrmation by
a pickup in activity. As a matter of record, volume does visibly increase in
most cases, but in a majority of down breaks, not to any notable extent until
after prices have fallen below the level of the last preceding Minor Bottom
within the Triangle, which, as you can see, may be several points lower than
the boundary line at the place (date) of the actual breakout.

downside

The curious fact is that a downside breakout from a Symmetrical Triangle
which is attended right from the start by conspicuously heavy volume is much
more apt to be a false signal rather than the start of a genuine downtrend that

Johns-Manville’s Primary Trend Reversal in 1942 developed out of a

will  be  worth  following.  This  is  particularly  true  if  the  break  occurs  after
prices have worked their way well out into the apex of the Triangle; a high
volume crack then frequently — we might even say usually — develops into
a 2- or 3-day “shakeout” which quickly reverses itself and is followed by a
genuine move in the 

 direction.

All of the above the reader will have undoubtedly found most discon-
certing.  Here  is  a  very  pretty  technical  pattern  and  it  cannot  always  be
 moves to a
trusted. Unfortunately, Symmetrical Triangles are subject to 
far greater extent than the Head-and-Shoulders or any of the other forma-
tions we have discussed or will discuss later. Unfortunately, some of these
false moves cannot be identiﬁed as such until after a commitment has been
risked (although good trading tactics should prevent their occasioning much
more than a trivial loss). And, unfortunately again, even a typical shakeout,
such  as  we  described  in  the  preceding  paragraph,  may  produce  a  double
cross,  proceeding  right  on  down  in  a  genuine  decline.  No  technical  chart
formation  is  100%  reliable,  and,  of  all,  our  present  subject  is  the  worst
offender.

themselves properly, produce no false signals which cannot be spotted before

in  the  sense  that  prices  return  to  pattern  and  do  some  more  “work”  there
before the genuine uptrend gets under way, but they seldom are false. We
shall have a little more to say about false signals in this chapter and more

moving up. (Let’s hope you bought it at 20!) Lower down, its turnover ran
between 300 and 600 shares daily, but now, above 30, it has attracted quite
a following, and daily volume has increased to around 1000. As it approaches
40,  activity  shoots  up  to  nearly  2000  shares,  the  market  “churns”  between
39 and 40, and then prices begin to drop. As they fall back, you (especially
if you own the stock) watch it with some concern, but you know it is hardly
likely that it is going to go straight down again to 20; stocks don’t act that
way. 
If the trend of this issue
has actually been reversed, it should, nevertheless, spend some more time
and effort around its top levels, make some sort of a Distribution Pattern.

(EN9: Sometimes they do now, in the 21st century.) 

The decline continues for 10 days with the turnover also declining quite
appreciably. By the time prices have worked back to 33, volume is running
at  about  700  shares  daily.  At  33,  it  may  pick  up  again  for  a  single  day  to
800 or 900 shares, but the reaction stops there, and after a day or two, prices
begin to climb again with little change in their turnover rate. In 8 or 9 days,
quotations  have  gotten  back  into  the  upper  30s  and  activity  increases  and
reaches,  say,  1200  shares  on  the  day  39  is  reached.  Instead  of  going  on  to

its development on a scrap of chart paper.) Now it is evident that a second
Top has formed at 39; you can now draw a tentative pattern line (there are
other  names  for  this,  as  we  shall  see  later)  on  your  chart  across  the  two

FIGURE 50.
Recovery rallies from “Panic” Bottoms are often capped by Triangles,
for those are periods in which doubt and indecision are prevalent. The doubt in such
cases,  however,  is  usually  resolved  in  favor  of  renewed  decline.  “Panic”  Bottoms
seldom hold. This chart shows a typical Symmetrical Pattern topping the recovery
from the famous Selling Climax of October 19, 1937. Note Pullback to apex.

duration).  But  the  volume  on  this  Minor  Penetration  is  less  than  on  the
preceding Top (at 39), and buying again ebbs. As the price range line falls
back to 37 and 36, you had best now draw a new upper tangent across the
½
ﬁrst Top at 40 and the last Top at 38
. There is the suggestion here in this
slight “lift” that the balance may be swinging slightly to the demand side,
but don’t count on it. Pinpoint accuracy is not to be expected; Triangles must
be allowed some leeway.

On  the  third  reaction,  activity  dwindles  away  to  the  lowest  yet.  The
up-slanting Bottom boundary will be reached at about the 35 level if prices
continue  their  present  course.  It  is  worth  noting  now  if  they  will  come  all
the  way  down  to  it  this  time,  because  if  they  don’t  —  if  their  recession  is
halted half a point or so above it — that action would give some signiﬁcance
to the previous bulge through the upper boundary. But this doesn’t happen;
the drift continues right on down to 35, and now volume is running at the
rate of only 200 shares daily, less than it ran in the early stages of the original
advance above 20. This is a critical spot. The price track ﬂattens out momen-

A Major Symmetrical Triangle Top in which prices squeezed out into

breakout;  the  doubt  is  resolved  and  (barring  a  false  move,  unlikely  at  this
point) the trend is once again up. Note that it was not necessary for prices
to  surpass  the  previous  high  at  40  to  produce  this  signal  —  that  is  one  of
the interesting things about Symmetrical Triangles.

Reversal or Consolidation

But, we started to discuss Symmetrical Triangles as Reversal Patterns, and
our example has turned out to be, instead, a 
 Pattern, i.e., only
a sort of resting stage in a continued uptrend. Well, three out of four of these
formations will turn out to be just that. The fourth is the dangerous one (if
you own the stock). How would it differ?

Consolidation

The example described might have been a Reversal instead of a Consol-
idation Formation any time up to the point of the decisive breakthrough to
39. If it had been a typical Reversal, the ﬁrst change would probably have
appeared shortly after the ﬁnal rally started up from the third Bottom at 35.
That  rally  would  have  petered  out  at  about  36
,  and  prices  would  have
started  to  drift  back  again.  Then,  with  the  activity  increasing  slightly,  the
Bottom boundary would be penetrated. As quotations dropped to 34, daily

FIGURE 53.
A weekly chart. The 7-month Consolidation area of 1944 — in “NG,”
undeﬁnable at ﬁrst, developed eventually into a typical Symmetrical Triangle. Two
months after the high-volume breakout in January 1945, prices reacted nearly to apex
level, then pushed away rapidly. Minimum measuring implications of this Triangle
were satisﬁed at 16.

volume might mount to 600 or 700 shares. Any further decline would con-
stitute a down signal and would result in a further pickup in turnover and
an acceleration in the price decline as the stop-loss orders (to be discussed
later) spotted under 34 were “touched off.”

Before we leave our typical example, we might make some mention of
the post-breakout reactions or Pullbacks that sometimes occur. As in the case
of  the  Head-and-Shoulders  Formation,  the  initial  breakout  move  from  a
Symmetrical Triangle may halt before prices are carried very far away from
the pattern and be followed by a Minor Reaction, usually lasting only 2 or
3  days,  which  will  carry  quotations  back  to  the  nearest  pattern  boundary.
Thus, in our ﬁrst example in which the break, when it came, took our stock
up through the top side to 39
, the next day might have seen a push on to
40,  and  then  prices  might  have  backed  off  again  in  a  couple  of  days  of
decreased  activity  to  37
or  38.  The  up-move  would  then  normally  be

resumed with greater vigor. Downside breakouts are sometimes followed in
much the same manner by pullbacks to the lower boundary of the pattern,
after  which  the  decline  is  resumed  with  an  increase  in  volume.  However,
these  post-breakout  reactions  occur  less  often  with  Triangles  than  they  do
with Head-and-Shoulders patterns.

rationale

Another  matter  we  might  take  up,  before  going  on  to  study  the  next
formation, is the 
 of the Symmetrical Triangle. It may help to ﬁx its
characteristics in mind if we try to deduce what sequence of events might
typically  produce  it.  Of  course,  any  effort  of  this  sort  can  result  only  in  a
gross oversimpliﬁcation which will not ﬁt all of the Triangle’s various man-
ifestations, but it is an interesting mental speculation — and one not without
beneﬁt to our understanding of the general theory of chart formations. Let
us turn back again to our typical example. We started with a stock that ran
up rather steadily from around 20 to 40 and then reacted. It is fairly obvious
what  happened  at  40:  many  investors  had  substantial  paper  proﬁts,
approaching 100%, at that price. (A “round ﬁgure” such as 40, 50, 75, or 100
is  apt  to  become  a  sort  of  mental  proﬁt  objective  and,  hence,  bring  in
increased selling.) Some of them were ready to cash in and did so, tempo-
rarily swinging the technical balance from demand to supply; they sold less
freely,  of  course,  as  prices  receded.  Other  would-be  investors  had  been
attracted  to  the  stock,  but  too  late  to  “get  aboard”  below  30.  Unwilling  to
“chase” it up to 40, they welcomed the reaction and, by the time prices had
dropped  back  to  33,  enough  of  them  were  now  ready  to  buy  to  swing  the
balance back again to the demand side of the equation.

Watching the ensuing rally, however, were the owners of the stock who
had  failed  to  grab  their  proﬁts  near  40  on  the  previous  advance  and  had
made up their minds to be a little less greedy if given a second opportunity.

FIGURE 55.
An Ascending Triangle 10 months long which was the start of a Major
Bull  Trend,  carrying  “ABN”  to  45.  Refusal  of  prices  to  react  to  the  lower  pattern
boundary, as here in August 1942, is a frequent development in strong formations,
a warning of near completion and breakout.

Their offerings began to come in above 37, say, and were sufﬁciently copious
at 39 to stem the advance at that level. Behind the scenes, we can imagine
this process repeated again and again, with new money constantly coming
in  and  meeting  supply  from  owners  increasingly  anxious  to  cinch  their
proﬁts.  Eventually,  the  offerings  of  the  latter  are  all  absorbed,  or  perhaps
withdrawn, and then professionals, as well as hopeful investors, suddenly
discover that there is no stock ahead on the books and rush to buy results.
Since the advance (or decline) that follows the completion of a Symmet-
rical Triangle usually runs to worthwhile trading proportions (we shall dis-
cuss measuring implications later), there would be evident advantage to the
trader  who  could  tell  in  advance  of  the  breakout  which  way  prices  were

going to move. The odds are, as we have already said, that the new move
will proceed in the same direction as the one prior to the Triangle’s formation.
These odds are greatest, of course, in the 
 stages of either a Primary Bull
or Bear Market, with the chances of Reversal increasing as those Major Trends
mature. But the charts of other stocks often furnish valuable collateral evi-
dence. Thus, if at the same time you detect a Symmetrical Triangle in process
of  formation  in  “PDQ,”  a  majority  of  your  charts  are  showing  Saucers  or
Head-and-Shoulders Bottoms or Ascending Triangles or some other pattern
of  typically  Bullish  import,  it  is  a  fair  assumption  that  your  Symmetrical
Triangle will break out topside. There are times when advance indications
of this sort are strong enough to justify taking a position on it.

The Right-Angle Triangles

Ascending

We mentioned 
 Triangles in the preceding paragraph. The Ascend-
ing and Descending are the Bullish and Bearish manifestations, respectively,
. In many respects, in
of our next class of patterns, the 
most in fact, they perform like their Symmetrical cousins, but with this very
gratifying  difference:  they  give  advance  notice  of  their  intentions.  Hence,
their names, for the supposition always is that prices will ascend out of the
Ascending form and descend from the Descending form.

Right-Angle Triangles

The Symmetrical Triangles, as we have seen, are constructed of a series
of  successively  narrower  price  ﬂuctuations  which  can  be  approximately
bounded across their Tops by a down-sloping line and across their Bottoms
by  an  up-sloping  line.  Right-Angle  Triangles  are  distinguished  by  the  fact

A  steep  recovery  from  a  Panic  Bottom  (the  “Pearl  Harbor”  selling)
ﬂattened out into a ﬁne Ascending Triangle. Note horizontal supply line at 19, above
a  gradually  rising  demand  line.  The  breakout  at  the  end  of  September  signaled
initiation  of  an  advance  of  some  consequence.  It  turned  out  to  be  a  Primary  Bull
Market which took Briggs up to 53.

that one of their boundaries is practically horizontal, while the other slants
toward it. If the top line is horizontal and the bottom line slopes up to meet
it somewhere out to the right of the chart (at the apex), the Triangle is of the
Ascending
 persuasion. If the bottom line is horizontal and the top line slopes
down, the Triangle is 

Descending
.

These formations are perfectly logical and easy to explain. The Ascend-
ing  Triangle,  for  instance,  pictures  in  the  simplest  and  most  normal  form
what  happens  when  a  growing  demand  for  a  certain  stock  meets  a  large
block of shares for sale at a ﬁxed price. If the demand continues, the supply
being distributed at that price will eventually be entirely absorbed by new
owners looking for still higher levels, and prices will then advance rapidly.
A typical Ascending Pattern starts to develop in much the same way as the
“ideal” Symmetrical Triangle previously described, with an advance in our
certain stock from 20 to 40 where sufﬁcient supply suddenly appears on the
market  to  ﬁll  the  orders  of  all  buyers  and  produce  a  reaction.  Sensing  the
temporary satiation of demand, some owners may dump their holdings on
the decline, but offerings are soon exhausted as prices drop back to, say, 34,
and  renewed  demand  then  stimulates  a  new  rally.  This  runs  into  supply

Sears’ 1936 Bull Market Top was a Symmetrical Triangle, out of which
it declined 15 points. An Ascending Triangle then produced an Intermediate Recovery
to the Supply Zone (see Chapter 13) at the lower side of the top Triangle. Compare
this chart with the 1946 Top in Figure 45.

again at 40, and again, all buyers are accommodated at that level. The second
recession,  however,  carries  quotation  down  only  to  36  before  another
up-move  develops.  But  the  pool  or  inside  group  that  is  distributing  at  40
still has some of its holdings left to sell, so it may take more time, another
backing  away  and  another  attack  at  the  40  line,  before  the  supply  there  is
exhausted and the trend can push along up.

A Planned Distribution

This  type  of  market  action  evidences  a  planned  campaign  by  owners  of  a
fairly large quantity of shares to liquidate at a predetermined price. It con-
tains little of the element of doubt that we mentioned as characterizing the
Symmetrical  Pattern.  So  long  as  demand  persists,  the  distributing  pool
knows it can ultimately cash in its entire line at 40 and need not sell for less.
It  is  equally  apparent,  so  long  as  demand  keeps  coming  in  at  higher  and
higher levels, that, once the supply at 40 has all been absorbed, the market
will advance rapidly and easily. As soon as prices break out above 40, those
who  took  over  the  supply  at  that  ﬁgure  will  feel  their  judgment  has  been
vindicated and will not be disposed to sell until they, in turn, can register a
good proﬁt.

The  crux  of  the  matter  is,  of  course,  contained  in  the  two  preceding
sentences.  Demand  must  continue  to  come  in  at  higher  and  higher  levels;

An  Ascending  Triangle  at  an  Intermediate  Bottom.  This  chart  runs
from April through August 1936. Extreme shrinkage in trading volume during this
formation indicated a very strong situation technically.

otherwise,  our  formation  will  cease  to  be  an Ascending  Triangle. And  the
overhead supply must eventually be absorbed, permitting an upside break-
out. If demand begins to falter any time before the Supply Line (horizontal
Top  boundary)  has  been  broken  through,  the  ensuing  reaction  may  drop
prices down “out of pattern,” and then the chart technician is faced with the
necessity of revising his chart picture. One might think that such a develop-
ment, blasting the earlier promise of the chart, would occur fairly often, but,
as  a  matter  of  experience,  it  is  surprisingly  rare.  We  say  “surprisingly”
because it is obvious that in many cases of Ascending Triangle development,
the  group  whose  selling  creates  its  Top  boundary  or  Supply  Line  must
believe that level to be just about as high as the stock has any right to go.
As holders of a large enough block to inﬂuence the market for several weeks,

Important Reversal Patterns — The Triangles

and sometimes for months, their judgment is hardly to be scorned. Yet, once
up
it becomes evident that the lower boundary or Demand Line is slanting 
,
the odds are certainly somewhere in the neighborhood of 9–1 that the new
buyers will eventually have the best of it.

On occasion, the third reaction or fourth reaction within an Ascending
Triangle  Formation  will  break  down  through  the  previously  established
up-slanting Demand Line (lower boundary), but will be halted at the same
level as the previous reaction. The pattern from there on is apt to develop
, a formation to be discussed in our next chapter, and should
as a 
be  treated  as  such.  (The 
  of  trading  on  Ascending  and  Descending
Triangles, including protection against the rare cases of collapse, will be taken
up in the second section of this book.)

group) 

Descending  Triangles  have  a  horizontal  lower  boundary  or  Demand  Line
and a down-sloping upper boundary or Supply Line. It is evident that they
are created by market conditions just the reverse of those responsible for the
Ascending Pattern. Their implications are equally strong and their failures
equally rare. Development of a Descending Formation hinges upon a cam-
(EN9:  or  Mutual
paign  by  a  group  or  syndicate  (often  an  investment  trust) 
Fund  or  a  takeover
to  acquire  a  large  block  of  shares  in  a  certain
company at a predetermined price below the market. Their orders are placed
and  allowed  to  stand  until  executed  at  that  level.  If  the  successive  rallies
therefrom, which their buying generates, are stiﬂed by new supplies of stock
for  sale  at  lower  and  lower  levels  (thus  creating  the  typical  Descending
picture on the chart), orders to buy are eventually all ﬁlled and quotations
break  through  and  on  down.  The  mere  breaking  of  the  critical  line,  which
many traders have seen function as a support under the market for a more
or less extended period, often shakes the conﬁdence of holders who had not
previously considered selling. Their offerings now come on the market and
accelerate the decline.

Volume Characteristics Same as Symmetrical Type

The volume section of the Right-Angle Triangle’s chart requires little com-
ment.  It  will  ordinarily  present  a  picture  practically  identical  with  that
accompanying the development of a Symmetrical Triangle. Activity tends to
lessen  as  prices  move  out  toward  the  apex.  In  the  Ascending  Formation,
there will usually be a pickup on each rally and an ebb in turnover on each
decline within the pattern; in the Descending Formation, the opposite is true,
but sometimes not quite so evident. These Minor ﬂuctuations, however, do
not affect the overall diminishing trend of volume until the breakout point
is reached.

FIGURE  61.
The  1942  Bear  Market  Bottom  in  Socony–Vacuum  was  an  unusual
Head-and-Shoulders formation, the head consisting of an Ascending Triangle. Note
increase in volume on the breakout from the Triangle in July and again on the break
through the Head-and-Shoulders neckline in October.

As to breakouts also, practically everything we have said about the Sym-
metrical Triangle will apply as well to the Right-Angle type. Upside breakouts
(from an Ascending Pattern, of course) are attended by a conspicuous increase
in trading volume; if not, they should be treated as suspect. Downside break-
outs (from Descending Patterns) may not evince much of a pickup in activity,
but turnover usually speeds up the second or third day out of pattern. Throw-
back reactions to the pattern’s boundary line after a breakout are fairly common;
their occurrence seems to depend largely on general market conditions. Thus,
if prices break down out of a Descending Triangle in an individual stock at a
time when the rest of the market is ﬁrm, a Pullback Rally is fairly certain to
intervene before any very extensive further decline takes place.

Good,  reliable  breakouts  from  Right-Angle  Triangles  usually  occur  at
about the same stage of pattern completion as they do in Symmetrical Tri-
angles. The earlier the breakout, the less apt it is to be a false move (although
false moves from Right-Angle Formations are considerably rarer, it should
be  noted,  than  from  Symmetrical).  In  those  infrequent  cases  when  prices

Because a dividend of $1.00 went ex on March 14, the lower boundary
of  this  Descending  Triangle  Top  in  “BIW”  had  to  be  dropped  1  point  from  33  and
redrawn at 32. Despite the added leeway thus afforded, however, the original pattern
implications were quickly carried out. Prices pulled back three times to the new lower
boundary  line  of  this  Triangle  on  April  4,  April  16,  and  May  31  —  unusual,  but
explained  by  the  existence  of  a  strong  general  market  uptrend  during  this  period.
Whenever a stock goes ex-dividend during the formation of an Area Pattern of any
type,  the  lines  bounding  that  pattern  should  immediately  be  adjusted  to  the  new
value by lowering them a distance corresponding to the amount of the dividend.

“squeeze” right on out of the apex without producing a deﬁnite breakout,
the pattern seems to lose much of its power.

Measuring Implications of Triangles

We  have  stated  (in  Chapter 6)  a  minimum  measuring  rule  to  apply  to  price
movements  developing  from  a  Head-and-Shoulders  Formation,  and  we  can
lay down a somewhat similar rule for Triangles — one that applies to both the
Symmetrical and the Right Angle species. The method of deriving the Triangle
formula is not easy to explain in words, but the reader can familiarize himself
with it quickly by studying its application on several of the actual examples
which illustrate this chapter. Assuming that we are dealing with an up-move-
ment (upside breakout), draw from the Top of the ﬁrst rally that initiated the

On the basis of “fundamentals,” Revere was an attractive holding in
1946, which may account for its reluctance to “give up” when the market generally
started downhill in earnest in June of that year. Its ﬂuctuations from mid-May to late
August  constructed  a  ﬁne,  large  Descending  Triangle,  in  which,  however,  Bearish
Volume Signals had already appeared in late June and on July 23. The breakout came
(with a wide Breakaway Gap) on August 27. Prices clung to the edge of the pattern
for 4 days, then collapsed. The small formations outlined in April and May are Flags,
to be discussed in Chapter 11.

Bottom boundary. This line will slope up away from the pattern to the right.
Prices may be expected to climb until they reach this line. Also, as a rule, they
will climb, following their breakout from the pattern, at about the same angle
or  rate  as  characterized  their  trend  prior  to  their  entering  the  pattern.  This
principle  permits  us  to  arrive  at  an  approximate  time  and  level  for  them  to
attain  the  measuring  line.  The  same  rules  apply  (but  measuring  down,  of
course, from the lower left corner) to a descending move.

Although  application  of  the  above  formula  does  afford  a  fair  estimate
of the extent of move to be expected from a Triangle, it is neither as deﬁnite
nor as reliable as the Head-and-Shoulders formula. Do not forget the impor-
tant qualiﬁcation that the Triangle has somehow lost a part of its potential
strength if the breakout is delayed until prices are crowded into the apex.

FIGURE 64.
The 1937 Bull Market Top in Westinghouse was this Descending Trian-
gle  which  started  in  January  and  broke  on  February  15.  Prices  hung  at  the  lower
edge of the Triangle for 4 days, fell away, and then pulled back to its lower line on
March 4 at the time when the general market Averages were making their ﬁnal Bull
highs.

This chart, and a number that have preceded it, illustrate an important point for
the  market  technician  which  may  well  be  restated  here:  When  a  large  number  of
individual  issues,  after  an  extensive  advance,  make  well-deﬁned  Reversal  Patterns
of plainly Bearish import, break down out of them, and then succeed only in pulling
back  no  farther  than  their  lower  boundaries  or  “Resistance  Lines”  at  a  time  when
the  Averages  are  going  on  up  to  new  highs,  the  whole  market  is  in  a  dangerous
condition,  and  a  Major  Downturn  is  imminent.  Divergences  of  this  particular  sort
between  many  important  issues  and  the Averages  seldom  develop  at  Intermediate
Turns.  The  warning  is  particularly  pointed  when  stocks  of  the  caliber  of  Westing-
house, DuPont, General Motors, etc., fail to “conﬁrm” new highs in the Averages.

Refer back to Figures 12, 15, 18, and 58, for example, and compare the “timing” in
those with the trend of the Averages for the same periods. The Saucer-like Reaction
Pattern  of  October  to  January  in  the  above  chart  analyzes  into  a  Complex
Head-and-Shoulders  Consolidation,  a  formation  which  will  be  taken  up  in
Chapter 11.

Incidentally, “WX” continued on down to 130 in April 1937, made a Rectangle base
there, and recovered to 158 (cf. above Descending Triangle) in August, and then fell
to  88  in  November.  Compare  this  daily  chart  with  the  monthly  chart  of  “WX”  for
1935 to 1938 in Chapter 15.

FIGURE 66.
The curious, and in its early stages confusing, Major Bottom Formation
which American Rolling Mills constructed in 1941–43. The recovery from the “Pearl
Harbor Panic” of 1941 ran into a large Symmetrical Triangle which broke out on the
downside in April 1942. The subsequent decline satisﬁed the measuring requirements
of  that  Triangle,  but  did  not  carry  below  the  December  low.  The  rally  of  June  and
reaction  of  August–September  built  the  whole  area  out  into  another  and  larger
Symmetrical Triangle, out of which prices broke on the upside in September. Then
the reaction to the apex of the latter, in December 1942, and the following advance
built up into a 15-month Ascending Triangle which constituted the ﬁnal Major Bottom
for  a  trend  that  carried  prices  up  eventually  to  42  in  1946.  The  low  volume  on  the
June and August–September reactions, the increase on the October markup and, even
more, the January 1943 rise and breakout in February were unmistakably of Major
Bullish implications. It takes time, remember, to build a foundation for a Bull Market.

Triangles on Weekly and Monthly Charts

We  have  seen  in  preceding  studies  how  Head-and-Shoulders  Formations
may  appear  on  the  long-range  (weekly  or  monthly)  charts  and  will  have
importance commensurate with their size. Triangles also may develop. On
weekly charts, their implications are usually clear and dependable, but the
coarse Triangular Patterns which can be found on graphs of monthly price
ranges, especially the great, loose convergences that take years to complete,
had better be dismissed as without useful signiﬁcance.

A beautifully compact Ascending Triangle which turned out to be the
Major Bear-to-Bull Reversal in Goodrich in 1942. The breakout from this pattern (in
April) was not signaled by any extraordinary pickup in activity so far as this weekly
record shows (but remember that signiﬁcant volume detail is often hard to see in a
weekly plotting). The Triangle’s measuring implications were carried out by the ﬁrst
upswing which reached 18
at the end of May. Supply had to be absorbed in the 18
to  21  range  (refer  back  to  this  chart  when  you  study  Support  and  Resistance  in
Chapter 13),  but  a  Major  Up  Signal  was  given  in  September  when  prices  erupted
through that zone with a conspicuous increase in trading volume.

Other Triangular Formations

There  are  other  patterns  of  price  consolidation  or  congestion  that  can  be
bounded by converging lines and might, therefore, be classiﬁed as Triangles.

A  real  time  chart  from  prophet.net.  The  volume  blow  out  in  July
2002 drew attention to Ebay and the sloping line was drawn at that time. Although
the lines are sloppy and the pattern is ragged it looked at the time like a Descending
Triangle with all its implications. But when it broke out of the pattern on emphatic
volume  in  October  2003  the  handwriting  was  on  the  wall.  Ebay  was  for  real.  So,
what’s  for  real?  It  could  really  make  money,  not  just  capture  free  eyeballs,  like  its
Internet brothern and sistern. It actually performed a service of economic beneﬁt to
many  people.  Unlike  the  Internet  fantasy  follies.  See  Figure  104.4  for  a  longer  per-
spective on Ebay. Lessons for the attentive: power of trendlines; alarm-clock nature
of unusual volume; not believing any forecast. Forecast in this case would have been
for a downtrend if, as seemed, the pattern was a descending triangle.

But they deviate from the true Triangles of this chapter so markedly in one
or  more  important  respect  that  they  are  best  treated  under  other  headings
elsewhere. Such are the Flags, Pennants, and Wedges. Still another group of

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

The  reader  may  have  become  dismayed  at  this  point  by  our  frequent
recourse  to  such  qualifying  adverbs  as  usually,  ordinarily,  and  the  like.  It
cannot be avoided if one wishes to present a true picture of what actually
happens. No two chart patterns are ever precisely alike; no two market trends
develop  in  quite  the  same  way.  History  repeats  itself  in  the  stock  market,
but never exactly. Nevertheless, the investor who familiarizes himself with
the  historical  pattern,  with  the  normal  market  action,  and  refuses  to  be
tempted  into  a  commitment  in  the  belief  that  “this  time  will  be  different,”
will be far and away ahead of the fellow who looks for the exception rather
than the rule.

The  beginner  is  proverbially  lucky.  He  will  ﬁnd  Triangles,  Head-and-
Shoulders,  or  other  signiﬁcant  patterns,  one  after  the  other,  on  his  charts,
watch  them  develop,  and  see  them  carry  through  with  proﬁtable  moves
according  to  rule.  And  then  the  exception  will  come  along  —  or  he  will
overlook  the  larger  picture  while  concentrating  on  some  Minor  Pattern
development — and suddenly awake to the fact that he is caught in a very
bad play. Hence our constant emphasis on the nonconforming movements.
Our words of qualiﬁcation are necessary because technical analysis of market
action is not an exact science and never will be.

The Triangular Price Formations which we examined in the preceding chapter
can be either 
 Patterns. In the case of the Right-Angle
Triangles, we know as soon as they have attained recognizable form in which
direction the trend will (or should) proceed. With the Symmetrical Triangles,
we  have  no  way  of  knowing  whether  they  point  up  or  down  until  prices
ﬁnally break away from them, although the odds are, as we have seen, that
the  previous  trend  will  be  continued  rather  than  reversed.  In  this  respect

and  in  many  others,  our  next  class  of  technical  formations,  the

 consists of a series of sideways price ﬂuctuations, a “trading
area,” as it is sometimes called, which can be bounded both top and bottom
by 
 lines. A glance at any one of the examples which illustrate these
pages will show how it got its name. On rare occasions, you may discover a
chart  pattern  whose  upper  and  lower  boundary  lines  are  parallel  but  either
slightly down-sloping or up-sloping. So long as their departure from the hor-
izontal  is  trivial,  they  may  be  treated  as  Rectangles.  You  will  also  ﬁnd,  on
occasion, patterns whose boundaries, while nearly horizontal, tend somewhat
to converge. These may be considered Rectangles or Symmetrical Triangles; it
doesn’t matter which, since the “prognosis” will be the same in either case.

If you will give a quick mental review also to the Head-and-Shoulders,
the Complex and the Rounding types of formations, you will see how, if you
disregard  the  volume  part  of  their  charts,  any  one  of  these  patterns  might
merge  or  grade  into  a  Rectangle.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  however,  you  will
seldom be left in doubt as to proper classiﬁcation because the circumstances
of  trading,  the  type  of  buying  and  selling,  which  produce  Rectangles  are
different and that difference is usually apparent.

We characterized the Symmetrical Triangle as a “picture of doubt.” The
Rectangle might, with even greater propriety, be called a picture of conﬂict.
Of  course,  any  fairly  compact  price  formation  represents  conﬂict  in  the
supply–demand sense. A Head-and-Shoulders Top, for example, portrays a
conﬂict  between  “strong”  sellers  and  “weak”  buyers,  with  the  outcome

already  clearly  to  be  seen  before  the  combat  has  ended.  But  a  Rectangle
deﬁnes  a  contest  between  two  groups  of  approximately  equal  strength  —
between owners of the stock who wish to dispose of their shares at a certain
price and others who wish to accumulate the stock at a certain lower ﬁgure.
They bat the ball back and forth (up and down, that is) between them until
ultimately,  and  usually  quite  suddenly,  one  team  is  exhausted  (or  changes
its mind) and the other then proceeds to knock the ball out of the lot. Nobody
(often,  not  even  the  contestants  themselves)  can  tell  who  is  going  to  win
until one line or the other is decisively broken.

We speak of two groups operating in the development of a rectangular
trading area because, under present-day conditions, that is what is usually
the fact behind the scenes. This, it should be noted, does not imply “manip-
ulation” in any invidious sense. An investment trust or an estate or, in some
cases, an individual heavy stockholder has good and sufﬁcient reasons for
selling at the top price (the “Supply Line” of the Rectangle) with no intent
to mislead the public. And another investment trust or a group of insiders
interested in the company may have equally good and, from their point of
view,  wise  reasons  for  buying  at  the  bottom  price  (“Demand  Line”).  Such
are the forces at work in the market at the start of most Rectangular Chart
Patterns, but if the “spread” between top and bottom lines is wide enough
(say 8–10% of the market value of the stock), the situation may quickly attract
a following from quick-turn scalpers and the professional element. Thus, a

Consolidation Rectangles in uptrends have been less common in recent
years than during the 1920s and early 1930s. The large price gap (G) in this example
is  of  the  “last  in  pattern”  type  which  we  shall  come  to  in  Chapter 12.  When  a  gap
within a pattern area is followed by breakout from that pattern, as in this case, the
gap is seldom quickly closed.

syndicate holding a large block of U.S. Steel may decide to liquidate at 76,
while another group decides to invest heavily in “Steel” at 69. The price of
X will naturally ﬂuctuate for a time between those two levels. Traders, seeing
this, will try to “ride the play,” buying at 69 and selling at 76 (perhaps also
selling short at 76 and covering at 69). Their operations will tend to accen-
tuate  or  extend  the  Rectangle,  although  the  number  of  shares  involved  in
such “parasitic” trading is seldom great enough to affect the ﬁnal outcome.
As  a  matter  of  fact,  this  type  of  trading 
  a  Rectangle  can  be  quite
proﬁtable at times, especially if protected by judicious stops (see Part Two).

Pool Operations

In  times  past,  before  the  SEC  outlawed  the  practice,  Rectangles  were  fre-
quently created by the well-organized operations of a single “pool” or syn-
dicate. Such a pool might undertake to accumulate a large block of stock in
a  certain  company  with  a  view  to  marking  it  up  and  taking  proﬁts  when
some piece of good news, of which they had inside knowledge, eventually
became  public.  In  order  to  acquire  the  desired  “line,”  they  would  ﬁnd  it
necessary  ﬁrst  to  shake  out  shares  held  by  other  traders  and  uninformed
investors. They might start their campaign by suddenly selling short a few
hundred shares in order to quench any current demand and start a reaction.
Then, on that reaction to the previously determined accumulation level, they
would start to buy, scattering their orders carefully and avoiding any publicity.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Their buying would, sooner or later, engender a rally, but then they would
“plant”  rumors  around  the  boardrooms  to  the  effect  that  such-and-such
insiders  were  selling,  or  that  a  projected  merger  was  being  called  off,  or  a
dividend  would  have  to  be  passed,  and,  if  necessary,  they  would  osten-
tatiously let out a few of their own recently purchased shares to give color
to the rumor. The process might be repeated several times, with the “pool”
gradually  securing  more  and  more  shares  on  balance,  until  ﬁnally,  it  had
completed  its  intended  line,  or  could  shake  out  no  more  of  the  ﬂoating
supply. Often, what was going on was fairly evident to the alert chartist back
in the 1920s even before the operation was concluded, and perfectly evident,
of course, as soon as prices broke out topside from their Rectangle.

But such tactics are no longer permitted. “Wash sales” are strictly con-
demned.  The  constant  policing  of  all  exchange  transactions  and  prompt
investigation by the SEC of any suspicious news or activity in a stock effec-
tually deters the blatant “pool” manipulations of previous years. This prob-
ably is the chief reason why Rectangles are nowhere near so common on the
charts of the 1950s as they were in the 1920s.

Perhaps we can clear up various details of the Rectangle formation most
quickly and easily by comparison with that most nearly related chart pattern,
the Symmetrical Triangle, as follows:

Volume —

 Follows the same rules as in the Triangles, gradually dimin-
ishing as the Rectangle lengthens. Any contrary development, unless
it be a momentary news ﬂurry, is suspect.

Breakouts —

 Here also the same rules apply as with Triangles. Review

volume requirements, margin of penetration, etc., thereunder.

False Moves

 — Much less frequent from Rectangles than from Symmet-
rical Triangles. A clearly deﬁned Rectangle is, in fact, almost as reli-
able  as  a  Head-and-Shoulders,  although  not  as  powerful  in  its
implications.

Premature Breakouts —

 Slightly more frequent, perhaps, from Rectan-

gles than from Triangles.

 Return of prices to the boundary of the pattern, subsequent
to its initial penetration (breakout), takes place more frequently with
Rectangles than with Symmetrical Triangles. Our estimate would be
that a Pullback or Throwback (the ﬁrst is the common term for a rally
after a downside breakout, and the second for a reaction following

Bottoms,  sometimes  grading  into  the  type  of  Flat-Bottomed  Saucer

farther.  Generally  speaking,  the  brief,  wide-swinging  forms,  which
appear nearly square in shape on the chart and in which turnover is
active,  are  more  dynamic  than  the  longer  and  narrower  manifesta-
tions. Moves out of the latter almost always hesitate or react at the
“minimum” point before carrying on.

Relation of Rectangle to Dow Line

The  resemblance  of  this  individual  stock  chart  formation,  which  we  have
discussed under the name of Rectangle, to the Average formation known to
Dow  theorists  as  a  “Line”  has  doubtless  occurred  to  you.  Obviously,  their
rationale and forecasting implications are much the same. But true Rectan-
gles with sharply delimited Top (Supply) and Bottom (Demand) boundaries
are truly characteristic only of trading in individual issues. Line formations
in  the  Averages  are  seldom  rigorously  deﬁned,  with  successive  Minor
Heights forming quite precisely at a certain horizontal tangent, and succes-
sive Bottoms at a similarly precise horizontal level. If you will examine the
separate  charts  of  the  issues  composing  an  Average  at  a  time  when  the

Another long, loose Rectangle of Major Reversal implications, some-
what  similar  to  that  pictured  in  Figure 68.  Both  an  Intermediate  and  Major  Up
Trendline (to be discussed later) were decisively punctured by “YB” in August, just
before its Rectangle broke down. Under Figure 64, we discussed one sort of warning
of  a  Primary  Downturn  which  may  be  derived  from  the  comparison  of  individual
stock charts with the Averages. Here is another hint: The better-grade steels and oils
(see “SOV,” Figure 71) frequently hold up, or make stronger Secondary Recoveries,
after the Averages have turned down at Major Tops. The Street sometimes speaks of
“distribution under cover of strength in the steels.”

Average is “making a Line,” you are pretty sure to ﬁnd that some of them
are showing an irregular uptrend, others an irregular downtrend, still others
may  be  forming  Triangles,  and  a  few  may  be  constructing  Rectangles,  or
what  not,  but  it  is  the  algebraic  sum  of  all  these  more  or  less  divergent
pictures which makes up the Average “Line.”

To  be  sure,  there  is  some  tendency  on  the  part  of  active  traders  to  sell
(or buy) stocks when a certain Average reaches a certain ﬁgure, regardless
of the status of individual issues involved. An investment counsel will occa-
sionally advise his clients, for example, to “sell all speculative holdings when
).” But trading commit-

sistently that they have little effect.

Rectangles from Right-Angle Triangles

In  the  preceding  chapter,  we  referred  to  a  type  of  partial  “failure”  in  the
development of a Right-Angle Triangle which necessitates reclassifying the
Triangle  as  a  Rectangle.  Now  that  we  have  examined  the  latter  pattern  in
detail, we need say little more about this phenomenon, except to note that

FIGURE 73.
The Rectangle in early 1945 in “EAL” was actually the ﬁnal stage of
a nearly 2-year Consolidation in the rise which started around 17 in 1942 and ended
above 125 in December 1945. G, G mark gaps (Chapter 12), the ﬁrst a Breakaway and
the  second  a  Measuring  Gap  which  marked  the  probable  objective  of  the  move  as
55. When prices reached that level, another Consolidation developed, a Symmetrical
Triangle. Neither of these gaps was “closed” during the following 2 years.

the  odds  appear  to  be  still  somewhat  in  favor  of  ultimate  breakout  in  the
direction originally implied by the incipient Triangle. The fact that there is
this  slight  presumption,  however,  certainly  does  not  warrant  disregard  of
an opposite breakout from the rectangular reconstruction.

Double and Triple Tops and Bottoms

Double Top

To  some  of  the  old  hands  in  the  Street,  our  relegation  of  that  good  old
byword, the 
, to a Minor Position in our array of Reversal Forma-
tions may seem almost sacrilegious. It is referred to by name perhaps more
often  than  any  other  chart  pattern  by  traders  who  possess  a  smattering  of
technical  “lingo”  but  little  organized  knowledge  of  technical  facts.  True
Double  Tops  and  Double  Bottoms  are  exceedingly  rare;  Triple  Forms  are
even rarer. And the true patterns (as distinguished from chart pictures which
might  mistakenly  be  called  such,  but  are  really  assignable  to  some  one  of
our other Reversal Formations) can seldom be positively detected until prices
have  gone  quite  a  long  way  away  from  them.  They  can  never  be  foretold,
or identiﬁed as soon as they occur, from chart data alone.

FIGURE 75.
In this weekly chart showing Sears Roebuck’s 1942 Bear Market Bot-
tom,  a  Consolidation  Rectangle  (June  to  November)  forms  the  right  shoulder  of  a
large “unbalanced” Double Head-and-Shoulders Pattern.

Double Top

But we are getting ahead of our story. We should ﬁrst deﬁne what we
are talking about. A 
 is formed when a stock advances to a certain
level  with,  usually,  high  volume  at  and  approaching  the  Top  ﬁgure,  then
retreats  with  diminishing  activity,  then  comes  up  again  to  the  same  (or
practically the same) top price as before with some pickup in turnover, but
not as much as on the ﬁrst peak, and then ﬁnally turns down a second time
for  a  Major  or  Consequential  Intermediate  Decline. A 
is,  of
course, the same picture upside down. The Triple types make three Tops (or
Bottoms) instead of two.

Double  Bottom 

It  isn’t  difﬁcult  to  skim  through  a  book  of  several  hundred  monthly
charts and pick out two or three examples of Major Double Tops, perhaps
one  or  two  Double  Bottoms.  One  will  ﬁnd  cases  where  stocks  made  two
successive Bull Market Peaks, several years apart, at almost identical levels.
Such  phenomena  stand  out,  in  distant  retrospect,  like  the  proverbial  sore
thumb,  which  undoubtedly  accounts  for  the  undue  awe  with  which  the
amateur chartist regards them. He neglects, for the moment, to consider the
fact  that  a  thousand  other  issues  might  have  done  the  same  thing,  but
didn’t —  that  some  of  these  even  acted,  for  a  time,  as  though  they  were
going to Double Top, but then went on through and higher.

Is there any practical utility for the trader or investor in the Double Top
concept? Yes, there is, but it will be easier for us to formulate it if we ﬁrst

After advancing to 16 in January 1945, “BLL” dropped back to 13 and
then constructed a 15-week Rectangle. Note that the down gap (G) on April 30 was
caused by a $1.00 dividend going off. The revised bottom line of the pattern, drawn
$1.00 lower, was not violated.

consider what is 
 a Double Top. Refer back for a moment to the Ascending
Triangles and the Rectangles previously studied. When these start to evolve,
almost  their  ﬁrst  step  is  the  construction  of  two  Tops  at  an  identical  level
with an intervening recession, and with less volume on the second Top than
on the ﬁrst. In the ordinary course of events, a third Top will develop there,
and  ultimately,  prices  will  break  through  and  move  on  up  to  still  higher
levels.  Thus,  we  see  we  must  have  some  rule  or  criterion  to  distinguish  a
true Double Top Reversal Pattern from the Double Tops which do not imply
Reversal when they appear as a part of a Consolidation Area in an uptrend.

Distinguishing Characteristics

No absolute and unqualiﬁed rule can be laid down to ﬁt all cases involving
stocks  of  different  values  and  market  habits,  but  one  relative  distinction
quickly suggests itself when we study these different kinds of chart forma-
tions. It is: if two Tops appear at the same level but quite close together in
time  and  with  only  a  Minor  Reaction  between  them,  the  chances  are  that
they are part of a Consolidation Area; or, if a Reversal of Trend is to ensue,

that there will ﬁrst be more pattern development — more “work” done —
around  those  top  ranges.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  there  is  a  long,  dull,  deep,
and more or less rounding reaction after the initial peak has appeared, and
then an evident lack of vitality when prices come up again to the previous
high, we can at least be suspicious of a Double Top.

How  deep  is  deep,  and  how  long  is  long?  Fair  questions,  to  which,
unfortunately, it is impossible to give simple, deﬁnite answers. But we can
attempt approximations. Thus, if the two Tops are 
 a month apart,
they are not likely to belong to the same Consolidation or Congestion For-
mation. If, in addition, the reaction between the ﬁrst and second high reduces
prices by 20% of their top value, the odds swing toward a Double Top inter-
pretation.  But  both  of  these  criteria  are  arbitrary,  and  not  without  exception.

This formation, constructed by United Aircraft in 1942, was not com-

1943. (See following pages.)

There  are  cases  in  which  the  two  peaks  have  occurred  only  2  or  3  weeks
apart, and others in which the “valley” between them descended only about
15%. Most true Double Tops, however, develop 2 or 3 months or more apart.
Generally speaking, the time element is more critical than the depth of the
reaction.  The  greater  the  time  between  the  two  highs,  the  less  the  need  of
any extensive decline of prices in the interim.

Given the conditions we have speciﬁed, viz., two Tops at approximately
the  same  level  but  more  than  a  month  apart  on  the  chart,  with  somewhat
less  activity  on  the  second  advance  than  on  the  ﬁrst,  and  a  rather  dull  or
irregular  and  rounding  type  of  recession  between  them,  we  can  then  be
suspicious that a Double Top Reversal has actually evolved. Should a small
Head-and-Shoulders or Descending Triangle start to develop at the second
Top, as is frequently the case, we can be on guard, to the extent of protecting
long commitments at once with a close stop or switching to something else
with a more promising chart picture.

Yet, even all these signs together are not ﬁnal and conclusive. The situ-
ation can still be saved, and often is. Let us take a look at what is, presumably,
going on behind the scenes to create our chart picture up to this point. The
ﬁrst Top on relatively high volume was a normal incident and tells us little
except that here, for the moment, demand met with sufﬁcient supply to stop

INCO quickly recovered from the Reagan Crash of 1987 and by year’s
end,  it  was  nearly  back  to  its  1987  high;  the  latter  was  decisively  broken  in  April
1988.  The  powerful  rally  continued  to  carry  “N”  higher.  But  the  August  reaction,
followed by a poor rally in September, created a large Head-and-Shoulders Top. The
early  September  decline  broke  the  neckline  to  conﬁrm  the  Reversal  and  the  subse-
quent Throwback, to Neckline Resistance, was an excellent selling point.

the advance and produce a reaction. That supply may have represented only
traders’ proﬁt-taking, in which event the trend is likely to push on up after
a brief setback. But, when the reaction drifts off lower and lower until it has
given up 15% and more of the stock’s peak market value, and ﬂattens out
without any prompt and vigorous rebound, it becomes evidence that either
the demand was pretty well played out on the last advance or that the selling
there represented something more than short-term proﬁt cashing. The ques-
tion then is: did the ﬁrst high give evidence of important distribution, and
is there much more to meet at the same price range?

Nevertheless,  as  our  chart  picture  shows,  demand  did  ﬁnally  come  in
and absorb enough of the ﬂoating supply to turn the trend around. When
prices pushed up and began to run into selling again near the level of the
ﬁrst Top, that was to be expected on “psychological” grounds; many quick-
turn  operators  naturally  would  take  proﬁts  at  the  old  high  (perhaps  with
the intention of jumping right back in at a still higher price if the old high
should  be  exceeded).  Hence,  a  Minor  Hesitation  there  was  quite  in  order.
But selling in sufﬁcient quantity to produce another extensive reaction would
be quite another matter. We have, by now, established a zone of Supply or

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Resistance at the peak levels and a zone of Support or Demand at the Bottom
of  the  valley  between.  The  ﬁnal  and  decisive  question  now  is:  will  the
“valley” Support reappear and stop the second decline?

The conclusive deﬁnition of a Double Top is given by a negative answer
to that last question. If prices, on their recession from the second peak, drop
through the Bottom level of the valley, a Reversal of Trend from up to down
is signaled. And it is usually a signal of major importance. Fully conﬁrmed
Double  Tops  seldom  appear  at  turns  in  the  Intermediate  Trend;  they  are
characteristically  a  Primary  Reversal  phenomenon.  Hence,  when  you  are
sure  you  have  one,  do  not  scorn  it.  Even  though  prices  may  have  already
receded 20%, the chances are they have very much farther to go before they
reach bottom.

As to measuring implications, the Double Top affords no formula com-
parable  with  that  we  have  attributed  to  Head-and-Shoulders  and  Triangle
at least as
Formations, but it is safe to assume that the decline will continue 
far
 below the valley level as the distance from peak to valley. It may not be
so,  of  course,  in  one  interrupted  slide;  on  the  contrary,  considerable  time
may be required to carry out the full descent in a series of waves. Pullbacks
to the “valley” price range, following the ﬁrst breakthrough, are not uncom-
mon. (Bear in mind the general rule that a Reversal Formation can be expected
to produce no more than a retracement of the trend which preceded it.)

One more point: we have said that the Tops need not form at precisely
the  same  level.  Use  here  the  3%  rule  we  have  previously  laid  down  as  a
measuring stick for breakouts. A ﬁrst Top at 50, for example, and a second
at  51
  would  come  within  this  limit.  Curiously  enough,  the  second  peak
often  does  exceed  the  ﬁrst  by  a  fraction.  The  important  points  are  (1)  that
buying cannot push prices up into the clear 
, and (2) the
Support below is subsequently broken.

Double Bottoms

In  identifying  a  Double  Bottom,  we  can  apply  all  of  the  precepts  we  have
formulated  for  the  Double  Top  Pattern,  but,  of  course,  upside  down.  The
differences between the two pictures are just what you might expect them
to be, having in mind the characteristic differences between Head-and-Shoul-
ders  Tops  and  Bottoms,  for  example.  Thus,  the  second  Bottom  is  usually
conspicuously  dull  (little  trading  volume)  and  is  apt  to  be  quite  rounded,
whereas the second Top in a Double Top is moderately active and nearly as
sharp  and  “spiky”  in  contour  as  the  ﬁrst.  The  rally  up  from  the  second
Bottom  shows  an  increase  in  turnover,  and  volume  should  pick  up  to  a
height
marked degree as the valley level, or more properly, in this case, the 
between the two Bottoms, is surpassed. Double Bottoms appear just about
as  frequently  as  do  Double  Tops  at  Primary  Trend  Reversals,  and  Double
Bottoms  also  occur  sometimes  at  the  end  of  Intermediate  Corrections  in  a
Major Uptrend.

Shares of “AMR,” then selling for around 90, were split 5-for-1 in April
1946, resulting in a quick rally to a new high. But the overall aspect of a Double Top
with  the  high  made  the  previous  December  was  nevertheless  apparent,  and  was
conﬁrmed when prices broke down through the “valley” level on August 28. Popular
buying  brought  in  by  “splits”  is  usually  short-lived  and  only  temporarily  distorts
the broad picture.

If you are familiar with some of the jargon of the Street, it has probably
occurred  to  you  that  the  second  low  of  a  Double  Bottom  is  an  example  of
the market action so often referred to as a “test.” In a sense, that is just what
it is — a test or corroboration of the Support (i.e., demand) which stemmed

however — and this is a point to remember — until prices have demonstrated
their ability to rise on increasing volume above the preceding high (the height
of the rally between the two Bottoms). Until such time as that has happened,
there  is  always  the  possibility  that  a  second  test  (third  bottom)  may  be
necessary,  or  even  a  third,  and  that  one  of  these  will  fail,  with  prices  then
breaking  on  down  into  further  decline.  This  thought  leads  us  to  our  next
type of Reversal Formation.

Triple Tops and Bottoms

Logically, if there are Double Tops, then we might expect that there will also
be Triple Tops, which will develop in somewhat similar fashion. Fact is that
Reversal Formations, which can only be classed as Triple Tops, do occur, but
they  are  few  and  far  between.  Of  course,  there  are  many  patterns  evolved
at an important turn from up to down in the trend which contain three Top
points, but most of these fall more readily into the category of Rectangles.
For  that  matter,  any  Head-and-Shoulders  Formation,  particularly  if  it  be
rather “ﬂat,” with the head not extending much above the level of the two
shoulders, might be called a sort of Triple Top.

The true Triple Top (as distinct, that is, from other types of three-peak
formations) carries a recognizable family resemblance to the Double Top. Its
Tops are widely spaced and with quite deep and usually rounding reactions
between them. Volume is characteristically less on the second advance than
on  the  ﬁrst,  and  still  less  on  the  third,  which  often  peters  out  with  no
appreciable pickup in activity. The three highs need not be spaced quite so

Although  Trinity  Industries  did  not  have  the  well-formed  pattern
exhibited  by  our  other  recommendations,  we  found  the  high-volume  plunge,  with
the low of the day the third test of the year’s low, a very beguiling technical situation.
Basically, it was a Triple Bottom with a One-Day Reversal to get the uptrend started.

far  apart  as  the  two  which  constitute  a  Double  Top,  and  they  need  not  be
equally  spaced.  Thus,  the  second  Top  may  occur  only  about  3  weeks  after
the ﬁrst, and the third 6 weeks or more after the second. Also, the intervening
valleys  need  not  bottom  out  at  exactly  the  same  level;  the  ﬁrst  may  be
shallower than the second and vice versa. And the three highs may not come
at precisely the same price; our 3% tolerance rule is again useful here. Yet,
despite  all  these  permissible  variations,  there  should  be,  and  generally  is,
something suspiciously familiar about the overall picture, something which
immediately suggests the possibility of a Triple Top to the experienced chartist.
 test, however, is a decline from the third Top which breaks
prices down through the level of the valley ﬂoor (the lower one, if the two
valleys form at different levels). Not until that has occurred can a Triple Top
be  regarded  as  conﬁrmed  and  actually  in  effect,  since  so  long  as  demand
persists at the valley price range, the trend can be turned up again. Only in
those  cases  where  activity  is  conspicuously  lacking  on  the  third  peak  and
then  begins  to  show  Bearish  characteristics  by  accelerating  on  the  ensuing
decline is one justiﬁed in “jumping the gun.”

The 

Triple  Bottoms  are  simply  Triple  Tops  turned  upside  down,  with  the
same qualiﬁcations we noted when we were discussing Double Bottoms. The
third low should always be attended by small volume, and the rise therefrom
must show a decided increase in turnover and carry prices decisively  above

the Tops of the rallies that formed between the Bottoms. One is never justiﬁed
in “jumping the gun” on a presumed Triple Bottom Formation unless nearly
every other chart in the book is in an unmistakably Bullish position. The risk
of  premature  buying  is  expressed  in  a  saying  one  sometimes  hears  in  the
boardrooms to the effect that “a Triple Bottom is always broken.” This is not
a true saying. Once a Triple Bottom has been established and conﬁrmed by
the  necessary  up-side  breakout,  it  seldom  fails — almost  always  produces
an advance of distinctly worthwhile proportions. But an uncompleted “pos-
sible” Triple Bottom chart picture must be regarded as treacherous. Stick to
the breakout rule and you will be safe.

Triple Tops are sometimes referred to as “W” Patterns because of their
occasional resemblance to that capital letter on the chart. There is a sort of
hybrid between the Double and Triple Top, in which the middle one of the
three  Tops  does  not  attain  the  height  of  the  ﬁrst  and  third,  and  thus,  even
more  strikingly  resembles  a  “W.”  For  the  same  reason,  Double  Tops  are
sometimes called “M” Formations.

Because the elements in Double and Triple patterns are normally spaced
well apart in time, they are often easier to detect and appreciate on a weekly

In  the  ordinary  course  of  events,  at  the  time  this  Bottom  Pattern
developed in “NG,” consisting, as it did, of ﬂuctuations for 10 long months within
a range of only 1 full point, most traders would pay no attention to it. Certainly it
suggested very little opportunity for short-term proﬁts. On an arithmetically scaled
chart,  the  pattern  could  hardly  be  seen.  Logarithmic  price  scaling,  however,  as  we
have remarked in an earlier chapter, has the great advantage of bringing to light the
percentage importance of signiﬁcant market action at very low price levels.

Note  that  this  formation  qualiﬁes  in  every  detail  —  spacing  between  Bottoms,
extent in percent of intervening rallies, volume — as a Triple Bottom. Of course, its
completion, in October 1942, did not necessarily forecast that “NG” would climb to
33, as it ultimately did. But the fact that many other stocks were making sound Major
Bottom  Formations  at  higher  price  levels  at  the  same  time  certainly  warranted  the
conclusion that “NG” was on its way up, and that it was a bargain at 5.

sometimes long before it has reached a conclusive stage. This is a not uncom-

study and long experience (in which the latter usually involves a few expen-
sive mistakes). The reader of this book need not despair of acquiring “chart

not exceptions. Its ﬁner points defy expression in rule or precept. It requires
judgment in appraisal of many factors, some of which may seem, at times,
to conﬂict radically with others. But to call it an art, which implies the need
for genius, or at least for a high degree of native talent, is certainly improper.
Say, rather, that it demands skill, but a skill that can be acquired by anyone

Other Reversal Phenomena

We have considered so far seven classes of chart patterns which appear at
more  or  less  important  Reversals  of  direction  in  the  trend  of  prices.  They
were:

1. The Head-and-Shoulders
2. Multiple or Complex Head-and-Shoulders
3. Rounding Turns
4. Symmetrical Triangles
5. Right-Angle Triangles
6. Rectangles
7. Double and Triple Tops and Bottoms
8. One-Day Reversal

before

Of  these,  1,  2,  3,  and  7  develop  most  often  at  Major  Turns,  while  4,  5,
and 6 occur more frequently at Intermediate Stages. Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 5
give indication 
 they are completed as to which way the price trend is
likely to proceed from them. Numbers 4 and 6 give no such indication and,
as we have seen, are rather more apt to signal Consolidation or Continuation
than Reversal. But all of them can, and on occasion do, appear at both Major

and down.

We have yet to take up a few other technical patterns which, because of
their limited signiﬁcance, or their rarity, or their doubtful utility to the long-
term traders, have been relegated to the end of our Reversal studies.

The Broadening Formations

In concluding our discussion of Triangles in Chapter 8, we mentioned certain
types of price congestion or trading areas which have sometimes been called
“Inverted  Triangles”  because,  starting  with  very  narrow  ﬂuctuations,  they
widen out between diverging rather than converging boundary lines. Herein,
we  have  chosen  to  classify  them  instead  as 
  because,
except for that inverted resemblance in superﬁcial appearance, they are quite
different in nature and trend implications.

FIGURE 86.
The Symmetrical type of Broadening Formation, which develops most
frequently in the later and more “excited” stages of a Primary Bull Market, is perfectly
exempliﬁed  in  this  Crane  Company  chart.  Note  that  the  Broadening  Pattern  here
started to form in December 1945 after a 10% reaction; if it had formed on Top of a
rally,  it  would  have  been  suspected  as  a  possible  Broadening  Top.  Nevertheless,  it
carried the usual Bearish implications. “CR” topped out at 49

in June.

½

If the Symmetrical Triangle presents a picture of “doubt” awaiting clar-
iﬁcation, and the Rectangle a picture of controlled “conﬂict,” the Broadening
Formation may be said to suggest a market lacking intelligent sponsorship
and out of control — a situation, usually, in which the “public” is excitedly
committed and which is being whipped around by wild rumors. Note that
we say only that it suggests such a market. There are times when it is obvious
that those are precisely the conditions which create a Broadening Pattern in
prices,  and  there  are  other  times  when  the  reasons  for  it  are  obscure  or
undiscoverable.  Nevertheless,  the  very  fact  that  chart  pictures  of  this  type
make their appearance, as a rule, only at the end or in the ﬁnal phases of a
long Bull Market lends credence to our characterization of them.

Hence, after studying the charts for some 20 years and watching what
market action has followed the appearance of Broadening Price Patterns, we
have  come  to  the  conclusion  that  they  are  deﬁnitely  Bearish  in  purport  —
that, while further advance in price is not ruled out, the situation is, never-
theless,  approaching  a  dangerous  stage.  New  commitments  (purchases)
should not be made in a stock which produces a chart of this type, and any
previous commitments should be switched at once, or cashed in at the ﬁrst
good opportunity.

The Broadening Formation may evolve in any one of three forms, com-
parable,  respectively,  to  inverted  Symmetrical,  Ascending,  or  Descending

Triangles. The “Symmetrical” type, for example, consists of a series of price
ﬂuctuations across a horizontal axis, with each Minor Top higher and each
Minor Bottom lower than its predecessor. The pattern may thus be roughly
marked off by two diverging lines, the upper sloping up (from left to right)
and the lower sloping down. But these Broadening Patterns are characteris-
tically loose and irregular, whereas Symmetrical Triangles are normally reg-
ular and compact. The converging boundary lines of a Symmetrical Triangle
are clearly deﬁned as a rule, and the Tops and Bottoms within the formation
tend  to  fall  with  fair  precision  on  those  boundary  lines.  In  a  Broadening
Formation, the rallies and declines usually do not all stop at clearly marked
boundary lines.

Volume During Broadening Formations

Another  distinction  between  Triangle  and  Broadening  Formation  is  in  the
volume  chart.  The  construction  of  a  true  Triangle  is  attended,  as  we  have
seen, by diminishing activity, starting with high volume on the ﬁrst Minor
Reversal  which  initiates  the  pattern,  but  growing  less  and  less  as  prices
ﬂuctuate in ever smaller waves out toward the apex. Then activity picks up
again after prices have broken out of the Triangle, immediately and sharply
if the breakout is through the top side. With the Broadening Formation, on
the other hand, trading activity usually remains high and irregular through-
out its construction. If it develops after an advance, as is almost always the
case,  the  ﬁrst  Minor  Reversal  which  starts  the  pattern  will  occur  on  large
turnover, but so will the second rally in the pattern, and the third, and high
volume also frequently develops on one or more of its Minor Bottoms. The
whole picture — both price and volume — is, thus, one of wild and appar-
ently “unintelligent” swings.

As can easily be seen, under such circumstances, a true breakout from
the area may be difﬁcult, if not impossible, to detect at the time it eventuates.
The  volume  part  of  the  chart  obviously  furnishes  no  clue,  while  the  very
looseness and lack of deﬁnition of the price pattern prevents the drawing of
any line which surely says, “this far and no farther.” (We are referring now
to the “Symmetrical” type only of Broadening Formation.) Of course, once
prices  have  run  well  away,  either  up  or  down,  from  the  pattern  area,  it
becomes plain that a breakout has occurred, but by that time, it may be too
late  to  risk  a  trade  on  the  situation;  the  move  may  already  have  gone  too
far.  What  can  we  do  about  Broadening  Formations  then?  Well,  we  have
already  noted  that,  nine  times  out  of  ten,  they  carry  Bearish  implications.
They  appear  most  often  at  or  near  an  important  topping  out  of  the  trend.
Hence, it is reasonably safe to assume that prices, when they ﬁnally break
away from the formation, will go down, or if they do go up, will very soon
turn  around  and  come  back  down  again.  Therein  lies  one  answer  to  the
problem of what to do about a Broadening Formation.

advance

In  addition,  the  price  action  within  the  formation,  in  many  cases,  fur-
nishes  an 
  indication  of  breakout  direction.  If  the  trend  is  going  to
break  down  from  the  Broadening Area,  the  last  rally  within  the  area  may
fail  to  rise  as  high  as  its  predecessor,  thus  breaking  the  sequence  of  ever
higher  Tops  within  the  pattern. And,  alternatively,  if  the  trend  is  going  to
emerge on the top side, the last reaction within the pattern may fail to depress
prices as low as the preceding reaction. These “failures” within the pattern
occur,  as  we  have  stated,  in  a  majority  of  all  Broadening  Formations.  But
note  that  one  cannot  be  sure  of  such  a  signiﬁcant  development  (what  we
have  referred  to  above  as  a  failure,  for  lack  of  a  better  descriptive  name)
until prices go on and out the other side of the formation or, more precisely,
have exceeded the last preceding move in that direction by a decisive margin
(our 3% rule again).

A Typical Example

½

No  doubt  the  foregoing  paragraph  sounds  rather  complicated.  It  will  be
easier to visualize the development of a “failure” signal if we cite an example
using actual price ﬁgures. Easier yet, perhaps, if the reader will sketch out
our example on a scrap of chart paper. Suppose stock XYZ, after advancing
some 30 points on gradually increasing turnover, runs into heavy selling at
62 and reacts to 58. But there is still plenty of interest in the issue; it stops
at 58 and then swings up to a new peak at 63. It “churns” there for a day or
before  it  is  halted  by  another
two  and  drops  back  again,  this  time  to  56
burst of buying. Its third rally takes it up to 62, where it hesitates and falls
back to 59, but is then picked up again and carried on to 65. (By this time,
of course, a Broadening Formation has become evident on the chart.) At 65,
there is a great show of trading, followed by another reaction which drops
quotations quickly back to 60. Support appears there momentarily and prices
ﬂuctuate for 3 or 4 days between 60 and 62 and then fall away again, ﬁnally
to  close  at  56,  with  volume  running  high  all  through  this  phase. A  fourth
rally  starts,  but  now  the  traders  who  bought  in  at  60  on  the  preceding
downswing are frightened and looking for a chance to “get out even,” and
the advance is stiﬂed at that level. Quotations start to slip and soon are down
to 55, 
. When this occurs, the “failure” of the
preceding rally is conﬁrmed — its failure, that is, to rise above 65 and, thus,
carry on the Broadening Movement. The decline below 56, by virtue of that
failure, may be regarded as a breakout.

below the previous pattern Bottom

If you followed the foregoing example closely, you will have noted that
there can be (and very often are) Minor Fluctuations inside the pattern that
½
do not affect its outcome. Thus, the rise from 56
to 65 really consisted of 3
moves, ﬁrst from 56
to 62, then from 62 back to 59, and, ﬁnally, from 59 up
above
to 65. The reaction from 62 had no signiﬁcance so long as it stopped 
56
 and was succeeded by a new rise carrying beyond the previous pattern
high, which, in this case, had been 63.

The  example  just  detailed  is  one  of  the  more  common  types  in  which
the failure occurs on a rally and the breakout eventuates on the downside.
But it could have been converted into the opposite form if the last decline
had stopped at 60, and then, instead of ﬂuctuating for a few days between
60 and 62 and breaking down again, had pushed right back up and past 65.
That  action  would  have  given  us  a  failure  on  a  decline  and  an  upside
breakout. (The odds would be, however, that the ﬁnal Top was not far away.)

The Orthodox Broadening Top

There is one particular manifestation — a special case, as the mathematicians
might  say  —  of  the  Broadening  Price  Formation  whose  general  nature  we
have discussed in the preceding paragraphs. This particular form appeared
at the 1929 Tops of many of the active and popular stocks of that day, but
with  less  frequency  at  Bull  Market  highs  since  1929,  and  rarely  at  high-
volume Tops preceding extensive Intermediate Declines, as in 1933 and 1934.
Broadening Top
,
It is known to market technicians under the speciﬁc name of 
and  although  it  conforms  to  our  general  descriptions  for  all  Symmetrical
Broadening Price Patterns, it has been so precisely deﬁned, and so often cited
in technical writings, that we may well take some time to examine it.

The  Orthodox  Broadening  Top  has  three  peaks  at  successively  higher
levels and, between them, two Bottoms with the second Bottom lower than
the  ﬁrst.  The  assumption  has  been  that  it  is  completed  and  in  effect  as  an
important Reversal indication just as soon as the reaction from its third peak
carries below the level of its second Bottom.

Perhaps we can best see what this formation is like if we examine one
of the classic patterns which developed in 1929. Our chart (Figure 87) shows
the daily market action (price and volume) of Air Reduction from July 1 to
December  31  of  that  year.  We  have  numbered  from  1  to  5  the  signiﬁcant
turning  points  within  the  Broadening  Top  which  ended  that  stock’s  Bull
Market in October. A Broadening Price Pattern was not detectable, of course,
until prices had started to move up from the second Minor Low (point 4);

), followed
 and 
 2. New highs at 5 (
by then 3 had formed 
by the deﬁnite downside breakout at B (nearly 6% under 4), completed the
pattern and, according to the rules, signaled a Major Reversal Trend. In this
case, there can be no doubt as to the importance of the Reversal indication,
since,  as  our  chart  shows,  the  price  of Air  Reduction  dropped  from  above
220 on October 18 to below 80 on November 14, just 4 weeks later, and the
ﬁnal Bottom was not seen until nearly 3 years later in 1932!

There are some ﬁne points of this classic example which should be noted.

First,  a  new  high,  i.e.,  a  third  and  higher  Top,  was  made  at  5
  and  the
subsequent  reaction  was  halted  at  195,  well  above  4,  and  succeeded  by
renewed  advance.  This  looked  like  one  of  the  advance  notices  (“failures”)
to which we have referred on a preceding page, portending an upside break-
out. But the example before us will serve to emphasize the warning which

A small but perfect 1946 Broadening Top that formed at the end of a
3-month chart pattern which also had overall Broadening (and, hence, Bearish) as-
pects. The ﬁve critical points of Reversal are numbered on the chart. The “breakout”

rience, in at least four out of ﬁve Broadening Top Patterns, and may not fail
until it has regained two thirds of the preceding decline, although it usually
peters out around or even below the halfway mark.

This,  as  we  have  said,  is  a  classic  example;  there  were  many  others  at
that  time.  The  very  fact  that  so  many  did  evolve  at  the  1929  peak,  which
was followed by history’s most disastrous losses, probably accounts for the
extremely  Bearish  implications  market  technicians  have  ascribed  to  the
Broadening Top Formation. We regard it now with somewhat less awe; its
measuring implications are probably no greater than those of a large, high-
volume  Head-and-Shoulders,  but  it  is  a  pattern  characteristic  of  the  last
stages of a Primary Uptrend.

When they appear as plain and as compact as this example, Broadening
Tops on weekly charts carry very powerful Reversal indications. The Top of the ﬁfth

was pictured in Figure 16. The dashed lines on the above chart are trendlines — to

The  insistence  that  the  third  Top  (our  number  5),  when  followed  by  a
decline  below  the  second  Bottom  (our  number  4), 
  the  Reversal
Pattern  may  be  regarded,  in  the  light  of  experience,  as  setting  too  strict  a
limitation,  since  Broadening  Formations  do,  on  occasion,  go  on  to  make  a
fourth and higher Top. Yet this rule may be, and usually is, justiﬁed by the
fact  that  the  overall  indications  are  undeniably  Bearish  and,  hence,  one
should not wait too long to get out. On the other hand, the requirement that
there be a third Top does seem to be justiﬁed on the score that Major Reversals
are seldom completed until at least three attempts have been made to push
prices on in the direction of the previous trend. This is the reason, of course,
why pioneer technical students lumped together many formations under the
classiﬁcation  “Five-Point  Reversals.”  The  Broadening  Top  is  a  Five-Point
Reversal (our numbers 1 to 5) and, so, obviously is a Head-and-Shoulders.
A  Broadening  Top  might,  in  fact,  be  called  a  Head-and-Shoulders  with  a
high right shoulder and a down-sloping neckline.

Why No Broadening Bottoms?

All of the other types of Reversal Formations we have studied thus far can
occur as either Tops or Bottoms. They can develop at the end of a decline to
turn the trend up, or at the end of an advance to turn the trend down. But
this  does  not  seem  to  be  true  of  the  Broadening  Formation.  It  has  been
assumed in the past that Broadening Bottoms must exist, but the writer has

Broadening  tendencies  that  appear  on  monthly  charts,  or  very  wide

individual stocks over many years, and only one or two patterns which bore
a  resemblance  to  it  in  the  charts  of  the  Averages.  Apparently,  the  circum-
stances  that  create  Broadening  Formations  do  not  exist  after  a  prolonged
decline  in  prices.  This  would  seem  to  bear  out  our  earlier  characterization
of this sort of pattern as suggesting active, excited trading with much public
(and, hence, not too well informed or managed) participation. Such condi-
tions are naturally associated with the ﬁnal phases of a Bull Market.

Right-Angled Broadening Formations
Price patterns of the “Inverted Triangle” shape, having a horizontal Top or
Bottom boundary, occur about as often as the symmetrical type, which is to
say,  not  nearly  as  often  as  true  Triangles,  Rectangles,  etc.  In  the  mid-20th

the  true  Right-Angle  Triangle  with  a  horizontal  top  line  and  up-slanting

horizontal bottom boundary and a down-slanting top boundary is called a
Descending Triangle, we cannot apply these terms to the Inverted or Broad-
ening  Forms.  Generally  speaking,  Right-Angled  Broadening  Formations
carry Bearish implications, regardless of which side is horizontal, in nearly
the same degree as the symmetrical manifestations.

top  boundary

Obviously, however, they differ essentially from Symmetrical formations
in one respect: a horizontal side indicates either accumulation or distribution
at  a  ﬁxed  price,  depending,  of  course,  on  which  side  is  horizontal. And  it
follows,  logically,  that  any  decisive  break  through  that  horizontal  side  has
with  a
immediate  forceful  signiﬁcance.  Thus,  if  a  Broadening  Price  Pattern 
ﬂat
  develops  after  a  good  advance,  and  if  prices  ﬁnally  burst
up through that top line on high volume and close above it to a conclusive
extent (roughly 3%), then it is safe to assume that the preceding uptrend will
be  resumed  and  carried  on  for  a  worthwhile  move.  This  does  happen,
although it is rare. The odds favor the opposite, i.e., the eventual victory of
the forces of distribution which created the horizontal Top and a breakaway
into an extensive decline.

Moreover,  if  an  advance  is  to  ensue  from  a  Flat-Topped  Broadening
Formation,  the  chances  are  that  the  third  reaction  in  the  formation  will  be
attended by much diminished trading activity instead of the continued high
or  irregular  volume  which  is  characteristic  of  Bearish  Broadening  Move-
ments, and that either it or the fourth reaction will be halted and reversed
above
Consol-
 the low point of the preceding. This turns the formation into a 
idation Head-and-Shoulders
, a Continuation-of-Trend Pattern, which we shall
take up in Chapter 11. The message here for the trader owning a stock whose
chart  begins  to  develop  a  Broadening  Formation  of  this  type  is:  watch  the
third reaction. If it carries below the second and volume does not fall off to
a marked degree, sell out on the next rally. (You can always repurchase the
same stock if you wish, without much “loss of position” should prices ﬁnally
and, improbably, recover and push up through the Top.)

Right-Angled Broadening Formations with horizontal lower boundaries
(ﬂat Bottoms) almost always break down. Once prices have fallen below the
lower boundary line, there is frequently a Pullback Rally to that line, either
in a few days or in 2 or 3 weeks, similar to the Pullbacks that so often follow
the break down from a Head-and-Shoulders Top.

(Note that the third or fourth rally in a pattern which starts out as a Flat-
Bottomed  Broadening  Formation  may  fail  to  carry  prices  as  high  as  its
predecessor, in which case we have a Head-and-Shoulders to deal with. In
other words, every Head-and-Shoulders begins as a Broadening Formation.
And  the  statement  of  that  relation  takes  us  logically  to  our  next  type  of
Reversal picture.)

The Diamond

Diamond

The 
 Reversal Formation might be described either as a more or less
Complex Head-and-Shoulders with a V-shaped neckline, or as a Broadening
Formation which, after two or three “swings,” suddenly reverts into a regular
Triangle  which  is  nearly  always  of  the  Symmetrical  form.  So  far  as  the
accompanying volume pattern is concerned, the latter is possibly the better
description. Its name derives obviously from its pictorial resemblance to the
conventional diamond ﬁgure.

FIGURE  91.
Three  successive  reactions  in  “DG”  in  February–March  1945  made
successively  lower  Bottoms,  but  the  intervening  rallies  came  up  to  the  same  high
(about 21
), thus forming a Right-Angled Broadening Formation with a horizontal
Top (Supply) Line. Penetration of this technically important top line on April 16 was
a Bullish signal. The ﬂat-topped type of pattern does not necessarily portray a Bearish
situation.

Although  it  is  fairly  conspicuous  and  easily  detected  when  it  appears
on the charts, the Diamond is not a common pattern. Since its development
requires fairly active markets, it rarely occurs at Bottom Reversals. Its “nat-
ural habitat” is Major Tops and the High-Volume Tops which precede exten-
sive  Intermediate  Reactions.  Many  Multiple  Head-and-Shoulders  Forma-
tions are borderline Diamond cases; i.e., they permit the drawing of slightly
bent necklines. The reader is cautioned, however, against trying too hard to
make Diamonds out of price patterns of the Head-and-Shoulders type. There
is a temptation to do so because a V-shaped neckline may promise to give
an  earlier  (and,  hence,  more  proﬁtable)  breakout  signal  than  the  straight
neckline of the Head-and-Shoulders, but it is much safer to stick to the latter
unless  the  second  half  of  the  formation  consists  of  a  series  of  clean-cut,
converging  Minor  Fluctuations  which  plainly  demands  deﬁnition  by  con-
verging boundary lines, and unless activity shows some tendency to dimin-
ish during this period as it would in a Triangle.

The Diamond requires little further comment. Our illustrations will suf-
ﬁce to acquaint you with its typical details. It carries a minimum measuring
implication  which,  having  studied  the  Head-and-Shoulders  and  Triangle
at least
formulas, you can probably deduce for yourself. Prices should move 
as far
 from the breakout point as the greatest width in points of the pattern

from its Top (head) to Bottom (V in neckline). This, it must be emphasized,
is a minimum rule and subject only to the usual qualiﬁcation that a Reversal
Formation must have something to reverse. Generally, the new trend carries
prices eventually well beyond the minimum measurement.

Wedge Formations

All of the chart formations we have discussed up to this point can and do
develop at changes in the Major Trend of prices. A few of them seldom occur
at any other than a Major Reversal. We have now to consider three patterns
which  are  ordinarily  Minor,  or,  at  most,  only  Intermediate  in  their  trend
implications.  They  are  useful,  nevertheless,  in  trading  operations.  One  of
, we have already alluded to (in Chapter 8) as having some
them, the 
resemblance to the Triangles.

Wedge

The  Wedge  is  a  chart  formation  in  which  the  price  ﬂuctuations  are
conﬁned within converging straight (or practically straight) lines, but differ-
ing  from  a  Triangle  in  that  both  boundary  lines  either  slope  up  or  slope

Another example of the Flat-Topped type of Broadening Price Pattern
that appeared near the end of 1945. “LS” went on up to 63 in 1946. Prices broke out

the  lower  must,  of  course,  project  at  a  steeper  angle  than  the  upper.  In  a
Falling Wedge, the opposite is true.

Superﬁcially, one might think that since an Ascending Triangle, with one
horizontal and one up-line, is a Bullish picture, the Rising Wedge, with both
of its pattern lines up, should be even more Bullish. But such is not the case.
Remember  that  the  ﬂat  top  of  an Ascending  Triangle  signiﬁes  a  supply  of
shares being distributed at a ﬁxed price; when that supply has been absorbed
(and the rising lower boundary line indicates that it will be absorbed), the
pressure is off and prices will leap forward. In a Rising Wedge, on the other
hand, there is no evident barrier of supply to be vaulted, but rather, a gradual
petering out of investment interest. Prices advance, but each new up wave
is feebler than the last. Finally, demand fails entirely and the trend reverses.
Thus,  a  Rising  Wedge  typiﬁes  a  situation  which  is  growing  progressively
weaker

 in the technical sense.

Of course, it might be said that any advance in prices, no matter what
shape it may take on the chart, weakens the technical status of the market.
Prospective  buyers  are  —  or,  at  least,  should  be  —  more  reluctant  to  pay
high prices than low, and owners are more willing to sell at high prices than
at low; in other words, any sort of rise tends to increase supply and diminish
demand. (While theoretically true, the preceding statement must be qualiﬁed
by  the  fact  that  rising  prices  actually  attract  rather  than  discourage  public

buying.) The difference between a Rising Wedge and what might be called
a normal Uptrend Channel (of which we shall have more to say later) is that
the Wedge sets a sort of limit on the advance. Its converging boundary lines
focus on a point near where the advance will halt and reaction set in.

We  can  state  most  of  the  essential  facts  about  the  Up-Pointed  Wedge
Formation in a few short sentences. It can develop either as a sort of Topping-
Out  Pattern  on  a  previously  existing  uptrend,  or  start  to  form  right  at  the
Bottom of a preceding downtrend. It (the Wedge) normally takes more than
3 weeks to complete; a shorter pattern of this shape is nearly always better
classiﬁed  as  a  Pennant,  which  we  will  discuss  in  the  next  chapter.  Prices
almost always ﬂuctuate within the Wedge’s conﬁnes for at least two thirds
of the distance from the base (beginning of convergence) to the apex; in many
cases,  they  rise  clear  to  the  apex,  and  in  some,  they  actually  go  a  short
distance beyond, pushing on out at the Top in a last-gasp rally before col-
lapsing. Once prices break out of the Wedge downside, they usually waste
little time before declining in earnest. The ensuing drop ordinarily retraces
all  of  the  ground  gained  within  the  Wedge  itself,  and  sometimes  more.
Trading  volume  in  a  Wedge  tends  to  follow  the  regular  Triangle  Pattern,
diminishing gradually as prices move up toward the apex of the Wedge.

Technicians in the future will look back with amazement at the top
which put the exclamation point on the Bull ’90s. The most amazing thing being that
what was going on at the time was recognizable and subject to analysis with a ruler
(Cf.  Resources).  The  analysis  furthermore  indicated  that  the  party  was  over  (or  at
least the fat lady was in the process of singing). As Edwards noted the Broadening
Top 
 morphed into a Diamond, which threw
off  a  false  signal,  breaking  out  on  the  upside,  which  developed  into  another  trian-
gular-like  pattern  (could  be  looked  at  as  ragged  triangular  or  ascending  —  only
bottom line shown here), which after a head fake broke down made a modiﬁed V-
Bottom and returned to the top of what could be looked at as a monster rectangle.
The  top  horizontal  line,  drawn  in August  2000  stops  the  2001  rally  cold  and  from
there it is a slippery slide to the tragedy of September 11, 2001. It was obvious that
the investor had no business being long, and that trading strategy was in order. Was
there any prescience in recognizing the mulish sideways trend of the market? None
whatsoever. Is all this hindsight? The reader may see for himself by examining the
record of how this market was analyzed 
 by the John Magee Investment
Newsletter in Resources.

 appears in all
Except for the fact that it is pointed down, the 
respects like the rising form we have just described. But the price trend that
follows its completion differs in character. When prices break out of a Rising
Wedge, they usually fall away rapidly, but when they move out of a Falling
Wedge, they are more apt to drift sideways or in a dull “Saucering-around”
movement before they begin to rise. The Rising Wedge may, therefore, call
for  quick  action  to  secure  proﬁts,  while  with  a  Falling  Wedge,  the  trader
ordinarily can take his time about making his commitment for the ensuing
rise.

Both types should be well deﬁned on the chart. Unless a trend pattern
is  quite  compact  with  frequent  ﬂuctuations,  and  nicely  bounded  by  lines
which  clearly  converge  to  a  point,  and  unless  their  up  (or  down)  slant  is
marked, the Wedge construction must be considered doubtful. You will ﬁnd
borderline  cases  where  one  of  the  pattern  lines  so  nearly  approaches  the
horizontal in direction that it resembles a Right-Angle Triangle, and the latter
would,  of  course,  carry  quite  different  implications  for  future  trend  devel-
opment. It is difﬁcult to lay down any hard and fast rules for distinguishing
the two. If one boundary line is

tend to fall at about the same level, then the formation is more safely con-
strued as a Triangle. The reader need not let this problem worry him unduly,
as he will rarely be left in doubt for long after he has acquired a little experience
with charts. One soon gets to recognize the characteristic “symptoms” of the
different formations and make correct diagnoses almost instinctively.

FIGURE 98.
As U.S. Steel approached the Top of its Secondary Recovery in August
1937,  its  price  ﬂuctuations  tended  to  grow  narrower,  between  upward  sloping  but
converging boundaries, while volume diminished. This pattern — a Wedge — carried
a deﬁnitely Bearish message. The entire swing from July to the end of August was
essentially  a  Rounding  Top.  The  three  Gs  mark  Breakaway  Gaps  (Chapter 12),  the
last (September 7) made as prices broke down through a Support Level (Chapter 13).

Wedges on Weekly and Monthly Charts

Most true Wedges are too short-lived (seldom longer than 3 months) to take
on  a  recognizable  deﬁnition  on  a  monthly  chart,  but  they  may  be  spotted
occasionally  on  the  weeklies.  Long  continued,  gradual  downtrends,  when
plotted  on  arithmetic  scale,  sometimes  assume  the  Wedge  form.  Thus,  an
entire Major Bear Decline on any arithmetic monthly chart may appear like
a giant Falling Wedge. This is due to the fact that the up and down ﬂuctu-
ations which compose the Major Swing, while maintaining about the same
extent  in 
,  tend  to  shorten  in  terms  of  points  (dollars)  as  prices
move  from  higher  to  lower  levels.  Such  Major  chart  patterns  are  not,  of
course, the true Wedges we have discussed herein. When plotted on semi-
logarithmic scale, these same moves would normally show a Parallel or even
slightly widening, instead of Converging, Channel.

Rising Wedges Common in Bear Market Rallies

As a ﬁnal note, we might add that the Rising Wedge is a quite characteristic
pattern for Bear Market Rallies. It is so typical, in fact, that frequent appearance

of Wedges at a time when, after an extensive decline, there is some question
as to whether a new Bull Trend is in the making may be taken as evidence
that  the  Primary  Trend  is  still  down.  When  a  Major  Bear  Swing  ends  in  a
Head-and-Shoulders  Bottom,  the  last  Rising  Wedge  will  often  appear  as
prices rally from the left shoulder to the neckline, and just before they break
down  to  the  head  (ﬁnal  low). A  Rising  Wedge  on  an  arithmetically  scaled
weekly  chart  is  almost  invariably  a  Bear  Market  phenomenon,  expressing,
as it does, the diminishing vigor which is the normal property of any reaction
against a prevailing Primary Trend.

The One-Day Reversal

We referred in Chapter 6 to a price pattern known as the One-Day Reversal.
This  particular  technical  Reversal  indication,  when  taken  alone,  can  be
accorded  only  temporary  or  strong  Minor  Trend  signiﬁcance.  True,  it  may
appear at the very peak of a long advance, forming perhaps on the high day
of  the  head  in  a  Head-and-Shoulders  Pattern  which  will  be  followed  by  a
long decline, but it can hardly be credited with forecasting that entire decline;
all it really signaled was the turn in the “head” itself. A One-Day Reversal

Wedges seldom appear at Major Trend Reversals, but Schenley’s Bull
high in 1946 was made at the end of an 8-month Rising Wedge, plain to see on its
weekly chart. The dashed line at 60 marks a Support Level (see Chapter 13) which
served to stem the subsequent decline for 9 weeks.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

may  just  as  well  occur,  for  example,  at  the  beginning  (the  ﬁrst  peak)  of  a
Symmetrical Triangle which only Consolidates instead of Reversing the pre-
vious  uptrend.  Even  so,  it  serves,  as  you  can  see,  to  warn  us  of  at  least
temporary exhaustion of Bullish forces.

On the downside, a One-Day Reversal often appears in magniﬁed and
conspicuous form at the end of a Panic Sell-Off, in which case, it usually is
referred  to  as  a 
  or  Selling  Climax.  This  manifestation  of  it  has
special  signiﬁcance  which  we  shall  take  up  later.  First,  however,  just  what
is a One-Day Reversal?

Climax  Day

It is, to begin with, a day of unusually high volume, exceeding, as a rule,
by  a  notable  margin  any  trading  turnover  registered  in  any  one  market
session  for  several  months  past.  It  comes  after  a  fairly  long  and  steady
advance (or a similar decline), on which activity has been increasing grad-
ually.  Prices  push  right  ahead  from  the  opening  gong  as  if  nothing  could
stop them. Frequently, even the opening sales are so far beyond the previous
day’s  closing  level  as  to  leave  a  large  gap  on  the  chart.  (We  shall  discuss
gaps  later.)  The  tape  runs  late,  and  before  the  advance  (or  decline)  halts,
prices have been carried as far in an hour or two as three or four days would
ordinarily take them. But the halt does come ﬁnally, maybe at the end of the
ﬁrst  hour  or  perhaps  not  until  late  in  the  day.  Then  quotations  “churn,”
registering only fractional changes to and fro, with the tape still “fast” and
often running late by spurts. Suddenly the trend reverses and prices move
just as rapidly in the opposite direction. The session ends with a ﬁnal burst
of activity that puts the price at the close right back where it started the day.
There has been an enormous amount of activity, and quotations may have
traversed intraday a percentage range of 2 or 3%, but the net change from
the previous day at the end of trading is very small.

One-Day Reversals at Tops appear quite often in the charts of individual
stocks which are thin (relatively small ﬂoating supply of shares), which have
had  an  active  advance  and  have  attracted  a  large  public  following.  They
develop  rarely  in  the  Averages.  Selling  Climaxes  (One-Day  Reversals  at
Bottoms), on the other hand, are found conspicuously in the Averages at the
end of many abnormal or Panic Declines.

One-Day Reversals, as we have already stated, do not carry Major Trend
implications. The nimble in-and-out trader can capitalize on them — maybe
pick  up  several  points  if  he  has  funds  available  and  jumps  in  at  the  right
moment. But, as a rule, the new trend (i.e., the trend at the close of the day)
does  not  carry  very  far  right  away;  prices  usually  “work”  around  in  the
nearby ranges for some time and build some sort of area pattern before they
move away in a swing of Intermediate proportions. However, the One-Day
Reversal, as a phenomenon that occurs frequently within or at the start of
more  pregnant  technical  formations,  gives  an  important  clue  to  probable
trend developments. In any event, it is an urgent warning to watch closely
the chart in which it has appeared to see what pattern of price action may
follow and be prepared for the worthwhile move when it comes.

August  26.  It  is  suggested  that  the  reader  go  back  over  all  charts  in  preceding
chapters;  he  will  ﬁnd  many  Reversal  Days  of  greater  or  lesser  consequence.  Many
gaps (G) were of measuring type — see Chapter 12.

It  is  worth  noting  that  the  type  of  false  move  or  shakeout  that  we
described in Chapter 8 as occurring at the apex end of a Symmetrical Triangle
often takes the form of a One-Day Reversal.

The Selling Climax

In the “bad old days” when stocks could be bought by putting up as little
as 10% of their cost in cash, and there were no restrictions on short selling,
professional  operators  could  (and  tradition  says  they  often  did)  organize
Bear  Raids  to  shake  out  weakly  margined  holdings.  By  selling  short  in
quantity at a favorable moment when the “public” had gotten itself pretty
well extended on the long side, they could break prices down. Brokers then
would send out calls for more margin from their “long” accounts, many of
whom  could  not  or  would  not  put  it  up,  with  the  result  that  their  stocks
were dumped on the market. That, in turn, produced further declines. The
professionals could then step in, cover their shorts with a proﬁt, and secure
a  line  of  long  stock  for  the  next  advance.  Bear  Raids  of  this  sort  were
effectively  checked  by  the  imposition  of  the  SEC  regulations,  but  margin
calls  and  forced  selling  will,  of  course,  always  exist  as  a  market  factor  so
long as stocks can be bought on margin, and will come into play whenever
prices drop extensively following a spree of public buying.

Apple.  1987  Reagan  Crash.  Does  this  plunge  appear  to  be  out  of
the blue? Not really. Numerous signs are given: break of major trendline; short-term
momentum down before crash in an environment of extreme top psychology; then
the crash itself, the panic selling exhibiting the typical pattern of short covering, then
further decline.

Most  true  Selling  Climaxes,  if  not  all,  have  been  produced  by  distress
selling of the type referred to in the preceding paragraph. They have come
at the end of rapid and comprehensive declines which exhausted the margin
reserves of many speculators and necessitated the dumping of their shares
at whatever the market would bring. This process is progressive — feeding
upon  itself,  so  to  speak  —  with  each  wave  of  forced  sales  jeopardizing
another lot of margined accounts, until, at last, millions of shares are tossed
overboard, willy-nilly, in a ﬁnal clean-up. Such is a Selling Climax in which
the total turnover may exceed any single day’s volume during the previous
swing  up.  It  is  a  harvest  time  for  traders  who,  having  avoided  the  Bullish
infection  at  the  top  of  the  market,  have  funds  in  reserve  to  pick  up  stocks
available at panic prices.

Obviously, a clean-out day or Selling Climax radically reverses the tech-
nical  condition  of  the  market,  for  in  its  process,  shares  have  passed  from
weak  hands  into  strong  hands  at  very  much  lower  prices.  The  ominous
weight of potential selling that has been overhanging the market has been
removed.  And  usually  the  Panic  has  carried  quotations  (although  only

business conditions.

A  Selling  Climax  need  not  be  completed,  and  the  Reversal  of  Trend
actually become evident, within a single day. We have classiﬁed it as a variety
of One-Day Reversal, but some of them have actually spread out over 2 days,
with  the  decline  exhausted  and  coming  to  a  halt  late  on  the  ﬁrst  day,  too
near the end of the session to permit much recovery. The next day sees an
extensive rally right from the opening gong, as it is immediately apparent
then, if not late the preceding day, that there are no more distress offerings.
The all-time percentage record for Selling Climaxes is held by October 29,
1929. Prices in terms of the Dow–Jones Industrial Average opened that day
practically  at  their  high,  252.38,  which  was  more  than  8  points  below  the

day closed at 126.85, recovering its entire loss. Volume on that climax was
7,290,000  shares,  double  that  of  any  day  at  the  top  of  the  preceding  Bull
Market. An intraday high of 141.22 was reached 10 days later, but the Panic
Low was subsequently broken on November 20, 1937, and that Bear Market

The  two  outstanding  examples  of  Selling  Climaxes  that  we  have  cited
above,  and  numbers  of  others  which  have  appeared  at  the  conclusion  of
various Panic Sell-offs, obviously offered extraordinary opportunities for a
quick  turn  to  the  trader  who  was  smart  (or  lucky)  enough  to  get  in  at  the
bottom. He could cash in a few days later with exceptional proﬁts. Profes-
sional operators capitalize on such opportunities. The problem is to recog-
nize the climactic nature of the selling in time to seize the chance — and that
isn’t  as  easy  as  it  may  have  sounded  in  our  discussion.  Just  to  emphasize
the possibilities of error, there was a 30-point drop, followed by a 30-point
recovery, on a turnover of nearly 13 million shares, on October 24, 1929, but
the  trader  who  didn’t  grab  his  proﬁts  within  48 hours  never  had  another
chance to get out even (in terms of the Averages, that is).

FIGURE  104. The  Selling  Climax  discussed  on  the  preceding  pages  is  typically  a
1-day phenomenon, and on only one occasion (April 1939) in history has a general
market One-Day Reversal signaled the ﬁnal low of a Primary Bear Trend (although
many individual stocks evinced a Selling Climax on their charts in March 1938).

Occasionally,  a  weekly  chart  will  produce  a  formation  which  might  be  called  a
“One-Week Reversal,” in some such conspicuous fashion as is shown above in “NC.”
In this instance, the subsequent rise proves that a Major change in its technical balance
occurred  in  December  1941.  Curiously  enough,  no  other  obvious  Reversal  Pattern
appeared on the weekly chart at this turn in the Primary Trend of “NC.” (Its daily
chart  showed  an Ascending  Triangle.)  But  this  example  of  a  One-Week  Reversal  is
not shown to give the idea that such phenomena carry important technical indica-
tions.  On  the  contrary,  most  “Reversal  weeks”  are  followed  by  very  disappointing
moves.

perhaps  not  until  afternoon,  the  selling  appears  to  dry  up;  a  few  issues
continue to decline while others begin to climb. Suddenly prices are jumping.
That is the time to act. Buy a stock that has been thoroughly depressed but
one  which  normally  has  at  all  times  a  good  following  (for  example,  U.S.
Steel).  Don’t  hang  on  too  long;  take  a  reasonable  proﬁt  as  soon  as  it  is

available  and  sell,  in  any  event,  whenever  the  recovery  shows  signs  of
bogging down.

Remember, a One-Day Reversal is not a dependable Major Trend indi-
cator.  Selling  Climaxes  do  not  normally  occur  at  the  ﬁnal  Bottoms  of  Bear
Markets  —  weak  holdings  usually  have  been  shaken  out  long  before  that
stage is reached. Only one Primary Downtrend in all the record has, in fact,
ended  with  the  ﬁrst  Panic  Phase,  that  being  the  5-month  Bear  Market  of
1938–39 which was followed by an equally short Bull Market.

One remaining Reversal Formation, the Island Pattern, involves the whole
subject of Gaps which we have not yet had an appropriate occasion to discuss.
Gaps will be taken up in detail in Chapter 12, and we will defer the Island
Reversal until then.

Short-Term Phenomena 
of Potential Importance

Very short-term phenomena — of a one-day or a few days’ duration — can
sometimes be indicative of not only short-term direction, but also give hints
as to longer-term price behavior. Gaps (Chapter 12), and One-Day Reversals
(Chapter 10), which have been discussed, belong to this group. Other short-
term patterns of interest include Spikes, Key Reversal Days (sometimes called
merely  Reversal  Days),  and  Runaway  Days  (sometimes  called  Wide-Ranging
Days).

Spikes

On the day it occurs, a Spike is not immediately identiﬁable, for by deﬁnition
it  protrudes  head  and  shoulders  above  days  before  and  after  if  it  is  at  or
near a Top, and plunges much below the surrounding days if it occurs at a
Bottom. So after a day that exhibits an unusually wide range, the subsequent
days must be observed to discriminate the day from a Runaway Day. Both
are the marks of a far-ranging battle between bulls and bears, with the close
giving  a  clue  as  to  whom  the  eventual  winner  will  be.  The  importance  of
the spike is highlighted by

A. The strength and length of the action which preceded it
B. The close of the day, whether up on a Bottom or down on a Top
Its prominence when compared to the days before and after it
C.

An  extremely  wide-range  day  at  the  end  of  a  long  bull  move  which
closes down after making unusual new highs might even be construed as a
one-day signal. Whether one trades on it or not would depend on his par-
ticular style and taste and the nature of his trading — long range, scalping,
etc. In fact, the Spike might also be a One-Day Reversal — that pattern where
often an opening gap is followed by avid buying which collapses and closes
below the opening or at the low of the day. Such action might be compared
to an army pursuing a seemingly defeated enemy only to discover the retreat
was a ruse, then turning and ﬂeeing the other way in a rout.

know this is a blow-off and not a signal to pyramid? By the age, length, state, and

infrequent  that  a  Spike  will  be  followed  by  signiﬁcant  price  movement  in
the opposite direction. Figure 104.1 illustrates a modern Spike. Figures 1 and
35 show some spikes on Edwards’ and Magee’s charts.

Runaway Days

A Runaway Day is a day that stands out on the chart as having an unusually
long range, often opening at the low and closing at the high, or vice versa
for bear runaways. Here the enemy has retreated precipitously, or treacher-
ously  to  draw  the  bulls  into  a  trap.  The  holders  and  sellers  cannot  or  will
not  satisfy  the  eager  demand  of  the  buyers  and  so  the  price  transverses
perhaps two to three times the daily range. While the agile speculator may
jump on this charging train and realize a nice scalp, it is the following days
that reveal the true signiﬁcance. Nice consolidation and continued volume
will conﬁrm the day as signiﬁcant while a tapering of volume and rounding
or volatile pullback will call into question its validity. While these days may
be  taken  as  hair-trigger  buy  signals  (or  sell  signals,  depending)  the  return

See Figure 39 for runaways complete with gaps.

Figure 104.2 showing Microsoft in 2000 was one such example where a
bull trap precipitated by a Runaway Day with a subsequent collapse foretold
the 50% decline in Microsoft stock.

Key Reversal Days

The  Key  Reversal  Day  pattern  occurs  when  one  sees  a  new  high  in  an
upmove  and  then  a  close  below  the  close  of  the  previous  day. As  a  short-
term trading signal it has much to recommend it, but like every other tech-
nical pattern, judgment and timing are required to proﬁt from it. In a Bull
Market there will be some if not many such interim highs marked by Key
Reversal  Days.  On  the  Key  Reversal  Day  at  a  major  or  important  Top  the
trader  shorts  the  stock  on  the  close  with  a  stop  at  the  high  of  the  reversal
day, or slightly above. He may then exit on the proﬁt side on the occurrence
of a Key Reversal Day in the opposite direction, or on a proﬁt target, or a chart
pattern. Or he may, if adventurous, use the trade as the ﬁrst of accumulating
a  position  for  an  anticipated  Bear  Market,  adding  other  positions  as  more
signiﬁcant patterns occur and as support levels are broken.

This pattern also is useful in trading range markets, as shown in some
Internet  stocks  from  2000,  where  trading  with  Key  Reversal  Days  would

icant proﬁts.

Clearly these are the tactics of scalpers and speculators, but it does not

hurt the long-term investor to know and understand them.

from irrational volatility. The market knows things investors do not know. But it will
reveal these things to the most basic of investors if he reads the chart. This chart is

Consolidation Formations

An army, which has pushed forward too rapidly, penetrated far into enemy
territory, suffered casualties, and outrun its supplies, must halt eventually,
perhaps retreat a bit to a more easily defended position and dig in, bring up
replacements, and establish a strong base from which later to launch a new
attack. In the military parlance with which we have all become more or less
  one’s
familiar  these  past  few  years,  that  process  is  known  as 
gains. Although it will not do to overwork the analogy, there is much in the
action of the stock market which may be compared to a military campaign.
When a stock pushes ahead (up or down) too fast, it reaches a point where
the forces that produced its move are exhausted. Then it either reverses its
trend (in a Major or Intermediate sense), reacts to a good Support Level, or
Consolidates
 its position, in some sort of “sideways” chart pattern composed
of Minor Fluctuations, until it has caught up with itself, so to speak, and is
ready to go on again.

consolidating

We  already  have  had  occasion  to  refer  to  Consolidation  Formations  in
our study of Symmetrical Triangles and Rectangles. We saw how those two
chart  formations  might  either  reverse  the  previous  trend  or  Consolidate  it
in  preparation  for  its  continuation.  We  noted  that  about  three  out  of  four
Symmetrical Triangles will turn out to be Consolidations rather than Rever-
sals  —  and  Rectangles  in  about  the  same  proportion.  Even  a  Flat-Topped
Broadening Pattern, constructed at the Top of an Intermediate Advance, may,
despite its normally Bearish implications, be converted into a Consolidation
or  Continuation  Formation  if  its  Flat  Top  is  decisively  penetrated  on  the
upside.

A Dow Theory Line in the chart of one of the Averages may be either a
Consolidation  or  Reversal  Formation,  and  is  rather  more  likely  to  be  the
former  than  the  latter. A  Dow  Line  is,  of  course,  a  sort  of  loose  Rectangle.
The  fact  is  that  almost  any  sort  of  sideways  price  pattern,  such  as  is  often
termed  a  “Congestion”  or  trading  area,  provided  trading  volume  tends  to
diminish  during  its  construction  (and  provided  it  does  not  show  deﬁnite
broadening tendencies), usually functions as a Consolidation. But most areas
of  Trend  Consolidation  are  fairly  well  deﬁned,  taking  on  a  recognizable
pattern.

This is a typical and practically perfect Flag, constructed May 12 to
June  2,  1945,  in  Martin–Parry.  Daily  turnover  diminished  to  a  low  rate  as  prices
settled down for exactly 3 weeks after their swift advance from 11 to 16
, but held
up  away  from  the  lower  boundary  line  during  the  third  week,  and  then  burst  out
topside  with  high  volume  in  another  straight-line  push  from  15  to  21.  Study  this
chart again when you come to the Flag-measuring formula on page 192. The dashes
at 12 indicate the upper range of an old Resistance Level (Chapter 13).

Flags and Pennants

We do not need to spend more time here on the Triangles and Rectangles;
they have been examined in both their Reversal and Consolidation manifes-
tations in previous chapters. Our ﬁrst two formations, which are character-
, are the Flags and Pennants, and they are curiously
istic of Consolidation

Another typical Flag of 3 weeks’ duration, August 30 to September 18.
This National Gypsum chart overlaps that in Figure 49, showing the false move at
the apex of the May–June Symmetrical Triangle. A buy signal was given when prices
pushed  up  through  the  old  apex  level  on August  23  with  increased  volume.  Most
interesting is the second Symmetrical Triangle which formed in October–November,
an almost exact replica of the ﬁrst, but with a downside false move at its apex. The
sharp increase in volume on November 27 left no doubt as to its being a Consolidation
rather than Reversal Pattern. “NG” went on up to 33.

might be described as a small, compact parallelogram of price ﬂuctuations,
or  a  tilted  Rectangle  which  slopes  back  moderately  against  the  prevailing
trend. Let us consider the Uptrend Flag ﬁrst. It usually forms after a rapid
and  fairly  extensive  advance  which  produces  a  nearly  vertical,  or  at  least
quite steep price track on the charts. On such moves, volume normally shows
a progressive increase until it reaches a high rate. This volume (since every
transaction  signiﬁes  a  sale,  as  well  as  a  purchase)  is  a  warning,  of  course,
that many holders of the stock are taking proﬁts. Eventually the pressure of
proﬁt-taking halts the markup. Prices “churn” without further gain and then
react two or three points on reduced turnover. A new rally occurs, but fails
to equal the previous high or attain the previous top volume. Another reac-
tion  carries  quotations  slightly  below  the  preceding  Bottom  with  further
diminution of activity. Then follows a series of similar Minor Fluctuations,
each  of  whose  Tops  and  Bottoms  are  successively  a  triﬂe  lower  than  its
predecessor,  and  with  volume  shrinking  markedly  and  constantly  as  the

pattern  develops.  On  the  chart,  the  initial,  steep  up-move  followed  by  the
compact, sideways, and slightly down-sloping price Congestion Area, which
can  be  roughly  bounded,  top  and  bottom,  by  parallel  lines,  takes  on  the
appearance  of  a  mast  (or  halyard)  with  a  ﬂag  ﬂying  from  its  peak.  Hence,
of course, the name of the formation.

Sometimes  each  rally  and  setback  within  the  Flag  takes  3  or  4  days,
rarely more. In other cases, prices will skip back and forth between the upper
and lower Flag boundaries in a single day or two, in which event the pattern
on the chart consists of an almost solid block of price range lines. The wider
the  pattern  (from  top  to  bottom)  the  longer  time,  naturally,  it  should  take
for each swing within it to be completed. This process of Minor Fluctuations
may continue for only 5 days to a week if the Flag is narrow, or go on for
as much as 3 weeks. Daily turnover by that time usually will have shrunk
to  a  relatively  low  ebb.  Then  suddenly,  prices  will  erupt  with  a  new  burst
of activity from the end of the Flag and push straight up again in another
advance that practically duplicates the original “mast” atop which the Flag
was constructed.

We have spoken of the Flag pattern as being moderately down-slanting,
but the very short and “solid” ones will frequently develop horizontally and
look like small squares. (On rare occasions a pattern of the Flag type in an
uptrend will even slope up a triﬂe.)

is bounded by converging boundary lines rather than parallel. The normal
Pennant, in other words, is a small, compact, sloping Triangle. It slants down
when it appears in an uptrend, and up in a downtrend. It forms, as a rule,
after a rapid advance (or decline), and trading volume shrinks notably dur-
ing its construction. In fact, activity tends to diminish even more rapidly in
a  Pennant  than  in  a  Flag  (which  we  naturally  would  expect  on  account  of
the  progressively  shorter  ﬂuctuations  which  compose  it),  and  may  drop
almost  to  nothing  before  the  Pennant  is  completed  and  prices  break  away
from it in a new and rapid move.

The Pennant might also be described as a short, compact Wedge, char-
acterized by marked diminution of activity. When, as is usual, it slants back
against the preceding trend, its forecasting implications are similar to those

of the Wedge, in that prices break out of it in a direction opposite to its slant.
But there are rarer Minor variations of the Pennant, comparable with those
sometimes found in the Flag, in which the price area is very short and “solid”
and practically horizontal (like a Symmetrical Triangle), or in which the slope
is  actually  slightly  in  the  same  direction  as  the  preceding  trend  instead  of
against it. When prices move out of the last named type, they ordinarily do
so not in a sudden straight-line breakaway but rather in an accelerating curve
with volume increasing gradually instead of abruptly at the break. The whole
pattern then resembles a curved horn which runs to a long, slender point.
Don’t let these variations worry you; there is nothing deceptive about their
appearance; their kinship to the more common, normal form is quite apparent.

The Measuring Formula

The same approximate measuring formula applies to the Pennant as to the
Flag. They are both “Half-Mast” Patterns which ordinarily form after a fairly

FIGURE 111.
An example (in June 1944) of the very brief and compact type of price
“Congestion” which can be classed as a Flag. The advance here started at 5 from a
13-month Symmetrical Triangle of which only the last 2 months appear above. The
measuring implication (see below) of this tiny Flag was not fulﬁlled until after prices
had undergone a sort of Triangular Consolidation in July.

steady and rapid (steep) price movement. In applying the measuring rule,
go back to the beginning of that immediately preceding move, to the point
where it broke away from a previous Consolidation of Reversal Formation
(or  through  a  signiﬁcant  trendline  or  Resistance  Level,  with  which  later
chapters are concerned), a point recognizable as a rule by a quick spurt in
activity,  and  measure  from  there  to  the  Minor  Reversal  level  at  which  the
Flag or Pennant started to form. Then measure the same distance from the
point where prices break out of the Flag or Pennant, and in the same direc-
tion.  The  level  thus  arrived  at  is  the  minimum  expectation  of  this  type  of
Consolidation Pattern. As a matter of fact, advances from Flags or Pennants
in  an  uptrend  generally  go  farther  (in  terms  of  points  or  dollars)  than  the
preceding move, while declines may not carry quite so far. Hence, the for-
mula is best applied on a semilogarithmic chart by measuring actual chart
distance rather than by counting points. You can check this by referring to
the examples illustrating this study.

FIGURE 112.
Another example of the series of Flag-type Consolidations that may
form  in  a  rapid,  third-phase  Bull  Market Advance.  Mullins  went  from  15  to  above
39 in 6 months in 1936, dropped back to 31, and then rose again in March l, 1937, to
its previous high, making a Major Double Top. (“MNS” was split 2-for-1 in 1937.)

The July–August Flag ran for 5 weeks — too long to be trusted without additional
technical evidence (see point 3 on page 194). The danger in such prolonged forma-
tions is either that the breakout, when it ﬁnally appears, will fail to follow through,
or that prices will keep right on drifting down. For the moment — on August 25 —
it  looked  as  though  this  Flag  had  “gone  stale,”  but  when  prices  rose  above  the
previous high on August 27, with a smart pickup in volume, purchases were obvi-
ously safe.

Reliability of Flags and Pennants

These pretty little patterns of Consolidation are justly regarded as among the
most  dependable  of  chart  formations,  both  as  to  directional  and  measuring

indications. They do fail occasionally, but almost never without giving warn-
ing  before  the  pattern  itself  is  completed.  All  that  is  necessary  to  guard
against such failures is to strictly apply the tests as to authenticity of pattern
which we already have incorporated in their description. These are

1. The Consolidation (Flag or Pennant) should occur after a “straight-

line” move.

2. Activity should diminish appreciably and constantly during the pat-
tern’s construction, and continue to decline until prices break away
from it.

3. Prices should break away (in the expected direction) in not more than
4 weeks. A pattern of this type which extends beyond 3 weeks should
be watched with suspicion.

The  matter  of  practical  trading  on  these  particular  formations  will  be
taken up in the second section of this book, devoted to tactics. But our second
test deserves some further comment here. If a pattern begins to develop on
the chart which, so far as the price picture alone is concerned, qualiﬁes as a
Flag or Pennant, but during which trading volume remains high or obviously
irregular  instead  of  diminishing,  the  outcome  is  more  apt  to  be  a  quick
reaction  against,  rather  than  continuation  of,  the  previous  trend.  In  other
Minor
words, such high or irregular activity formations are characteristically 
Reversal Areas  rather  than  true  Consolidations.  Watch  the  volume  half  of
your chart at all times.

Where They May Be Expected

Flag and Pennant Consolidations are characteristic of fast moves. Therefore,
they show up most frequently in the later, dynamic phase of Bull Markets,
after the ﬁrst accumulation and the more orderly early markup stages have
passed. Hence, the appearance of these patterns may be taken as a warning
that an advance is approaching its ﬁnal weeks. The rapid phase of a Major
Bear  Trend,  on  the  other  hand,  is  its  second  stage,  often  characterized  by
almost  “vertical”  Panic  Declines.  The  Flags  and  Pennants  which  develop
therein are usually short — completed in a matter of 3 or 4 days rather than
weeks. In the late months of a Bear Market, formations that evolve on the
charts in the Flag or Pennant similitude often will run too long (4 weeks or
more), begin to show an increase in volume on the rallies, and be succeeded
by only dull and limited reactions.

In general, it may be said that these particular chart patterns are most
common (and most dependable) in uptrends. The appearance, 
 a Major
Decline, of price pictures which, at the start, assume the downtrend Flag or
Pennant  form  must  be  regarded  with  caution.  Unless  such  developments
hold  strictly  to  the  limitations  we  have  stated  above  under  the  heading  of
“reliability,” do not trade on them.

FIGURE 113.
The vertical lines marked “M” show how the measuring formula is
applied  to  a  Flag  Pattern.  Note  that  the  ﬁrst  measurement  is  taken  from  the  level
where  the  mast  leaves  the  previous  “Congestion”  up  to  the  peak  of  the  Flag.  This
same distance is then measured up from the Flag breakout. In “WYO,” the formula
worked  out  exactly.  Trading  commitments  should  normally  have  been  cashed  in
above  36  on  this  move.  They  might  then  have  been  reinstated  when  it  became
apparent by April 2 that a Rounding Bottom was completed (note volume) for a new
advance.

Flag Pictures on Weekly and Monthly Charts

One of our requisites for a dependable Flag (or Pennant) was that it should
not take more than 4 weeks to complete its pattern and break out in a new
move. It stands to reason, therefore, that a true Flag cannot show up at all
on a monthly chart and barely appears on a weekly chart. You will ﬁnd price
areas on long-range charts, patterns which have taken 8 or 10 weeks to as
many  months,  and  sometimes  a  year  or  two,  in  their  construction,  which
assume  the  shape  of  a  Flag,  but  do  not  expect  them  to  function  as  Flags.

prices have already gone low enough to suit their purposes. (They come out

develops  in  a  rising  market  will  take  the  form  of  a  Head-and-Shoulders
Bottom. Those that appear in decline assume the appearance of a Head-and-
Shoulders Top. By the time these price formations are completed (left shoul-
der, head and right shoulder evident), there is no question as to their impli-
cations. But at the head stage, before the right shoulder is constructed, there
may be — usually is — considerable doubt as to what is really going on.

The volume pattern in Consolidations of this type does not follow the
rule  for  Reversal  Head-and-Shoulders.  In  a  downtrend,  for  example,  the
Consolidation Formation resembled in its price contour a Head-and-Shoul-
ders Top, but the attendant volume will diminish instead of increase on the
left shoulder and head, as well as on the right shoulder. The same holds true

Typical of the form that Head-and-Shoulders Consolidation Patterns
may take, both as to price pattern and volume, was this development in Anaconda.
Measuring formula for the small Flag in October should be applied from the point
of breakout through the Head-and-Shoulders neckline.

market.  Breakouts,  however,  resemble  in  all  respects  those  arising  from
Reversal Formations.

Head-and-Shoulders  Consolidations  of  the  Complex  or  Multiple-type
very seldom appear on the charts. Theoretically, they might, of course, and
should be as easy for the chart technician to handle as the simple forms.

The formula for determining the probable minimum price move (beyond
the neckline) from a Head-and-Shoulders Reversal Formation was discussed
in Chapter 6. To anyone familiar with the verities of stock market trends and
the endless variety of pictures that the charts can present, it is amazing how
accurately that formula works out, how often the ﬁrst consequential move
away from a Head-and-Shoulders Top or Bottom will carry through to the
point (or a little beyond) implied by the measurement of the formation. But,
the same formula applied to Consolidation Patterns of the Head-and-Shoul-
ders form does not work out as well. Such patterns are usually quite “ﬂat,”
and  the  ensuing  move  generally  extends  well  beyond  the  measurement
implied  thereby,  while,  in  some  cases,  it  may  not  go  quite  as  far.  Conse-
quently,  the  Head-and-Shoulders  formula  cannot  be  applied  to  Consolida-
tion Areas with assurance that it sets up a deﬁnite and dependable objective;
one has to look, in these cases, to a variety of other chart indications in order
to appraise the probable proportions of the move to follow.

Scallops–Repeated Saucers

Our next chart picture differs from the Consolidation Formations previously
discussed, in that it does not constitute a more or less deﬁnite area of Con-
gestion  or  ﬂuctuation  to  which  one  or  more  critical  boundary  lines  can  be
afﬁxed. We could, perhaps, take it up as well in a subsequent chapter under
the general heading of normal trend action. Yet it is a pattern so characteristic
of certain types of stocks and certain types of markets, and so nearly related
to the principle of Consolidation for further advance, that it may better be
treated here.

When  a  stock  in  which  there  is  a  large  number  of  shares  outstanding,
and in which there is, at all times, a fairly active and “close” market emerges
from a long-time Bottom (as exempliﬁed by the past history of Radio Cor-
poration and Socony Vacuum), it will often make a long Major Advance in
a series of “Saucers.” These successive patterns, each of which resembles, in
both price and volume action, the Reversal Formation described in Chapter 7
as a Rounding Bottom, are slightly uptilted. That is, the rising end always
carries  price  a  little  higher  than  the  preceding  Top  at  the  beginning  of  the
Saucer. The net gain accomplished by each Saucering movement will vary
from stock to stock, but there seems to be a strong tendency for it to amount
to about 10 to l5% of the price of the issue. The total reaction from the left-
hand  lip  of  each  Saucer  to  its  Bottom  level  is  usually  a  little  greater,  from
20 to 30%. And the length (duration) of the Saucers is normally 5 to 7 weeks,
rarely  less  than  3.  Thus,  overall  advance  is  slow  but  steady,  in  much  the

same sense as the progress of the man who eventually got out of the deep
well by climbing three steps for each two that he slipped back.

The charts of stocks that take this sort of course show a picture of strikingly
similar and Symmetrical Rising Scallops, one succeeding another with little or
no pause between. Trading activity runs up to a peak at the latter stage of each
Scallop, as the previous high is approached and exceeded, then diminishes into
dullness as prices curve down and ﬂatten out at the Bottom of the next Saucer,
and picks up again as prices curve up into their next rise.

The trading opportunities afforded by stocks of the Saucering habit hardly
require extended comment (although we shall set down some detailed speci-
ﬁcations in the second section of this book). The Bottom level of each Scallop
is  usually  easy  to  detect  by  watching  price  trend  and  volume,  and  so  is  the
topping  out  at  the  end.  Yet  it  is  curiously  a  fact  that  most  “tape  watchers”
handle such stocks in the wrong way, becoming interested in them and buying
when they show activity (“make a new high on volume”) and neglecting them
entirely when they are in the dull, rounding-out stage of their trends.

look at the record before he buys on a ticker showing activity.)

As a stock with the Scalloping habit ﬁnally works up in price to 15 or
so,  its  pattern  tends  to  become  less  regular;  it  begins  to  depart  from  the
smooth, narrow Saucer-like curve of the lower levels. Above 20, it is apt to
break away entirely from the Scallop sequence and produce, from there on,
more  rapid  straight-line  advances,  interspersed  with  sharp  reactions  and
standard types of Consolidation Formations, which are characteristic at all
times  of  medium-  and  higher-priced  issues.  (There  are  exceptions:  Some
high-priced preferred stocks for which there is always a market, but whose
trends depend almost entirely on the gradual changes in prevailing interest
rates and supply of funds for investment, have a persistent Scallop habit in
their Primary Upswings.)

We have named rather speciﬁc price levels (15 and 20) in the preceding
paragraph, but price is not, of course, the sole factor determining the depar-
ture of a stock from a Scallop Trend. The only safe assumption is that, once
such a habit is detectable, it will be continued until the chart shows a deﬁnite
divergence  from  it,  and  such  divergence  usually  takes  ﬁrst  the  form  of  a
greater-than-wanted advance arising at the end of one of the Saucers. Con-
sequently, if you have previously taken a position in it at a favorable point
(near  the  Bottom  of  a  Scallop),  you  will  unlikely  be  hurt  when  the  stock
ﬁnally alters its action.

Chapter eleven: Consolidation Formations

Very  low-priced  issues  may  persist  in  a  Scalloping  Trend  right  up  to
their Major Bull Tops, and even attempt another Saucer Movement following
what  turns  out  to  have  been  the  ﬁnal  high,  which  attempt  then  fails,  of
course,  to  carry  out  the  previous  successively  higher  and  higher  pattern.
Such  failures  are  not  difﬁcult  to  detect;  the  change  from  previous  pattern
appears  before  any  appreciable  damage  is  done  to  a  properly  assumed
commitment.

Modern vs. Old-Style Markets

We have mentioned in our discussion of Reversal Formations that some of
them have appeared less frequently in the charts of the 1960s than they did
in prior years, and others more frequently. The same is true of Consolidation
Formations. Patterns of the compact, strictly deﬁned sort such as Rectangles
and Right Angle Triangles are less common now. Symmetrical Triangles are
apt to be somewhat looser than they were in the 1920s and 1930s — not as
clean-cut and conspicuous on the charts. Typical proﬁt-taking patterns such
as Flags and Pennants seem to be as common as ever, while “normal” trend
pictures, including those formations associated with normal trend development
(such as Head-and-Shoulders, Rounding Turns, etc.), are more common.

The  reasons  for  these  changes  are  fairly  apparent.  SEC  regulations,
higher  margin  requirements,  greater  public  sophistication,  and  a  more
conservative —  we  might  better  say  more  pessimistic  —  approach  to  the
problems of investment and stock trading generally have all played a part
in this evolution. SEC and Stock Exchange vigilance have done away with
the ﬂagrant pool manipulations designed to take advantage of the “lambs”
of former years. Nowadays, there is even very little of the more “legitimate”
sort of syndicate operation planned to facilitate large-scale accumulation or
distribution.

It  is  still  possible,  of  course,  for  “insiders”  to  hold  back  for  a  limited
time, or to prematurely release announcements of good or bad portent with
regard  to  the  affairs  of  a  particular  corporation,  in  order  to  serve  their
personal  strategic  purposes.  But  the  stock  purchase  and  sales  of  ofﬁcers,
directors, and principal owners are now too closely watched to allow a great
deal of “skullduggery.” (Nevertheless, the average investor had better still
be a triﬂe skeptical as to the probability of any great advance in the market
following publication of a good report.)

Collusion between investment advisory services and trading pools has
been effectively outlawed. (It is safe to say that it never did exist as ﬂagrantly,
even in the 1920s, as many amateur traders seem to think.) The SEC (with
the  thorough  cooperation  of  the  Stock  Exchange)  polices  the  investment
counsel  profession  thoroughly,  constantly,  and  most  effectively.  No  well-
established investment counsel can afford to indulge in deceptive or collu-
sive practices even if the desire were there. Most of them go far beyond the
most reasonable needs to safeguard themselves against any contacts which,
however innocent or useful, might be viewed with suspicion.

This chart shows the last 5 months of a broad, 13-month Saucer-like
Consolidation in “IT,” which followed its rapid run up from 3 to 16 in late 1943 and
early 1944. “IT” is an erratic actor, and its volume is apt to be particularly deceptive
in day-to-day movements. Major Price Patterns in it, however, are dependable. This
ﬁnal phase of its long Consolidation (distribution and reaccumulation) took ﬁrst the
form  of  a  Rectangle  (with  a  premature  breakout)  and  then  an Ascending  Triangle.
Its 1945–46 Bull Market Top was a massive Head-and-Shoulders.

There  are  times  when  a  Consolidation  Pattern  gives  the  only  good
technical signal that a Reversal in an issue’s Primary Trend has actually taken place.
Although cases of a Major Turn, particularly a Bottom, without some sort of recog-
nizable Reversal Formation on the chart are quite rare, they do occur. This weekly
chart of Flintkote illustrates such a phenomenon. A Bear Market low, from which it
rose  to  47  in  1946,  was  made  at  8
in  December  1941.  Without  developing  any
important  technical  foundation  on  either  a  daily  or  weekly  chart,  its  ﬁrst  upswing
took it to 11
the following April. From that point, it went into a 6-month Symmetrical
Triangle, and then broke out topside at the three-quarters stage on increased volume.
This action, plus the fact that it immediately thereafter burst up through an old and
highly signiﬁcant Resistance Level at 12, was sufﬁcient to mark it as being in at least
a strong Intermediate if not a full Primary Uptrend.

a Bear to Bull Trend is due.

Gaps

gap

,  in  the  language  of  the  chart  technician,  represents  a  price  range  at
A 
which  (at  the  time  it  occurred)  no  shares  changed  hands.  This  is  a  useful
concept to keep in mind, because it helps to explain some of their technical
consequences.

Gaps  on  daily  charts  are  produced  when  the  lowest  price  at  which  a
certain  stock  is  traded  on  any  one  day  is  higher  than  the  highest  price  at
which it was traded on the preceding day. When the ranges of any two such
days are plotted, they will not overlap or touch the same horizontal level on
the chart. There will be a price gap between them. For a gap to develop on
a weekly chart, it is necessary that the lowest price recorded at any time in
one  week  be  higher  than  the  highest  recorded  during  any  day  of  the  pre-
ceding week. This can happen, of course, and does, but for obvious reasons
not  as  often  as  daily  gaps.  Monthly  chart  gaps  are  rare  in  actively  traded
issues;  their  occurrence  is  conﬁned  almost  entirely  to  those  few  instances
where a Panic Decline commences just before the end of a month and con-
tinues through the ﬁrst part of the succeeding month.

Which Gaps Are Signiﬁcant?

From  the  earliest  days  of  stock  charting,  gaps  attracted  attention.  These
“holes” in the price trend graph were conspicuous. It was only natural that
observers  should  attach  importance  to  them,  should  try  to  assign  some
special signiﬁcance to their occurrence. But the result was unfortunate, for
there soon accumulated a welter of “rules” for their interpretation, some of
which have acquired an almost religious force and are cited by the superﬁcial
chart reader with little understanding as to why they work when they work
(and, of course, as is always the case with any superstition, an utter disregard
of  those  instances  where  they  don’t  work).  We  refer  to  this  situation  as
unfortunate  not  so  much  because  the  gap  “rules”  are  wrong,  but  rather
because their blind acceptance has barred the way to a real understanding
of a gap’s implications and the establishment of a more logical basis for its
uses in trading.

The  most  common  superstition  is  that  “a  gap  must  be  closed.”  Some-
times it is stated more cautiously in such words as: “If a gap isn’t closed in
three  days,  it  will  be  closed  in  three  weeks,  and  if  it  isn’t  closed  in  three
weeks, it will be closed in three months, etc.” There are numerous variations,

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

but they all add up to the belief that a gap must be closed, and that the trend
is not to be trusted until the gap has been covered. It is the latter inference
which leads to error.

Closing the Gap

But ﬁrst, what is meant by “closing” or “covering” a gap? Suppose a stock
in  an Advancing  Trend  moves  up  day  after  day,  from  20  to  21,  22,  23,  24,
and  closes  one  night  at  the  top  of  its  range  for  that  day,  at  25.  The  next
morning it opens at 26 and keeps right on moving up from there. This action
leaves a 1-point gap, between 25 and 26, on the chart. Then suppose the rise
continues  to  28,  halts  there  and  is  followed  by  a  reaction  in  the  course  of
which prices slip to 28, halts there and is followed by a reaction in the course
of  which  prices  slip  back  to  27,  26,  and  ﬁnally  to  25.  The  return  move  has
carried prices back through the gap area (25–26); the gap has thereby been
covered  or  closed.  In  brief,  a  gap  is  closed  when  a  subsequent  price  trend
comes back and retraces the range of the gap.

Must a gap be closed before prices move very far away from it? Certainly
not! Will it be closed eventually? Probably yes. If it is not closed by the next
Minor Reaction, there is a chance it will be covered by the next Intermediate
Retracement, and if not then, pretty surely by the next great Major Swing in
the opposite trend. But that may be years later — hardly a matter of interest
to the ordinary trader. The investor who bought Chesapeake and Ohio shares
at  260  on  October  21,  1929,  counting  on  the  closing  of  the  gap  which  that
issue had made on the preceding Friday, 2 points down from 266 to 264, had
 to get out even! Not until it neared the Top of the next
to wait nearly 
Major  Bull  Market  did  CO  attain  an  equivalent  market  value  (65,  since  it
was split 4-for-1 in 1930). In the meantime, he saw his investment shrink in
1932 to less than a sixth of his purchase price. As a matter of fact, there were
hundreds of gaps made in the charts of the 1929 to 1930 markets which never
have been covered since then, and many of them, it is safe to say, never will
be closed.

7 years

If  you  will  think  the  matter  over  for  a  moment,  you  will  see  that  the
probabilities we have stated above for a gap’s being closed apply just as well
to  a  stock’s  returning  to 
  price  range  at  which  it  has  once  been  traded,
gap or no gap.

any

Another  point:  there  are  thousands  of  price  gaps  made  in  trading  —
some of them quite wide — which do not appear at all on the standard daily
during
range charts because they are made 
 a single day and not between one
day’s closing and the next day’s opening. Such intraday gaps are ordinarily
overlooked entirely; the gap theorists are oblivious of them, although their
 gaps. Practically every
signiﬁcance is often greater than that of many 
emphatic  breakout  move  from  a  strictly  deﬁned  Rectangle  or  Right-Angle
Triangle is attended by a gap, but only those few show up on the charts that
occur at the day’s opening gong.

Continuation or Runaway class. Note that prices closed at or near the top on each

Also of interest in this chart is the Descending Triangle, which started to form in

because  we  want  our  readers  to  study  this  topic  with  an  open  mind,  free
from preconceived notions as to any mystic qualities which gaps may pos-
sess.  Turning  to  the  other  side  of  the  picture,  gaps  —  some  gaps  —  have
technical  import.  Some  gaps  are  useful  to  the  chart  analyst  in  appraising
trend possibilities. Let us see what we can make of them.

Ex-Dividend Gaps

mean anything. An eighth-point gap obviously has no technical signiﬁcance

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

as it represents only the minimum permitted change in price. By the same
token,  a  gap  of  a  quarter  of  a  point  or  even  a  half  point  in  a  high-priced
stock, such as Norfolk & Western (before the split), represents only a normal,
in  fact  close,  spread  between  successive  bids.  In  brief,  to  carry  interest  for
the  chart  technician,  a  gap  must  be  wider  than  the  usual  changes  in  price
that occur under normal or prevailing trading conditions. A second class of
gaps that have no forecasting implications are those formed consistently and
habitually  by  “thin”  issues  in  the  medium-  and  higher-price  brackets. You
can spot them easily. If your chart of a certain issue shows numerous gaps
as a regular thing, then no one of them is apt to mean anything special.

Finally,  gaps  that  appear  on  the  charts  when  a  stock  goes  ex-dividend
(whether the dividend be in cash, stock, rights, or warrants) possess no trend
implications. They are occasioned not by a change in the Supply–Demand
relation which governs the trend, but by a sudden and irreversible alteration
in the actual book value of the issue.

Eliminating the technically meaningless types named above, we are left
with  the  gaps  which  occur  infrequently  (and  which  are  not  occasioned  by
an  ex-dividend  change  in  value)  in  issues  that  are  so  closely  and  actively
traded as ordinarily to produce “solid” charts. A 1-point gap, for example,
in  the  chart  of  New  York  Central  would  be  an  unusual  event;  it  would
demand attention; it would presumably have some forecasting signiﬁcance.
Such  gaps,  for  the  purposes  of  our  study,  may  be  divided  into  four
classes: Common or Area Gaps, Breakout Gaps, Continuation or Runaway
Gaps, and Exhaustion Gaps.

The Common or Area Gap

This type of gap gets its name from its tendency to occur within a trading
area or Price Congestion Pattern. All of the Congestion Formations that we
have studied in the preceding chapters — both Reversal and Consolidation
types — are attended by a diminution in trading turnover. The more strictly
deﬁned sorts — the Triangles and Rectangles — show this characteristic most
conspicuously. Moreover, activity in these patterns tends to be concentrated
pretty much at or near the top and bottom edges, their Supply and Demand
Lines,  while  the  area  in  between  is  a  sort  of  “no-man’s  land.”  It  is  easy  to
see, therefore, why gaps develop frequently within such areas. You will ﬁnd
numbers  of  good  examples  of  Pattern  Gaps  in  the  charts  illustrating
Chapters 8 and 9.

Such Pattern Gaps are usually closed within a few days, and for obvious
reasons,  before  the  Congestion  Formation  in  which  they  have  appeared  is
completed and prices break away from it. But not always. Sometimes a gap
 traverse of prices across the pattern area just before
will develop in the 
a  breakout,  and  in  such  cases,  it  is  not  closed  for  a  long  time,  nor  is  there
any reason why it should be.

Chapter twelve: Gaps

215

The  forecasting  signiﬁcance  of  Common  or  Pattern  Gaps  is  practically
nil.  They  have  some  use  to  the  technician  simply  because  they  help  him
recognize  an Area  Pattern  —  that  is,  their  appearance  implies  that  a  Con-
gestion Formation is in process of construction. If, for example, a stock moves
up from 10 to 20, drops back to 17, and then returns to 20, making a gap in
the course of that rally, it is a fair assumption that further pattern develop-
ment will take place between approximately 17 and 20. This is a convenient
thing to know and may, on occasion, be turned to proﬁt in short-term trading
policy.

Pattern Gaps are more apt to develop in Consolidation than in Reversal
Formations. Thus, the appearance of many gaps within an evolving Rectan-
gle or Symmetrical Triangle reinforces the normal expectation that the pat-
tern in question will turn out to be a Consolidation rather than a Reversal
Area.

Breakaway Gaps

horizontal

completion

The Breakaway type of gap also appears in connection with a Price Conges-
tion Formation, but it develops at the 
 of the formation in the move
which breaks prices away. Any breakout through a 
 pattern bound-
ary, such as the Top of an Ascending Triangle, is likely to be attended by a
gap. In fact, it is safe to say that most of them are. And, if we consider what
goes on in the market to create a Flat-Topped Price Formation, it is easy to
see  why  Breakaway  Gaps  should  be  expected. An Ascending  Triangle,  for
example,  is  produced  by  persistent  demand  for  a  stock  meeting  a  large
supply of it for sale at a ﬁxed price. Suppose that supply is being distributed
at  40.  Other  holders  of  the  stock,  who  may  have  intended  originally  to
or  41,  see  quotations  come  up  to  40  time  after  time,  stop
liquidate  at  40
there  and  turn  back.  They  tend,  in  consequence,  either  to  join  the  crowd
selling  at  40,  or  else  to  ﬁgure  that  once  through  40,  prices  will  go  much
higher;  they  may  either  lower  or  raise  their  selling  price.  The  result  is  a
“vacuum” on the books, a dearth of offerings in the price range immediately
above the pattern. Hence, when the supply at 40 in our Ascending Triangle
example is ﬁnally all absorbed, the next buyer of the stock ﬁnds none offered
¼
at 40
and he has to bid up a point or more to get his shares, thus
creating a Breakaway Gap.

As we remarked earlier in this chapter, gaps of this type actually occur
on almost every decisive breakout from a Horizontal Congestion, although
many  of  them  do  not  show  on  the  charts  because  they  occur 
  a  day
and  not  between  one  day’s  close  and  the  following  day’s  opening.  Break-
away  Gaps  also  develop  at  times  when  prices  move  out  of  other  types  of
Reversal or Consolidation Formations; they are not uncommon in connection
with Head-and-Shoulders Patterns, for instance, and they even occur on the
penetration of trendlines, which we shall discuss in a subsequent chapter.

Gap, occurring as prices broke out of the complex base for the July–August Secondary
Recovery. (Compare this chart with Figure 32 on page 84.) Another type of Breakaway
Gap  —  through  a  trendline  —  occurred  on  August  26.  That  of  September  7  was
primarily due to the “ex-dividend,” while that of September 18 was still another type
of breakaway — through a Support Level.

The ﬁrst gap marked, on April 26, must be classiﬁed as a Runaway. It made a sort

of “Island” of the whole April/June complex base.

What forecasting value can we ascribe to them? First, they serve to call
attention to, and emphasize the fact of, a breakout. There can be little doubt
that a genuine breakout has eventuated when prices jump out of a pattern
with a conspicuous gap. False moves are seldom attended by gaps. Second,
they  carry  the  suggestion  that  the  buying  demand  (or  selling  pressure,  as
 than would be indicated
the case may be) that produced the gap is 
by a gapless breakout. Hence, it may be inferred that the ensuing move will
carry  prices  farther  or  faster,  or  both.  It  does  not  do  to  make  too  much  of
this point; it is a logical inference and one which has been borne out in the

Except  for  the  presumption  of  somewhat  greater  “steam”  behind  the
move, the Breakaway Gap carries no particular measuring implication, nor
any other forecasting signiﬁcance. The next question is: should we expect a
Breakaway  Gap  to  be  closed  within  a  relatively  short  time?  Or,  to  put  the
question in more practical and pragmatic terms: should we defer buying in
the expectation that it will be closed before any worthwhile move develops?
In order to give a fair answer to that question, it is necessary to scrutinize
closely the volume of transactions before 
 the gap. If a great many
sales were recorded at the takeoff level from which prices jumped the gap,
but relatively few as prices moved away from the far side of the gap, then
there  is  a  chance  —  perhaps  about  50–50  —  that  the  next  Minor  Reaction
will  carry  prices  back  to  the  edge  of  the  pattern  of  origin,  thus  ﬁlling  the
gap. On the other hand, if high volume developed at the 
 side of the gap,
and  a  great  many  transactions  took  place  there  as  prices  moved  on  away
from  the  gap,  then  the  chances  are  remote  that  any  near-term  Throwback
will  close  the  gap.  In  such  cases,  a  Throwback  reaction  is  almost  always
stopped at the 

 of the gap.

Keep an eye on the charts of the “Averages,” as well as the particular issues
in which you are interested.)

Where  Breakaway  Gaps  develop  intraday,  the  daily  chart  cannot,  of
course, indicate how the day’s volume was distributed. In that event, it may
be  necessary  to  examine  the  ticker  tape  or  ask  your  broker  to  refer  to  the
published record of individual transactions to which most brokerage ﬁrms

subscribe. 
EN9: Candlestick charts, now much in use, will allow the analyst to see the intraday
breakaway gap.
 Lacking any clear-cut volume clue, it is safest to ﬁgure that a
Breakaway Gap will not be ﬁlled until long after the full move implied by
the  pattern  of  origin  (usually  a  move  of  Intermediate  Extent  in  the  Dow
sense) has been carried out.

Continuation or Runaway Gaps

Less  frequent  in  their  appearance  than  either  of  the  two  forms  we  have
discussed above, gaps of the Continuation or Runaway type are of far greater
technical signiﬁcance because they afford a rough indication of the probable
extent of the move in which they occur. For that reason they have sometimes
been called “Measuring” Gaps.

Both  the  Common  or  Pattern  Gap  and  the  Breakout  Gap  develop  in
association with Price Formations of the Area or Congestion type, the former
within the formation and the latter as prices move out of it. The Runaway
Gap, on the other hand, as well as the Exhaustion Gap, which we will take
up  later,  is  not  associated  with  Area  Patterns,  but  occurs  in  the  course  of
rapid, straight-line advances or declines.

When a dynamic move starts from an area of accumulation, the upward
trend  of  prices  will  seem  often  to  gather  “steam,”  to  accelerate  for  a  few
days, perhaps a week or more, and then begin to lose momentum as supply
increases when the very extent of the advance invites more and more proﬁt-
taking.  Trading  volume  jumps  to  a  peak  on  the  initial  breakout,  tapers  off
somewhat in the middle of the advance, and then leaps up again to a terriﬁc
turnover as the move is ﬁnally halted. In such moves — and in rapid declines
of corresponding character — a wide gap is quite likely to appear at the time
when the Runaway is at its height, when quotations are moving most rapidly
and  easily  with  relation  to  the  volume  of  transactions.  That  period  comes
normally at just about the halfway point between the breakout which inau-
gurated the move and the Reversal Day or Congestion Pattern which calls
an end to it. Hence, a Continuation or Runaway Gap affords an approximate
prices
measurement  of  the  move  in  which  it  develops.  Its  inference  is  that 
will  go  as  much  farther  beyond  the  gap  as  they  already  have  gone  between
  the
beginning of the move and the gap, as measured directly (and vertically) on
the chart.

Since there is a tendency for advances to run, in terms of points, beyond
the  price  levels  arithmetically  implied  by  this  rule,  and  for  declines  to  be

FIGURE  126.
The  early  1946  daily  chart  of  Blaw–Knox  contained  a  number  of
interesting technical features. Its spurt from 19 to 25 in December 1945 was followed
by a 9-week Rectangle Consolidation, the end of which appears on the chart above.
Prices  erupted  from  this  Rectangle  on  February  11  with  a  typical  Breakaway  Gap.
Four days later, another gap appeared on even greater volume, and prices closed at
the top of the day’s range. This looked like a Runaway Gap, in which case continu-
ation to 32 was implied according to the “rule” stated below. (Note that the Rectangle
“measurement”  called  for  only  31.)  On  the  following  day,  however,  a  One-Day
Reversal, from 31 back to 30, appeared, and the next session closed the February 15
gap, which now had to be relabeled, tentatively, as an Exhaustion Gap (see page 219).
Prices  subsequently  dropped  back  to  the  support  of  the  9-week  Rectangle,  rallied
grudgingly along an established Intermediate Up Trendline, and broke that on April
24  to  return  again  to  the  25  support.  In  May,  another  advance  took  “BK”  up  once
more to 30, where it bumped against the previously broken trendline. That was its
last effort; in late July, the “valley” level at 25 was penetrated and a Major Double
Top had been completed.

To return to the February 15 gap, this is fairly typical of many cases in which it is
impossible  to  say  whether  Continuation  or  Exhaustion  is  being  signaled  until  2  or
3 days after the day the gap is made.

more  strictly  limited,  the  gap-measuring  rule  works  out  particularly  well
when applied directly on semilogarithmic scale charts. On arithmetic charts,
look for a triﬂe more on the upside and a triﬂe less on the downside. (In any
event, you will be wise to “bank” on something short of the theoretical goal.)
Runaway Gaps are easy to ﬁnd and identify in retrospect, but our task
is  to  recognize  them  as  such  at  the  time  they  appear.  Of  course,  there  is,
obviously, no danger of confusing them with Pattern or Breakout Gaps. With
those aside, any gap which shows up in a fast advance or decline 
 prices
have  moved  well  away  from  an Area  Formation  (or  the  penetration  of  an
important trendline or break through a potent Support or Resistance Level,
which we shall discuss later) may be a Runaway Gap. What then becomes

a gap was made, on March 3, on extraordinary volume. The next two days conﬁrmed
this  to  be  a  Runaway  or  Continuation  Gap.  As  such,  it  implied  further  advance

The measuring-gap rule should be used for purposes of “getting out” rather than
“getting  in.”  It  does  not  guarantee  that  a  move  will  continue  to  the  implied  limit,
but  it  does  give  assurance  that  the  move  is  near  an  end  when  the  rule  has  been
fulﬁlled.

Panic  Declines  often  produce  large  Runaway  Gaps.  The  September
7 gap in this chart, judged by its size, volume, subsequent action, and the fact that
it was made in “new low ground,” marked it as of the measuring type. Implied goal
was 26 or below. All other gaps in this chart were obviously of the “common” variety.

gaps  intervene  in  a  fast  move  and  are  evidently  all  classiﬁable  as  of  the
Continuation or Runaway breed. It doesn’t happen often, and is particularly
unlikely to appear in the chart of a fairly large and active issue, but one of
the thinner stocks in the midst of a “skyrocket” move may go skipping along
for 3 or 4 days making gaps between each successive pair. The only question
of practical importance that arises in such cases is: where should the halfway
measuring point be located? No quick and easy rule can be laid down, but
studious inspection of the chart, especially of the volume trend, will usually

afford an answer. Remember that halfway in these fast moves tends to come
at the stage where prices are moving most easily and rapidly with respect
to  number  of  transactions  recorded  (whence  the  tendency  to  gap).  If  there
  gaps,  the  halfway  stage  may  very  likely  have  been  reached  some-
are 
where between them. Inspect your chart carefully and try to “average” the
picture mentally; look for what appears to be the center of “thinness” and
use that for your measuring level. But remember also that each successive
gap brings the move inevitably nearer to Exhaustion, so let your judgment
lean to the conservative side; do not expect too much of the second or third
gap.

Exhaustion Gaps

The Breakout Gap signals the start of a move; the Runaway Gap marks its
rapid continuation at or near its halfway point; the Exhaustion Gap comes
at the end. The ﬁrst two of these are easily distinguished as to type by their
location with respect to the preceding price pattern, but the last is not always
immediately distinguishable from the second.

Exhaustion Gaps, like Runaway Gaps, are associated with rapid, exten-
sive advances or declines. We have described the Runaway type as the sort
that  occurs  in  the  midst  of  a  move  that  accelerates  to  high  velocity,  then
slows down again and ﬁnally stops as increasing Resistance overcomes its
momentum.  Sometimes,  however,  “skyrocket”  trends  evidence  no  such
gradual increase of Resistance as they proceed, showing no tendency to lose
momentum, but rather continue to speed up until, suddenly, they hit a stone
wall  of  supply  (or,  in  cases  of  a  decline,  demand)  and  are  brought  to  an
abrupt end by a day of terriﬁc trading volume. In such moves, a wide gap
may  appear  at  the  very  end,  i.e.,  between  the  next  to  the  last  and  the  last
day of the move. This gets the name of Exhaustion Gap because the trend
seems thereby to have exhausted itself in one ﬁnal leaping spurt.

The best test of whether a gap formed in a rapid, straight-line advance
or decline is of the Continuation or Exhaustion type comes on the day after
the gap (more precisely, the day which makes the gap), although there are
frequently  other  clues  in  the  preceding  chart  picture.  If  trading  activity
mounts to an extraordinary height during the session following the gap, and
particularly  if  the  previous  trend  in  prices  does  not  appear  to  be  carried
along at a pace commensurate with that day’s activity, the gap is probably
of  the  Exhaustion  class.  This  interpretation  is  reinforced,  in  fact,  made  a
virtual certainty, if the day after, the gap develops into a Reversal Day (as
described in Chapter 10) with the closing price registered back near the edge
of the gap.

Evidence  that  may  be  derived  from  the  chart  anteceding  the  gap  may
be enumerated as follows. If the trend has already carried out the full impli-
cations  of  the  price  formation  or  Congestion Area  from  which  it  emerged,
Exhaustion  is  more  likely  than  Continuation.  By  the  same  token,  if  the
reasonable measuring implications of the pattern of origin are still far short

The “skyrocket” run-up of Willys–Overland in June 1944 was marked
by  a  number  of  small  gaps.  The  ﬁrst  two  were  too  small  to  have  much  technical
signiﬁcance. The larger gap made June 16 was marked by the “stickiness” of prices
on that day as Exhaustion. A small Flag Consolidation ensued. The June 27 gap also
acted like an Exhaustion Gap insofar as price action was concerned, but volume had
declined instead of climbing to a new peak. On June 28, prices jumped away again,
so the June 27 gap was now marked as another Runaway with an implied objective
of 18
plus, which had already been reached. Note the Head-and-Shoulders Reversal
that then formed and subsequent Intermediate Reaction.

of attainment, the gap is probably of the Continuation type. An Exhaustion
Gap is seldom the ﬁrst gap in a runaway move; it is usually preceded by at
least  one  Continuation  Gap.  Thus,  you  may  ordinarily  assume  (unless  the
contrary appears from other and more weighty indications) that the ﬁrst gap

stage. (This, incidentally, upsets the common superstition that all gaps must

the Runaway Gap, it is not closed, but the trend moves right along never-
theless,  and  often  for  a  surprising  distance.  In  the  case  of  the  Exhaustion
Gap, the closing of it actually contributes to the signal that the trend has run
out.)

An  Exhaustion  Gap,  taken  by  itself,  should  not  be  read  as  a  sign  of
Reversal, nor even, necessarily, of Reversal at all. It calls “stop,” but the halt
is ordinarily followed by some sort of area pattern development which may,
in turn, lead to either Reversal or Continuation of the move prior to the gap.
However,  in  practically  every  case,  enough  of  a  Minor  Reaction  or  delay
ensues  from  the  formation  of  an  Exhaustion  Gap,  before  a  new  trend  is
established, to warrant closing out commitments at once. (One can always
reenter if it subsequently appears that the previous trend is to be resumed.)

The Island Reversal

We mentioned (at the end of Chapter 10) a Reversal Pattern, the Island, which
was to be taken up under the general study of gaps. The Island Pattern is
not  common,  and  it  is  not,  in  itself,  of  major  signiﬁcance,  in  the  sense  of
denoting a long-term Top or Bottom, but it does, as a rule, send prices back
for a complete retracement of the Minor Move which preceded it.

An Island Reversal might be described as a compact trading range sep-
arated  from  the  move  which  led  to  it  (and  which  was  usually  fast)  by  an
Exhaustion Gap, and from the move in the opposite direction which follows
it (and which is also equally fast, as a rule) by a Breakaway Gap. The trading
range may consist of only a single day, in which event it normally develops
as a One-Day Reversal, or it may be made up of from several days to a week
or so of Minor Fluctuations within a compact price zone. It is characterized,
as might be expected, by relatively high volume. The gaps at either end occur
at approximately the same level (they should overlap to some extent) so that
the  whole  area  stands  out  as  an  Island  on  the  chart,  isolated  by  the  gaps
from the rest of the price path.

We have said that an Island does not, of itself, appear as a 

 Reversal
Formation, but Islands frequently develop within the larger patterns at turn-
ing points of Primary or important Intermediate consequence, as for example
in the head of a dynamic Head-and-Shoulders Top. By the same token, they
appear occasionally at the extremes of the Minor Swings which compose a
Triangle or a Rectangle (in which event, of course, the gaps that set them off
are really better classiﬁed as Common or Pattern Gaps).

Major

The  reasons  why  Islands  can  and  do  develop  —  in  other  words,  why
gaps  can  and  do  repeat  at  the  same  price  level  —  will  be  more  apparent
when  we  take  up  the  general  subject  of  Support  and  Resistance  in  a  later
chapter. Sufﬁce it to repeat at this point that prices can move most rapidly
and  easily,  either  up  or  down,  through  a  range  where  little  or  no  stock
changed hands in the past, where, in other words, previous owners have no
“vested interest.”

FIGURE 133.
This Island Reversal Pattern at Bethlehem Steel’s Major Top in 1937
is  a  “classic,”  yet  it  was  followed  by  a  curious  and  disturbing  abnormality  in  the
strong rally that developed on March 30. Those who sold out on the Island’s signal
around 95 on March 19 or 20 were startled, and, if they had also sold short, justiﬁably
alarmed when prices jumped up a week later, not only through the second gap level,
but well above it. But eventually, as can be seen, everything worked out according
to the original forecast.

This incident will serve to illustrate a general principle: when a clear-cut technical
pattern of unquestionable signiﬁcance has been completed on your charts, do not let
some  apparently  contrary  development  that  occurs  shortly  thereafter  lead  you  to
forget or neglect the previous plain signal. Give such situations time to work out.

Figure 123  on  page  212  shows  the  sequel  to  the  above  chart  and,  incidentally,

another Island. Compare the volume.

Sometimes the second gap — the Breakaway that completes the Island —
is  closed  a  few  days  later  by  a  quick  Pullback  or  reaction.  More  often  it  is
not. Rarely, the ﬁrst gap — the Exhaustion Gap that starts the Island — is
covered  in  a  few  days  before  the  second  gap  appears,  in  which  event  the
Island Congestion takes on a sort of V-Shape (if it is a Top), and there is no

FIGURE 134.
This looked like an Island in “PA,” but the second gap was actually
attributable to a 50-cent dividend which went ex on November 20, and had, therefore,
to be discounted technically. Because of this dividend, it was necessary to lower the
Support Line at 40 (see Chapter 13) by half a point. That Support, therefore, was not
violated in December, and prices subsequently advanced to above 50 the following
March.

clear “open water” across the chart horizontally between the Island and the
trends preceding and following it. In any of these variations, however, the
interpretation remains the same: the preceding Minor Move should be prac-
tically retraced.

An Island Pattern is not easy to trade on, unless it be for a short-term
“scalp,”  as,  obviously,  a  good  share  of  the  retracement  may  already  have
been accomplished by the time the Island is charted and an order to buy or
sell  on  its  indications  can  be  executed.  Of  course,  if  the  entering  gap  is
recognized as an Exhaustion Gap, the trader who is interested in the stock
presumably  will  take  action  before  the  second  gap  forms  and  before  the
Island is in evidence. Perhaps, the greatest utility that Islands have for the
chart analyst is that of calling attention to a situation, of putting him on the
alert as to its potentialities.

Gaps in the Averages

Gaps appear also in nearly all Averages but, for obvious reasons, with rather
less frequency than in the charts of individual issues. While it is not necessary
for all of the stocks composing an average to make a gap simultaneously in

order to produce a gap in the Average ﬁgures, a majority of them must. As
might therefore be expected, Common or Pattern Gaps are particularly rare
in Average charts, but Breakaway and Runaway types are not uncommon,
although  small  as  compared  with  the  size  of  such  gaps  in  single  stocks.
Exhaustion Gaps, and, in consequence, Islands, again are rare. The conditions
that  create  an  Exhaustion  Gap  seldom  develop  in  a  sufﬁcient  number  of
individual issues at any one time to produce a counterpart in the Averages.
The technical interpretation of gaps in Averages is, in the main, the same
as in single stocks. The authors have not found that an Average gap possesses
any  peculiar  potency  or  signiﬁcance  over  and  above  that  attributable  to  a
gap in the chart of any actively and closely traded single issue.

Support and Resistance

The phenomena that we shall study in this chapter are markedly different
in kind from those discussed in preceding sections. We shall look now at the
stock  market  from  a  new  angle,  and  in  so  doing  may  ﬁnd  it  possible  to
develop some very practical additional rules to guide us in selecting stocks
for purchase or sale, in estimating their potential moves, in foreseeing where
they are likely to “run into trouble.” As a matter of fact, some experienced
traders have built their “systems” almost entirely on the principles of what
we  here  call  Support  and  Resistance,  paying  no  attention  to  the  speciﬁc
pictorial patterns of price and volume action we have been investigating in
preceding pages.

But Support and Resistance phenomena are not, by any means, unrelated
to the various patterns and formations previously studied. We have already
had  occasion  to  hint  at  a  basic  principle  of  Support  and  Resistance  in  our
explanation of gaps, and, as you read on, you will ﬁnd that a number of the
other  patterns  of  price  behavior  are  explained  thereby,  or  at  least  become
more readily understood.

Support

The term 

 is commonly used in the Street. In one or more of its
connotations, it must be fairly familiar to the reader. For example, we hear
that  such-and-such  a  crowd  is  supporting  XYZ  at  50,  or  is  prepared  to
support  the  market  by  buying  all  stock  offered  on  any  5-point  concession.
For the purposes of this chapter, we may deﬁne 
 as buying, actual or
potential,  sufﬁcient  in  volume  to  halt  a  downtrend  in  prices  for  an  appre-
ciable  period. 
  is  the  antithesis  of  Support;  it  is  selling,  actual  or
potential, sufﬁcient in volume to satisfy all bids and, hence, stop prices from
going higher for a time. Support and Resistance, as thus deﬁned, are nearly
but not quite synonymous with demand and supply, respectively.

Resistance

Support

A 

Support

 Level is a price level at which sufﬁcient demand for a stock
appears  to  hold  a  downtrend  temporarily  at  least,  and  possibly  reverse  it,
i.e., start prices moving up again. A 
 Zone, by the same token, is
a price level at which sufﬁcient supply of a stock is forthcoming to stop, and
possibly  turn  back,  its  uptrend.  There  is,  theoretically,  a  certain  amount  of
supply and a certain amount of demand at any given price level. (The relative
amount  of  each  will  vary  according  to  circumstances  and  determine  the
  of  demand,  and  a
trend.)  But  a  Support  Range  represents  a 
concentration
Resistance Range represents a 

concentration
 of supply.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

According to the foregoing deﬁnitions, you can see that the top boundary
of a Horizontal Congestion Pattern such as a Rectangle is a Resistance Level,
and its bottom edge a Support Level; the top line of an Ascending Triangle
is unmistakably a Resistance Level, etc. But we are more interested now in
anticipated
the reasons why Support or Resistance, as the case may be, can be 
to appear at certain price ranges. Within reasonable limits, and with a certain
few exceptions which we will examine later, it is quite possible to do this.
Expert chart readers are able frequently to make some amazingly accurate
predictions  as  to  where  an  advance  will  encounter  Resistance  (supply)  or
where a declining trend will meet Support.

The basis for such predictions — the elementary data from which Sup-
port  and  Resistance  theories  are  derived  —  is  that  turnover  in  any  given
issue  tends  to  be  concentrated  at  the  several  price  levels  where  a  large
number of shares changed hands in times past. Since any level at which a
great volume of transactions takes place usually becomes a Reversal point
(Major, Intermediate, or Minor) in that stock’s trend, it follows naturally that
Reversal Levels tend to “repeat.” But, here is the interesting and the impor-
tant fact which, curiously enough, many casual chart observers appear never
to grasp: these critical price levels constantly switch their roles from Support
to Resistance and from Resistance to Support. A former Top, once it has been
surpassed, becomes a Bottom zone in a subsequent downtrend; and an old
Bottom, once it has been penetrated, becomes a Top zone in a later advancing
phase.

Normal Trend Development

Perhaps  we  can  make  this  plainer  by  citing  a  typical  example  of  normal
trend  development.  Suppose  a  stock  in  a  Bull  Trend  moves  up  from  12  to
24, and there runs into a large volume of selling. The result is a reaction that
may take the form of a full Intermediate Correction to, say, 18, or a series of
Minor  Fluctuations  forming  a  Consolidation  Pattern  between,  say,  24  and
21,  the  effect  being  the  same  in  either  case.  Following  this  Correction  or
Consolidation, a new advance gets under way and carries price on up to 30
before  running  again  into  supply  in  sufﬁcient  concentration  to  stiﬂe  the
move. Now another reaction is evidently due. Again, it may take the form
of  a  sideways  Consolidation  Pattern  or  an  Intermediate  Correction.  If  the
latter, where will that corrective setback be reversed; where, in other words,
will  it  meet  Support?  The  answer  is  at  24,  the  level  of  the  ﬁrst  Top  in  the
trend.  That  is  the  level  (below  current  quotations)  where  a  large  turnover
had previously occurred. Then it functioned as Resistance, producing a halt
or Reversal in the ﬁrst upswing; now it functions as Support, stemming and
reversing, at least in a Minor sense, the latest downswing.

Why  should  this  be?  It  will  be  easier  to  suggest  an  answer  to  that
question  if  we  ﬁrst  go  on  with  a  similar  example  of  typical  action  in  a
downtrend. This time, suppose our stock makes a Major Top and declines
from, say, 70 to 50. There, at 50, a temporary Selling Climax occurs; there is

Resistance

a large turnover, prices rally, perhaps slip back for a “test” of 50, and then
stage a good recovery to 60. At 60, buying peters out, the trend rounds over,
turns down, and accelerates in renewed decline which carries to a new low
at 42. Again a wave of buying comes in, and a second recovery swing gets
under way. We can conﬁdently expect that this recovery (from 42) will run
Support
into strong Resistance at 50. The price level which functioned as a 
for the ﬁrst phase of decline, now that it has been broken through downside
  to  the
by  the  second  phase,  will  reverse  its  role  and  function  as 
second recovery move. The former Bottom level will now become a Top level.
Here, we may ask again why this should be so, and now we can suggest
an answer. In the example of downtrend action cited in the preceding para-
graph,  our  stock  ﬁrst  dropped  to  50,  ran  into  considerable  volume  there,
reversed its trend and rallied to 60 with activity dwindling on the rise. A lot
of shares changed hands at 50, and for every seller, there was, of course, a
buyer. A few of those buyers may have been covering short positions and,
having  done  so,  had  no  further  interest  in  the  issue.  Others,  short-term
traders and professionals, may have purchased simply because they sensed
a temporary Bottom in the making and hoped to scalp a few points on the
ensuing rally; presumably, they (or at least some of them) took their proﬁts
and were out before prices broke very far on the next decline But a majority
of  those  who  acquired  shares  at  50,  it  is  safe  to  say,  did  so  because  they
thought the stock was cheap at that price, because they ﬁgured it had gone
low enough. Only a few months ago, it was selling above 70; surely it was
a bargain at 50 and could be picked up and put away “for the long term.”

The Explanation

Imagine yourself, for the moment, in the place of those new owners. They
see  prices  turn  up,  reach  55,  58,  60.  Their  judgment  appears  to  have  been
vindicated. They hang on. Then the rally peters out, and prices start to drift
off  again,  slipping  to  57,  55,  52,  ﬁnally  50.  They  are  mildly  concerned  but
still  convinced  that  the  stock  is  a  bargain  at  that  price.  Probably  there  is
momentary hesitation in the decline at 50, and then prices break on down.
Brieﬂy, there is hope that the break is only a shakeout to be recovered quickly,
but that hope vanishes as the downtrend continues. Now our new owners
begin to worry. Something has gone wrong. When the stock gets down below
45, the former bargain doesn’t look so good. “Well, I guess I picked a lemon
that time, but I won’t take a loss in it. I’ll just wait until it gets back up to
50 some day where I can get out even (except for expenses), and then they
can have it.” (Does it sound familiar, by any chance?)

Take the opposite side of the picture — the uptrend process. You, along
with many others, bought XYZ at 12, carried it up to 24, decided that was
plenty  high  for  it,  and  cashed  in.  Thereupon  XYZ  reacted  to  20,  and  you
congratulate  yourself  on  your  astuteness.  But  then,  unexpectedly,  it  turns
around and rushes up to 30. Now you don’t feel so smart; that was a better
stock than you gave it credit for being. You wish you had it back. You will

Why  now  was  so  much  time  spent,  so  much  “work”  done  during
mid-1945  under  33–34?  We  cannot  see  it  on  this  chart,  but  the  previous  monthly
history shows that the Bottoms of long Congestion Areas were made in this zone in
late  1939  and  late  1940.  These  old  Bottoms,  representing  Support,  originally,  were
able  to  produce  some  supply  (Resistance)  5  years  later.  Once  prices  had  worked
through  that  supply,  however,  they  were  able  to  rise  quickly  to  44,  and  then  their
subsequent reaction found Support just where you might have expected — at 33–34.
Support had turned to Resistance and then to Support again.

We  can  skip  over  the  next  few  swings  which  “followed  the  rules”  and  go  on  to
the  change  in  the  picture  which  came  with  the  ﬁrst  notable  violation  of  a  Support
Level in 1946. Prices had pushed up the ﬁrst of February nearly to 54, well out above
the  Tops  around  46,  formed  the  previous  November.  The  late  February  reaction
should have “caught Support” around 46 — but it didn’t; it crashed on down to the
“round ﬁgure” 40. This was an ominous (although not necessarily “fatal”) develop-
ment. Thereafter, a massive Symmetrical Triangle was formed and broke downside
in September.

The ﬁrst Panic Decline in the Bear Market is no respecter of Support Levels. This
one was no exception, although it is noteworthy that prices “bounced” several times
from the important old 33–34 zone. By November, the Top Triangle’s measurement
had been exactly fulﬁlled.

You  should  turn  back  to  this  record  and  study  it  again  after  you  have  read  the

next 10 or 11 pages.

not pay more for it, but if it comes back down to 24, the price at which you
sold, you’ll “reinstate your position.”

Perhaps you have never been in either of these situations. Perhaps your
own reactions wouldn’t, in such cases, have been the same as those we have
indicated. But, if you have had a fair amount of experience in the market —
have some knowledge of the psychology of the “average investor” — you
know that the pictures we have described are typical.

At this point you may not be satisﬁed that we have succeeded in giving
an adequate explanation for our basic principle of Support and Resistance
Levels.  Remember,  however,  that  the  supply  and  demand  balance  in  the
market is nearly always a delicate thing. Only a moderate oversupply at any
one price will sufﬁce to stiﬂe an advance; only a little extra demand concen-
trated at a certain level will stem a decline. And remember, further, that other
traders  are  watching  the  tape  —  will  be  quick  to  sense  any  change  in  the
situation, and quick to join the parade whenever a change in trend appears
to be developing. Consequently, orders to buy or sell a few hundred shares
may induce the transfer of several thousand.

Another point worth bearing in mind is that the traders and investors
who  (because,  as  we  have  presumed,  of  their  previous  mistakes  in  either
selling  or  buying  prematurely)  created  Support  and  Resistance  Levels  are
not necessarily ignorant or inexperienced. On the contrary, we must list them
among the wiser and more alert of those who operate in the market. To make
one  more  use  of  our  previous  theoretical  example  of  typical  downtrend
action, those who bought at 50 were certainly smarter than those who bought
at the top (70) or on the way down to 50, even though the latter price was
broken  later  on.  Giving  them  credit  for  somewhat  superior  judgment,  it
follows  that  they  may  be  expected  to  appraise  later  developments  pretty
carefully and display something better than a wooden and stubborn deter-
mination to “get out even” when it comes to selling on a Recovery Move.
Hence,  in  a  marked  Bear  Trend  “overhanging  supply”;  i.e.,  stock  bought
at higher levels by holders now waiting for a good chance to unload, will
begin  to  come  on  the  market 
  the  theoretical  Resistance  Level.  Wise
owners will be willing to sacriﬁce a point or so to avoid getting caught in
a worse loss.

below

By  the  same  token,  “sold-out  Bulls,”  when  a  Major  Uptrend  is  under
way, may be willing to pay a point or two more in order to replace the shares
they had previously cashed in too soon. Thus, it is characteristic of reactions
in  well-established  (second  phase)  Bull  Markets  to  drop  back  only  to  the
very  uppermost  limits  of  a  Support  Range  —  and  for  recoveries  in  estab-
lished Bear Markets to reach only the lowest edges of Resistance Zones, or
perhaps even fail of that by an appreciable margin. We shall have more of
this sort of thing to point out later on, but ﬁrst we must take up two other
matters — how to estimate the potential importance of Support and Resis-
tance  Zones,  and  how  to  locate,  more  exactly,  the  centers  of  axes  of  such
zones.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Estimating Support–Resistance Potential

To go back to ﬁrst principles, we have seen that the Resistance that an upward
move may meet at any given level depends on the quantity of stock over-
hanging  there  —  the  number  of  shares  previously  bought  at  that  price  by
volume
owners who now would like to get out without loss. Obviously then, 
is our ﬁrst criterion in estimating the power of a Resistance Range. An old
Minor Bottom level at which only four or ﬁve hundred shares changed hands
cannot set up much Resistance to a subsequent advance, but a Selling Climax
Bottom  where  several  thousand  shares  were  bought  will  provide  a  lot  of
potential supply after prices, at some later date, have dropped well below
it, and then attempt to rise up through it again.

A long Rectangle or a Descending Triangle has a number of Bottoms at
the same level. We can get a crude approximation of the amount of Resistance
there  by  summing  up  the  volume  of  trading  on  all  its  Bottoms,  but  then
some discount must be taken for the shares that may have been bought at
the Bottom of the pattern in its early stages and then sold near the Top before
it was completed. In brief, a single, sharp, high-volume Bottom offers some-
what more Resistance than a series of Bottoms with the same volume spread
out in time and with intervening rallies.

Another  criterion  is  the  extent  of  the  subsequent  decline.  Or,  to  put  it
another way, how far prices will have to climb before they encounter the old
Bottom  zone  whose  Resistance  potential  we  are  attempting  to  appraise.
Generally  speaking,  the  greater  the  distance,  the  greater  the  Resistance.
Suppose PDQ sells off from 30 to 20, “churns” at that level for several days,
rallies to 24, and then drifts back down to 19. Investors who picked it up at
20 will not be greatly concerned at that stage. If a rally now develops from
19, there will be little or no disappointed selling at 20. Should prices dip
to 18 before the rally starts, there may be some supply forthcoming at 20,
but still not a formidable quantity. From 17, Resistance will become evident.
In brief, prices have to break far enough below the price at which a trader
bought  his  stock  to  convince  him  that  he  made  a  bad  investment  and,
hence, that he should sell when he gets a chance to do so without too great
a loss.

It is impossible to formulate any precise rule or equation to deﬁne how
far  a  decline  must  proceed  to  set  up  Resistance  above  it.  However,  do  not
look for much supply to come out of a Bottom level in the low-middle price
ranges (20 to 35) unless the trend later takes quotations more than 10% under
it.  This  10%  rule  cannot  be  applied  to  very  low-priced  issues. A  man  may
buy  a  stock  at  5  and  see  it  drop  to  4  or  3
with  considerable  equanimity
despite the fact that he stands a loss of 30% at the latter ﬁgure. His “dollar”
loss looks small, and he still thinks it will be easy for his stock to get back
up to 6 or 7; he is willing to wait.

½ 

Another factor enters into and reinforces the “extent of decline” criterion.
If our PDQ rallies, as before, from 20 to 24 and then drops rapidly to 12, not

level is the length of time that has elapsed since it was formed and the nature
of general market developments in the interim. You will, no doubt, ﬁnd it
reasonable to suppose that an Intermediate Bottom formed in the early stages
of a Bear Market will offer relatively little Resistance after prices have fallen
far below it, have taken perhaps the better part of a year to make a Major
base, and then have gradually climbed up to it again 4 or 5 years later. To
some small extent, this is true. A supply only a year or two old is apt to be
more effective than one that is 4 or 5 years old, but the latter does not lose
all of its potency by any means. In fact, it is often surprising how effective
the Resistance will be at a very old Bottom zone, provided it has not been
“attacked” in the interim, and provided no changes have been made in the
capitalization of the company which might obscure, in the mind of the owner,
the original cost of his stock. Under the latter heading, we would put split-
ups and large stock dividends, or even an unusually generous cash “melon.”

FIGURE 137.
For Major Support–Resistance Level study, monthly charts are most
useful. This one presents many points of interest. Observe how important levels are
formed and how, once formed, they appear again, and reverse their roles. The price
scale shows 1947 values with previous years adjusted for the splits of 1933 and 1946.

We do not mean to imply that an investor is ever actually deceived as to the
actual cost of his shares, no matter how they may have been split, or what
dividend distribution has been made, but his disappointment (and desire to
get out even) may be abated.

If, however, a Resistance Zone has once been attacked — if prices have
come  back  up  to  it,  hit  it,  and  then  retreated  —  some  of  its  power  has
obviously been removed. Some of its overhanging supply has been used up
in repelling the ﬁrst attack. The next advance, therefore, will have less stock
to absorb at that level. Here again, the volume chart may be looked to for
some approximation of the amount of Resistance consumed. In any event,
it  is  an  odds-on  assumption  that  a  third  attack  at  a  Resistance  Level  will
succeed in penetrating it.

Chapter thirteen: Support and Resistance

239

We  have  named  three  criteria  —  volume,  distance  away,  and  time
elapsed — to be used in assessing the amount of Resistance to be expected
at  any  given  level.  At  this  point,  it  must  be  apparent  to  the  reader  (and
perhaps  disappointing)  that  his  own  judgment  must  play  a  large  role  in
applying  them.  This  cannot  be  helped.  It  is  impossible  to  set  up  an  exact
mathematical formula for any of them.

But, after all, the problem is not too complicated. The general principles
are simple enough and, we believe, easy to understand. We can look back
at  the  charted  history  and  see  where,  in  the  last  preceding  downtrend,  a
Bottom formed that may produce more or less Resistance when the current
advance reaches back up to its range. We have to estimate how much supply
resides there, how many shares were bought originally at that price and are
still held by owners who may welcome a chance to get out even.

The  greatest  danger  in  applying  judgment  to  the  measuring  of  these
factors  lies  in  underestimating  the  amount  of  Resistance  to  be  expected.
Guard against that effort; it is safer always to overestimate it. You may be
Bullishly  disposed  yourself;  you  may  say,  “Those  fellows  who  were  hung
up there in this stock must realize that conditions have improved, and they
will not be so anxious now to sell.” Don’t count on it. Remember that they
have been “hung up” for a long time. Even if they are mildly Bullish on the
market  in  general,  they  may  be  so  disappointed  with  this  particular  stock
that they want to switch out of it and try something else. (The stubborn and
often costly refusal of the average American investor to “take a loss” operates
even against timely switching.)

Everything we have said in the foregoing paragraphs about estimating
potential Resistance applies as well — but in a reverse direction, of course —
to estimating potential Support. The principles are precisely the same, even
though the underlying rationale may be less easy to grasp.

Locating Precise Levels

Our next problem to consider is how, in practical day-to-day chart analysis,
we  can  locate  as  exactly  as  possible  the  limits  of  a  Support  or  Resistance
Range, and in many cases, the speciﬁc price ﬁgure representing the core or
axis of such a range. In the theoretical examples we have made up so far to
illustrate basic principles, we have used even ﬁgures, but in actual trading,
the levels are seldom so nicely marked. Even the sharp and relatively pat-
ternless  Bottom  of  a  Recession  may  consist  of  a  week  of  price  ﬂuctuations
within  a  narrow  range.  Perhaps  the  lowest  day  of  that  week’s  Congestion
will appear on the chart as a One-Day Reversal, or there will be 2 or 3 days
which “spike” down below the general mass. Here again, although no math-
ematical  rule  can  be  laid  down,  it  is  easy  to  relate  the  price  and  volume
patterns visually, and by simple inspection, arrive at a near estimate of the
ﬁgure at which supply in quantity is likely to be forthcoming. Look partic-
ularly  at  the  closing  levels  of  the  days  making  up  the  Bottom  Congestion,

Particularly noteworthy in this monthly record is the Resistance met

and average them mentally; this ﬁgure is apt to be pretty close to the “center
of gravity” of the entire Resistance Area.

Of course, some supply is likely to start coming in as soon as a subse-
quent advance reaches the bottommost fraction of the Resistance Zone, and
more and more will appear as the move pushes up into it. Sometimes, it is
possible to predict “to a hair” just how far prices will penetrate a Resistance
Range by carefully comparing the vigor (volume of trading) on the advance
with the volume registered at various levels in the original formation of the
Resistance.  This  takes  experience,  but  it  is  experience  which  you  will  ﬁnd
quite easy and not at all costly to gain. However, in most cases, it is neither
necessary nor particularly desirable to be so exacting.

Nearly  every  chart  in  this  book  shows  some  example  of  Support  and
Resistance phenomena, and the reader should make it a point, when he has
ﬁnished this chapter, to go back over them and study them all in detail. The
practical  application  of  the  rules  we  have  been  discussing  will  be  greatly

 You will undoubtedly be amazed to see how
Tops, Bottoms, and Sideways Congestions tend to form at the same approx-
imate levels in successive Major Swings, while prices move freely and rap-
idly,  up  or  down,  through  the  ranges  between  such  levels.  It  is  hardly
necessary to dwell on the practical dollars-and-cents value of such informa-
tion which may be derived from the chart history.

And  that  brings  up  a  matter  that  we  may  as  well  pause  to  consider
here — the kind of charts most useful for locating and appraising Support
and Resistance Levels. For near-term Minor Moves, the daily chart is natu-
rally  the  only  source  of  information,  and  a  daily  chart  record  that  extends
back for a year or more may, if necessary, be used in the location of levels
of Intermediate Trend importance. The writers have found, however, that a
daily chart does not give the perspective on the long range which one really
needs to determine Major and Intermediate Support and Resistance Zones.
It is apt to overemphasize the potential of a recently set up Minor Support
(or  Resistance)  Zone  and  obscure  the  importance  of  a  true  Intermediate
Level. For true perspective, a weekly chart, showing volume as well as price
ranges, and covering at least the whole previous Major Bull and Bear cycle,
is most desirable. Also, very good results can be obtained with a little study
and experience from monthly charts.

To  return  to  our  study  of  Support  phenomena,  we  have  had  several
occasions to refer in previous chapters to a “normal” trend. What we have
had in mind might perhaps be better called an “ideal” trend, since, like so
many other so-called normal things, it represents a pattern from which the
facts  of  experience  frequently  deviate.  In  stock  trends,  nevertheless,  this
normal  or  ideal  appears  as  a  fairly  common  pattern.  If  it  is  an  uptrend,  it
consists of a series of zigzags, each “zig” carrying prices to a new high and
each “zag” taking them back to the approximate top of the preceding “zig.”
To illustrate with ﬁgures, up to 10, back to 6, up to 15, back to 10, up to 20,
back to 15, up to 26, back to 20, etc. Such a move is what technicians refer
to as “self-correction” and regard as particularly sound and, hence, likely to
be  continued.  You  can  see  that  what  it  really  represents  is  reaction  to  the
nearest  Minor  Support  Level  following  each  step  forward.  If  you  become
interested  in  an  issue  with  such  a  trend  pattern,  the  normal  return  to  a
Support produces a good place to buy.

Signiﬁcance of Support Failure

Sooner or later, however, a normal Minor Wave Pattern is bound to be broken
up. This generally occurs in one of two ways (although there is an inﬁnity
of  possible  variations).  In  one,  prices  spurt  away  in  an  advance  out  of  all
proportion to the previous succession of up waves. Such a move is seldom

The other type of disruption appears when a reaction does 

 halt and
reverse  at  the  level  of  the  previous  Minor  Top,  but  sifts  on  down  through
that  zone,  perhaps  to  the  level  of  the  preceding  Minor  Bottom.  This  move
has “broken its Support,” and any such action carries a distinct warning of
a change in trend, a particularly emphatic warning if activity shows a ten-
change
dency to increase as or after the Support is violated. Note that we said 
in trend rather than Reversal, since the puncturing of a Minor Support Level
may signify only a halt for sideways Consolidation. But it may also foretoken
an impending Reversal. Either of these is a change.

If you will now call to mind the picture of a typical Head-and-Shoulders
Top, you will see that the decline from the head constitutes just such a break
in  Minor  Support  since  it  comes  down  through  the  level  of  the  top  of  the
left shoulder, and you will recall that this decline is often the ﬁrst intimation
we have that something in the nature of a Reversal Formation is developing.
Thus, even the violation of a nearby Support Level has a practical mean-
ing  in  technical  chart  analysis.  The  breaking  of  a  Minor  Support  should
always be regarded as the ﬁrst step in the Reversal of the Intermediate Trend.
(If it turns out to be Consolidation only, there will be an opportunity later
to  reenter  an  abandoned  commitment  if  desired.)  By  the  same  token,  the
breaking  of  an 
  Support  Range  is  frequently  the  ﬁrst  sign  of  a
Reversal  in  the 
  Trend.  We  do  not  believe  it  is  necessary  to  expatiate
further  on  this  principle.  Recommended  trading  tactics  based  thereon  are
discussed in the second part of this book; Support and Resistance Levels are
particularly useful as basing points for stop-loss orders which are discussed
there.

When prices broke down out of the large Descending Triangle which

at least temporarily, around 37 at the level of the 4-week Congestion made in April,

Popular Misconceptions

The reader will understand, of course, that all we have said here about the
breaking of Supports applies, as well, but in reverse direction, to the pene-
tration of Resistance Levels. One more point may well be mentioned before
we leave this subject. If you happen to have spent much time in boardrooms,
you will have noticed that the concepts of Support and Resistance that are
prevalent there are somewhat different from those outlined in this chapter.
For example, if X has advanced to 62, reacted to 57, then pushed on to 68,
many  traders  will  speak  of  57  as  being  the  Support  Level,  presumably
because  that  was  the  last  price  at  which  X  was  supported  in  sufﬁcient
strength to turn its trend from down to up. We, however, as you have seen,
would  name  the  vicinity  of  62  as  the  Support  Range.  The  distinction  is
important to grasp, and sometimes extremely important in practical results.
Admittedly, it does not come easy to think of a former Top as denoting
the level at which a later Bottom should form, or vice versa; it would seem
superﬁcially  to  be  much  more  logical  to  relate  Top  to  Top  and  Bottom  to

Bottom. Moreover, it is perfectly true, to use our X example again, that some
of  the  investors  who  wanted  to  buy  it  at  57 might  not  have  succeeded  in
getting it before the second advance to 68 took it away, and that their buy
orders  might  still  stand  at  57  or  might  be  reentered  on  any  return  to  that
price. Nevertheless, there is certainly no assurance that such is the case; there
is  no  “vested  interest”  in  X  at  57  that  will  “automatically”  bring  in  new
buying. On the other hand, we have seen how there is a sort of vested interest
set  up  at  an  old  Bottom  which  produces  selling  (Resistance),  and  thereby
creates a new Top, and at an old Top which produces buying (Support) and
thereby creates a new Bottom.

The  reader  is  urged  to  keep  this  concept  well  in  mind. Any  analytical
study of the chart records will quickly show that it is much easier for prices
to push up through a former Top level than through the Resistance set up
at  a  previous  volume  Bottom  (and  vice  versa,  of  course,  with  respect  to
declines). You will ﬁnd that a little selling may come in at a former high, but
usually only enough to cause a brief halt rather than the more or less exten-
sive  reactions  or  Consolidations  that  develop  when  the  trend  comes  up
against a real Resistance Zone.

FIGURE 142.
The February reaction in Figure 141 met momentary Support at 24;
prices bounced far enough to close the February 7 gap, and then broke down through
the Rectangle Top-Line Support — technically a distinct warning. Then a Symmetrical
Triangle formed, but the breakout came too near the apex, produced only a rally to
the  former  high,  and  then  an  “end  run.”  One  did  not  need  to  wait  for  the  Double
Top signal on August 22 to forecast a decline of more than Minor consequence.

The Round Figures
There are certain other levels that may, at times, evidently produce consid-
erable  Resistance  or  Support  without  any  reference  to  a  previous  “vested
interest.”  We  have  in  mind  the  “round”  Figures 20,  30,  50,  75,  100,  etc.  In
setting a goal for taking proﬁts when we buy a stock, it is natural for us to
think  in  terms  of  such  round  prices.  If  a  low-priced  stock  has  advanced
steadily  from  around  10,  it  is  pretty  certain  on  this  account  to  meet  with
especially if that ﬁgure represents a new high for it for
proﬁt-taking sales at 20, 
several years
. In fact, any time an issue gets out into new all-time high ground,
where there is nothing in its chart history to indicate otherwise, it is a fairly
safe bet that Resistance will appear at the round ﬁgures. In old and actively
traded  stocks,  such  as  U.S.  Steel 
,  the  round  ﬁgures
diminish in importance.

exactly  the  same  ranges  year  after  year  in  one  Bull  and  Bear  cycle  after
another. As a matter of fact, there is a well-marked tendency for this to occur
in old-line, actively traded stock. In General Electric, for example, the 22–24,
34–35,  40–42,  and  48–50  zones  have  been  characterized  by  large  turnover
(and,  consequently,  by  many  Intermediate  Reversals  of  trend),  throughout
the  1920s  to  1950s.  In  Southern  Paciﬁc,  there  are  historical  Support  and
Resistance  Zones  at  21–22,  28–30,  38–40,  and  55–56.  In  U.S.  Steel,  42–45,

are dead or transmogriﬁed the principle is alive and well.

Over long periods, however, such Support and Resistance Levels do tend
to  be  gradually  modiﬁed,  broadened,  or  “blurred,”  and  new  ones  created.
One source of many important new Supply Zones is a Bear Market Panic.
For  this  is  the  one  type  of  decline  that  can  be  counted  on  to  pay  no  heed
whatever to previous underlying Support Zones. Panics (which, as we have
seen in our earlier study of Primary Swings in connection with Dow Theory,
typify the second phase of Bear Markets), once they get under way, seem to
sweep  away  all  potential  Support  in  their  calamitous  plunges  until  they
exhaust themselves in a general market Selling Climax. And that climax may
or  may  not  come  at  a  level  that  bears  a  relation  to  some  previously  estab-
lished Support. To use U.S. Steel again as an example, the 1937 Panic Decline
took the stock down through its 93–96 range, hesitated brieﬂy at the 78–80
level, and then plunged through 69–72 and 55–58 to stop just above 50. In
the 1946 Panic, X again broke swiftly through 78–80 and 69–72 to halt at 66.
When there is a large turnover at a Panic Bottom in any given stock, that
level  acquires  a  strong  “vested  interest”  for  the  future,  and  will  usually
furnish conspicuous Resistance to a subsequent advance (after another Bear
Market Decline has taken quotations below the Panic Level).

This discussion of Panics brings us back to a consideration of Support
and Resistance performance at other stages of the Primary Trend — a matter
on which we stated early in this chapter we should have more to say. Bearing
in mind the relation of Resistance to volume, it is easy to see why in a long
drawn  out,  but  otherwise  typical  Bear  Swing,  in  which  trading  interest
diminishes to a very low ebb as the ﬁnal low is approached, the next to the
last  Intermediate  Bottom  may  produce  relatively  little  supply,  and  conse-
quently, only a small reaction when the new uptrend reaches its level. Add
to this the fact that many of the buyers in the last stages of a Major Decline
are  deliberate  scale-down  investors  who  fully  expect  prices  will  go  lower
and, hence, are not easily shaken out. The slow progress so often seen in the
ﬁrst  part  of  a  new  Primary  Bull  Market  is  due  not  so  much  to  overhead
Resistance as to lack of impatient public bidding.

The Recovery Trends that follow precipitous Bear Market Panics usually
exhaust themselves, for obvious reasons, long before they get back up to the
last Resistance Level left behind in that Primary Downswing (which is usu-
ally the Bottom of the ﬁrst Intermediate Decline from the extreme Top of the

. Look way back on your charts, therefore, when sizing

A  further  thought  along  that  line  is:  there  is  no  law  that  requires  an
advancing trend to keep right on climbing until it reaches a distant overhead
Supply Zone. It is true, as a corollary which we have already mentioned to
our Support and Resistance Theory, that prices can and do rise easily through
a price range where no Bottoms or Congestion Areas have formed in previ-
ous downtrends, but if the ﬁrst established Resistance Level is a long ways
may
above, the advance may exhaust itself before it gets there. Heavy supply 
come in for other reasons at a lower level. Think, then, of a distant Resistance
Level  as  a  maximum  possibility  rather  than  as  a  certain  goal.  However,
between two stocks whose purchase you are considering, you should select
the one which, other things being equal, has the “thinner” track overhead,
can rise farther before it encounters a charted Supply Zone.

Pattern Resistance

We can revert now to some of the Minor phenomena discussed in connection
with Reversal and Consolidation Patterns in earlier chapters. Take gaps, for
instance.  You  will  now  see  why  it  is  easy  and,  hence,  quite  in  order  for  a
reaction that comes soon after a gap has been made to slip back and close
that gap. There is no “vested interest” whatever in the range through which
prices skipped to form the gap on the chart. You will also see why such a
provided
reaction may stop short and reverse as soon as it has closed the gap, 
there was a high-volume turnover in the price range immediately preceding
the gap. Such is usually the case with a Breakaway Gap.

Any gap, for the same reason, is easy to close once a reaction starts prices
moving  back  in  that  direction,  if  it  is  not  too  far  away  and  if  there  are  no
intervening Resistance Levels to stop the reaction before it gets there. In the
case of a Runaway Gap, however, there is no reason why a reaction should
halt as soon as it has covered the gap range; on the contrary, it will probably
continue on through the “thin” price track that preceded the gap.

Pullbacks and Throwbacks — the quick return moves which we noted
as developing so often shortly after a breakout from a Head-and-Shoulders
or other Area Pattern — exemplify the principles of Support and Resistance.
When  prices  break  down,  for  example,  out  of  a  Descending  Triangle,  the
horizontal lower boundary of the formation, which was originally a Demand
Line, promptly reverses its role and becomes a Resistance Level. Any attempt
to  put  prices  back  up  through  it,  therefore,  after  a  decisive  breakout,  is
stopped by supply at or near the line. By the same token, the neckline of a
Head-and-Shoulders Top, which was a Demand Line, becomes a Resistance
Level after it has been broken. The Top or Supply Line of a Rectangle becomes
a  Support  after  prices  have  pushed  above  it  on  volume  and  by  a  decisive
margin.

We ﬁrst discussed Pullbacks in connection with the Head-and-Shoul-
ders in Chapter 6 and refer to them again in this chapter (page 243) as Support–Re-
sistance phenomena. At least one Pullback to the neckline (after the breakout) occurs
in the great majority of cases. Many Head-and-Shoulders Formations produce two,
the ﬁrst within a few days after the breakout and before prices have gotten very far
away,  and  the  second  weeks  later,  sometimes  after  the  minimum  measurement  of
the  Head-and-Shoulders  has  been  fulﬁlled.  Goodyear  saw  the  unusual  number  of
four Pullbacks to its 1946 neckline — the ﬁrst two weeks after the August breakout,
another in October, a third in November, and a fourth in February 1947, which met
the Double Resistance of the neckline and the down trendline (Chapter 14) projected
from the 1946 April head and August right shoulder.

Earlier in this chapter, in our discussion of the three criteria for apprais-
ing  the  amount  of  Resistance  to  be  expected  at  a  former  Bottom  level,  we
named  “distance  away”  as  one  of  them  and  stated  as  a  general  rule  that
prices should have gone at least 10% beyond that level in a medium-priced
stock before much Resistance would be set up. This 10%-away rule does not
apply, however, in the case of a Throwback to a well-deﬁned area formation,
when  it  follows  shortly  after  a  breakout. All  that  is  necessary  to  establish
strong  Resistance  to  such  moves  at  the  pattern  boundary  is  a  conclusive
breakout.

The Symmetrical Triangle has a different sort of Support and Resistance
“ﬁeld.”  You  will  recall  that  the  ﬁrst  Reversal  point  in  the  formation  of  a
Symmetrical Triangle (a Top, if it forms on a rising trend, or a Bottom if on
a decline) is normally accompanied by high trading volume, but that activity

Several examples of the support “ﬁeld” of the Symmetrical Triangle
appear  in  this  1945  daily  chart  of  “IT.”  Following  the  belated  February  5  breakout
from the ﬁrst Triangle, prices returned on the 9th to the level of the mid-January Top,
but  then  suffered  a  more  extensive  reaction,  which  came  down  on  February  26  to
the Triangle’s apex level. This was a critical juncture. The apex point itself is a strong
Support (or Resistance), but its level becomes weaker as time passes. In this case an
“end run” might have been developing. Stop-loss orders should always be entered
under an apex level (see Chapter 27). Here the apex held, however, and prices went
into  another  “Coil,”  breaking  out  topside  on  March  10.  Their  next  reaction  was
supported, as was to be expected after an early breakout like this, at the Top Pattern
Line.

The price track from mid-March to the end of April fell into an Ascending Triangle
Pattern, the top boundary of which functioned as Support in June but was broken
in July. Refer back to Figure 120, page 204.

diminishes rapidly on succeeding ﬂuctuations within its converging bound-
aries.  Consequently,  once  prices  have  broken  out  of  the  Triangle  and  have
proceeded  well  beyond  the  level  of  the  pattern’s  ﬁrst  Reversal  point,  that
level, because of the volume of shares traded there, becomes a Support (or
Resistance)  against  a  subsequent  reaction.  But,  if  the  breakout  move  does
not carry beyond the Triangle’s ﬁrst Reversal Level by a clear margin, any
Throwback  will  probably  bring  quotations  back  to  the  extended  (sloping)
pattern  boundary,  and  if  the  reaction  does  not  occur  until  the  trend  has
worked  out  to  or  beyond  the  Triangle’s  apex,  then  the  Throwback  usually
will not meet Support (or Resistance) until it has carried back to the level of
the apex. The apex, in brief, represents the concentration level or 
 of the
Triangle’s Support and Resistance.

FIGURE 145.
In this instance, a belated upside breakout (August 10) from a Sym-
metrical Triangle failed quickly and the subsequent reaction, after holding for several
days at the apex level, ﬁnally broke down for an “end run.” Thereafter, note that the
apex level turned into a Resistance against Recovery Moves.

The intersection of the two converting boundary lines of a Symmetrical
Triangle has sometimes been called a “cradle.” The axis Support (or Resis-
tance)  is  strongest  near  the  cradle  point  and  gets  weaker  as  the  axis  line
(apex  level)  is  extended  out  to  the  right  on  the  chart  (i.e.,  as  time  passes).
Thus, if a late breakout move fails to carry prices very far from the Triangle

area,  and  the  trend  then  peters  out,  ﬂattens,  and  begins  to  react 
cradle  point  has  been  passed  in  terms  of  time,  its  action,  as  it  reaches  the
axis line, must be closely watched. (A stop-loss order may be indicated here.)
Should the axis Support fail to hold, the reaction may plunge through and
accelerate in a more extensive swing, which has aptly been termed an “end
run around the line.”

Volume on Breaks Through Support

On those occasions when prices fail to retreat when they hit a Resistance (or
Support) Range, but, after perhaps holding there for several days, push on
through, there is nearly always a sudden acceleration and a marked pickup
in volume. This may be taken as conﬁrmatory evidence of a decisive break
and,  consequently,  an  indication  that  the  move  will  carry  on.  The  reasons
for this volume increase are obscure. Some say, “It takes volume to overcome
Resistance,”  which  is  true  enough,  but  the  volume  usually  comes 
  the
Resistance  has  been  penetrated.  Therefore,  others  say,  “The  volume  is  evi-
dence that technicians see what has happened and are now jumping in.” But
that line of thought, in the authors’ opinions, also has little to substantiate
it. (We shall have more to say about the questionable inﬂuence of technicians
on the trend later on.) Many of the arguments over volume change vs. price

Here  is  a  typical  case  of  two  Pullbacks  to  a  Head-and-Shoulders
neckline, the ﬁrst immediately after the breakout and the second 3 weeks later. Note
that the initial breakthrough “bounced” from the early April Top Support, and the
late July decline met Support at the general April–May Congestion Area. But what

change  savor  of  the  old  hen-or-egg  riddle.  In  any  event,  causes  for  many
technical  phenomena,  such  as  this  one,  may  be  left  to  the  academicians,
provided the practical implications are clear.

Support and Resistance in the Averages

As has been the case with nearly every other technical phenomenon we have
studied, the principles of Support and Resistance apply, with suitable allow-
ances, to Averages as well as to individual stocks. Since an Average reﬂects
the combined charts of the majority of the issues that compose it, but with
a minority of them frequently evincing quite divergent patterns, it follows
naturally  that  Support  and  Resistance  Zones  in  the Averages  cannot  be  as
sharply and narrowly construed. Minor Tops and Bottoms in the Averages,
particularly,  are  less  dependable  as  Resistance  Levels.  Clearly  deﬁned  and

important Intermediate Reversals, however, since they nearly always repre-
sent  Reversals  in  the  entire  market  (practically  all  stocks),  will  normally
produce strong Resistance (or Support, as the case may be) in the subsequent
Average Trend.

When  the  Averages  break  down  through  a  Support  Level,  but  one  or
more  stocks,  at  the  same  time,  hold  ﬁrm  at  or  above  their  corresponding
individual Supports, there is a presumption that those particular stocks are
in  a  stronger  position  than  others  to  participate  in  the  next  recovery.  The
phrase “other things being equal” should be added, however, for there are
qualiﬁcations to this presumption which must be considered. For instance,
it may be that the stock that has resisted decline will, for that very reason,
be  less  attractive  to  new  buyers  than  one  which  broke  drastically  and  is,
therefore, now purchasable at a more “attractive” price.

Many of the claims made regarding future prospects for stocks that have,
by  one  criterion  or  other,  previously  evinced  “better-than-Average”  or
“worse-than-Average” market performance permit argument either way. It
is safest to treat all such relative performance indications as only one minor
factor to be appraised in the overall chart picture.

Trendlines and Channels

One  of  our  basic  tenets  in  this  system  of  technical  stock  chart  analysis  —
indeed, a fact which any neophyte can quickly verify for himself by inspec-
prices
tion of the market records for whatever period he chooses — is that 
move in trends
. The market in general, and the many stocks which compose
it,  do  not  jump  up  and  down  in  an  altogether  random  fashion;  on  the
contrary, they show deﬁnite organization and pattern in their charted course.
Prices move in trends. These trends may be either up or down or side-
ways  (horizontal).  They  may  be  brief  or  of  long  duration.  They  may  be
classiﬁed as Major (Primary), Intermediate (Secondary), or Minor, according
to the rules of Dow Theory, or as Horizontal Line Formations. (The distinc-
tion  between  a  short  Intermediate  and  an  extended  Minor  Trend  is  often
more difﬁcult to make with individual stocks than it is with the Averages,
but  it  is  not  so  important.)  But  sooner  or  later,  trends  change;  they  may
change  by  reversing  from  up  to  down  or  down  to  up,  and  they  may  also
change  direction  without  reversing  as,  for  example,  from  up  to  sideways
and  then  perhaps  to  up  again,  or  from  a  moderate  slope  to  a  steep  slope,
and vice versa.

Proﬁts are made by capitalizing on up or downtrends, by following them
until they are reversed. The investor’s problem is to recognize a proﬁtable
trend at the earliest possible stage of its development and then later to detect,
again  as  quickly  as  possible,  its  end  and  Reversal.  The  Reversal  of  any
important  trend  is  usually  characterized,  as  we  have  already  seen,  by  the
construction of some sort of joint price and volume pattern — in brief, of a
Reversal Formation.

The Trendline

All  of  the  foregoing  statements  regarding  trends  have  been  expressed  or
implied  in  earlier  chapters  of  this  text.  It  is  our  purpose  now  to  examine
trends, as such, more closely, to see how they may be plotted most effectively
on the charts, and determine to what extent they can be used to reinforce or
supplement the technical forecasts derived from our other chart formation
and  Support–Resistance  studies  —  sometimes  to  furnish  even  earlier  fore-
casts or warnings of change.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

One  of  the  ﬁrst  discoveries  a  new  student  is  likely  to  make  when  he
begins to inspect stock charts with a critical eye is that nearly all Minor and
most  Intermediate  Trends  follow  nearly  straight  lines. A  few  readers  will,
perhaps, dismiss this as perfectly natural, something to be taken for granted.
But  the  majority  become  increasingly  amazed  and  excited  as  they  delve
deeper.  Not  only  the  smaller  ﬂuctuations,  but,  frequently,  also  the  great
Primary  Swings  of  several  years’  duration  appear  on  the  charts  as  though
their courses had been plotted with a straight-edge ruler. This phenomenon
is, in truth, the most fascinating, impressive, and mysterious of all that the
stock charts exhibit.

If  we  actually  apply  a  ruler  to  a  number  of  charted  price  trends,  we
quickly discover that the line which most often is really straight in an uptrend
is a line connecting the lower extremes of the Minor Recessions within those
trends. In other words, an advancing wave in the stock market is composed
of a series of ripples, and the Bottoms of each of these ripples tend to form
on, or very close to, an upward slanting straight line. The Tops of the ripples
are usually less even; sometimes, they also can be deﬁned by a straight line,
but more often, they vary slightly in amplitude, and so any line connecting
their upper tips would be more or less crooked.

On  a  Descending  Price  Trend,  the  line  most  likely  to  be  straight  is  the
  of  the  Minor  Rallies  within  it,  while  the  Minor

Tops
one  that  connects  the 
Bottoms may or may not fall along a straight edge.

These  two  lines  —  the  one  that  slants  up  along  the  successive  wave
Bottoms within a broad up-move and the one that slants down across suc-
cessive wave Tops within a broad down-move — are the basic trendlines.

It is unfortunate that a more distinctive name for them has never been
devised than the threadbare word “line,” which has so many other uses and
connotations. A  few  analysts  have  called  them  “tangents,”  a  term  that  has
the advantage of novelty, but, because it is a distinct perversion of the true
,  confuses  many  readers  even  more.  Perhaps
meaning  of  the  word 
tangent will eventually become established in this new sense. However, we
shall  be  satisﬁed  herein  with  the  overworked  “line,”  but  can  give  it  some
distinctiveness in its present context by joining it to trend in the one word
“trendline.”

tangent

Trendlines,  you  may  have  heard  it  said,  “are  made  to  be  broken,”  but
that is one of those exasperatingly sententious remarks which fails to clarify
anything. Of course they are broken; they are all always broken, ultimately,
and some very shortly after they are set up. The problem is to decide which
breaks  (i.e.,  penetrations  by  a  price  movement)  are  of  important  technical
signiﬁcance and which are of no practical consequence, requiring possibly
only a Minor Correction in the drawing of the original trendline. There are
no  100%  certain,  quick  answers  to  this  problem;  the  signiﬁcance  of  some
penetrations cannot be determined as soon as they appear, but must await
conﬁrmatory indications from other chart developments. In a great majority
of  instances,  however,  an  important  break  —  one  that  requires  a  prompt
review and possibly a revision of trading policy — is easy to recognize.

FIGURE  147.
A  series  of  Intermediate  Trendlines  drawn  to  illustrate  the  “basic”
principle (see below) on a weekly chart of Atlantic Reﬁning, extending from January
1944  through  August  1947.  Observe  that  each  up  trendline  required  two  distinct
Bottom  points  to  determine  it,  and  each  down  trendline,  two  Tops.  In  some  cases,
the two determining points were formed only a few weeks apart, as in August and
September  1945.  The  Bottom  points  that  ﬁxed  the  early  1946  up  trendline,  on  the
other hand, were months apart — February and June.

Many  other  experimental  lines  might  have  been  drawn  on  this  chart  originally,
including several uptrends whose Intermediate authority was questionable because
they were “too steep” — as in early 1944, late 1945, and early 1946.

Only ﬁnal trendlines are shown here.
There are here also some interesting examples of Pullbacks (after trendline pene-
tration)  which  are  discussed  on  the  following  pages.  Note  July  1944,  April  1945,
September 1945, and May 1947.

How Trendlines Are Drawn

But ﬁrst, how are trendlines drawn? A straight line is mathematically deter-
mined  by  any  two  points  along  it.  In  order  to  draw  a  trendline,  therefore,
we require two determining points — two established Top Reversal points
to ﬁx a Down Trendline and two established Bottom Reversal points to ﬁx
an Up Trendline. The principle here is the same as the one we laid down in
our speciﬁcations for drawing Triangle boundary lines in Chapter 8. The fact
is  that  boundary  lines  of  Triangles  and  Rectangles,  as  well  as  necklines  of
Head-and-Shoulders Formations, are simply special types of trendlines.

Suppose we start with a Major Bottom point and describe how a series
of  Up  Trendlines  might  develop  therefrom.  To  make  this  ﬁrst  illustration
simple, let us assume that the Bear Market Bottom in our stock consisted of
and 8, and that the last move in this formation
a Rectangle area between 6
arose from the 6
level, broke through the pattern’s Top at 8, and proceeded
to 9. From 9, prices reacted to 8 and then headed back up again. As soon as
this last rally had gone far enough to leave the dip to 8 showing in the clear
as a Minor Bottom, we could draw our ﬁrst Up Trendline because we then
),  to  ﬁx  its
had  two  Bottom  points,  the  second  (8)  higher  than  the  ﬁrst  (6
slope. This would be a Minor Up Trendline. We would rule it in lightly on
our chart in pencil, and extend it on up and ahead for, perhaps, a week or
more. (It will help you to visualize our example if you sketch it on a scrap
of chart paper.)

½

To proceed, suppose prices push up to 10, then move sideways for a few
days, or dip slightly, until they have approached and touched, once more,
our extended Minor Trendline. Then they start to move up in a third advance,
but run into supply again without making much progress, quickly make a
fourth contact with the trendline, hesitate, and then break down through it.
If prices now close clearly below the line, and if, in addition, there has been
some pickup in trading volume evident on the penetration, we may conclude
that our ﬁrst Minor Trend is completed, and that our stock either will build
some sort of Consolidation Pattern before it stages another advance, or will
suffer a more extensive “Correction” than any of the brief dips it registered
during its ﬁrst Minor Upswing.

The  whole  Minor  Uptrend  we  have  described  as  an  example  in  the
foregoing  paragraphs  might  well  have  run  its  course  in  2  weeks,  and  our
ﬁrst trendline would then have been very steep — too steep, obviously, to
hold  for  any  very  long  period  of  time.  Now,  let  us  assume  that  a  series  of
downward  ﬂuctuations  produces  the  more  extensive  correction  which  we
have foreseen as one probability following the trendline break, and that this
carries  prices  back  to  the  Support  Level  set  up  at  the  Top  of  the  original
Rectangle,  i.e.,  at  8.  (From  our  previous  Support–Resistance  studies,  we
would  recognize  this  as  a  prime  “buy  spot.”)  Assuming  that  subsequent
developments  pursue  a  normal  course,  prices  should  not  linger  long  at  8,
but should start promptly on a new series of advancing ﬂuctuations. As soon
as  this  becomes  evident  and  the  new  Bottom  at  8  is  “in  the  clear,”  we  can
rule  in  a  new  trendline  across  the  original  base  point  at  6
and  the  new
Intermediate
  Up  Trendline
point  at  8.  This  should  be,  and  probably  is,  an 
which  will  not  be  penetrated  for  several  weeks,  and  maybe  for  several
months, until the Intermediate Advance tops out.

½ 

Then, if that Intermediate Top takes the form of a Head-and-Shoulders
Reversal  Pattern,  our  Intermediate  Up  Trendline  may  be  broken  by  the
recession from the top of the head to the neckline. As a rule, however, the
ﬁnal  advance  in  a  strong  Intermediate  Move  accelerates  far  enough  away
from  the  extended  trendline  to  leave  room  (to  the  right  on  the  chart)  for

This 1935–36 daily chart of Atchison illustrates how the latter part of
a long, strong Intermediate Advance may accelerate away from its trendline. (Notice
the  action  in  late  January  and  early  February.)  Prices  dropped  back  to  66  in April
1936 after this Up Trendline was broken at the end of March. Note also that at the
point where the December 1935 reaction met Support, the trendline coincided with
a Triangle apex level. Such “coincidences” appear frequently in technical studies.

considerable pattern construction before the line is again touched and pen-
etrated. Hence, the actual puncturing of the trendline is more apt to occur
either on the decline from the right shoulder to the neckline, or at about the
same time as prices break down through the neckline to complete the Head-
and-Shoulders signal. It is surprising to see how often the two lines, neckline
and  trendline,  are  broken 
.  In  other  instances,  and  there  are
many of them also, in which the trendline is the ﬁrst to be punctured, perhaps
shortly  after  prices  turn  down  from  the  right  shoulder,  we  do  not  have  to
wait  for  a  neckline  break  but  can  take  action  at  once.  Here  is  one  type  of
trendline  indication  which  produces  a  working  signal  a  little  earlier,  and
often at a much more favorable price level, than is given by the completion
of a Reversal Formation.

begun to ponder the difference between trendlines projected on the ordinary

or arithmetic scale and on the logarithmic or ratio scale. A series of points
which fall on a perfectly straight, up-sloping line on arithmetic chart paper
will, when transferred to a semilogarithmic sheet, produce a curved line that
rises sharply at ﬁrst and then gradually rounds over. And points which fall
on  a  straight  line  on  a  semilogarithmic  sheet  will  produce  an  accelerating
curve on an arithmetic sheet, a line which slants up more and more steeply
the farther it is projected.

As a matter of fact, this variance is of little or no importance in deﬁning
Minor Trends, since they seldom run far enough for the dissimilar charac-
teristics of the two types of scales to become effective. And the same holds
true for average Intermediate Moves of normal slope. But when it comes to
very  long  and  strong  Intermediates,  the  divergence  may  become  marked,
may  make  a  considerable  difference  in  the  time  and  level  of  ultimate
trendline  penetration.  Therein  lies  one  of  the  strongest  reasons  for  using
semilogarithmic  paper  in  charting  stocks  for  technical  analysis.  But  let  us
postpone further discussion of this point until we take up Major Trends, and
go on now with the Intermediate Lines which are much the same on either
type  of  scale.  And,  for  the  present,  let  us  concentrate  on  Intermediate
Uptrends
.  (Intermediate  Moves  are  emphasized  rather  than  Minor  for  the
obvious  reason  that  the  latter  are  of  little  practical  importance  in  either
trading or investing.)

To go back to ﬁrst principles, and granting that price advances trend up
in more or less straight lines, it follows that if we can ﬁnd and draw the lines
that accurately deﬁne those trends, they will serve two purposes, as follows:

1. When the trendline is broken (i.e., when prices drop down through
it in decisive fashion), it signals that the advance has run out. It calls
time for the intermediate-term trader to sell out that issue, and look
for reinvestment opportunities elsewhere.

2. When  a  small  Top  Reversal  Pattern  forms  on  the  chart  of  an  issue
well  up  and  away  from  that  issue’s  Intermediate  Up  Trendline,  so
that  there  apparently  is  room  for  the  downside  implications  of  the
Reversal Formations to be carried out 
 the trendline is violated,
then  the  intermediate-trend  trader  may  well  decide  to  ignore  the
small Reversal Pattern. He can hold on so long as the trendline holds.

before

The advantages of the ﬁrst-named trendline function are obvious. Those
of the second, though less obvious to the inexperienced, are equally impor-
tant to the investor who has learned that it is an expensive practice to switch
out  of  every  holding  as  soon  as  it  shows  evidence  of  a  Minor  Setback,
provided the chance of further Intermediate Advance still exists.

To  accomplish  these  purposes  it  is  necessary,  as  we  have  said,  to  ﬁnd
and draw the line that accurately deﬁnes the Intermediate Trend, and then
to recognize when that line has been broken in decisive fashion. Our earlier

Trendlines which deﬁned the short-term swings in Crane Company
in 1945. Note that three Bottoms formed on the ﬁrst up-line and that the third rally
(late  February)  in  this  advance  failed  to  reach  a  line  drawn  across  the  earlier  Tops
parallel  to  the  Basic  Trendline. A  failure  of  this  sort  frequently  precedes  a  break  in
the trend. The same thing happened at the end of the second uptrend in late May.
“Failures”  and  the  use  of  parallel  or  “Return”  Lines  will  be  discussed  later  in  this
chapter.

The downtrend in March assumed Wedge form. Observe how the April 6 reaction
met Support at its previously penetrated Top line. In June, a rally met Resistance at
the previously broken Up Trendline. Such Pullbacks are common. The small Complex
Head-and-Shoulders in June was never completed, since prices did not break down
out of it by the required margin.

points thoroughly.

Tests of Authority

Here  are  some  of  the  tests  which  may  be  applied  to  judge  the  technical
validity, the authority, of an Up Trendline:

A. The greater the number of Bottoms that have developed at (or very
near)  a  trendline  in  the  course  of  a  series  of  Minor  Up  Waves,  the
greater the importance of that line in the technical sense. With each
successive “test,” the signiﬁcance of the line is increased. A ﬁrst and
tentative  Up  Trendline  can  be  drawn  as  soon  as  two  Bottoms  have
formed, the second higher than the ﬁrst, but if prices move back to

that line a third time, make a third Bottom there and start a renewed
advance, then the validity of that line as a true deﬁnition of the trend
  by  the  action  of  the  market.  Should  a  fourth
has  been 
Bottom later form on it, and prices move up away from it again, its
value as a trend criterion is very considerably enhanced, etc.

conﬁrmed

B. The  length  of  the  line,  i.e.,  the  longer  it  has  held  without  being
penetrated downside by prices, the greater its technical signiﬁcance.
This principle, however, requires some qualiﬁcation. If your trendline
is drawn from two original Bottoms which are very close together in
time — say, less than a week apart — it is subject to error; it may be
too steep or (more often) too ﬂat. If the latter, prices may move away
from  it  and  stay  high  above  it  for  a  long  time;  they  may  then  turn
down  and  have  declined  well  along  in  an  Intermediate  Correction
before the trendline thus drawn is reached. But if the trendline has
been drawn from Bottoms which are far enough apart to have devel-
oped as independent wave components of the trend you are trying
to deﬁne, with a good rally and “open water” between them, then it
is more apt to be the true trendline. Greater weight should be given
to  the  number  of  Bottoms  that  have  formed  on  a  trendline  (Test  1)
than to its length alone (Test 2).

C. The angle of the trendline (to the horizontal) is also, to some degree,
a criterion of its validity as a true delimiter of Intermediate Trend. A
very steep line can easily be broken by a brief sideways Consolidation
move — as, for example, by a compact Flag forming on an advance
of the “mast” type — only to have prices shoot up again in another
extensive advance. Such steep lines are of little forecasting value to
the technician. The ﬂatter, more nearly horizontal the trendline, the
more important it is technically and, in consequence, the greater the
signiﬁcance of any downside break through it.

But “steep,” as applied to stock trends, is a relative term, and one which,
we must frankly confess, deﬁes exact deﬁnition. Experience, which can only
be gained by studying many charts and by actually building and working
with them over a period of many months, brings an almost intuitive ability
to  distinguish  between  a  trendline  which  is  “too  steep  to  hold”  and  one
whose angle of rise is reasonable and should be maintained until such time
as the trend is actually reversed from Intermediate Up to Intermediate Down.
Trend slopes will vary from stock to stock according to their characteristic
market  habits.  They  will  vary  also  according  to  the  stages  of  the  Primary
Cycle — tending to become somewhat steeper in its later phases. The more
chart history you have on any particular issue in which you are interested,
the better able you will be to judge its present trend.

(The foregoing statement, we might remark, applies to the interpretation

of most other technical patterns and phenomena as well as to trendlines.)

Intermediate  Downtrend  and  Uptrend  in  Commercial  Solvents  in
1946.  Note  the  increased  volume  on  the  March  30  penetration  of  the  basic  Down
Trendline  (and,  at  the  same  time,  a  breakout  from  a  small  Head-and-Shoulders
Bottom). The drop through the lower parallel at the end of February had no technical
signiﬁcance. The Up Trendline from the March low was broken on June 14, simulta-
neously  with  a  breakout  from  a  Descending  Triangle  which,  as  it  turned  out,  was
the ﬁnal Bull Market Top.

One  clue  to  relative  steepness  is  afforded  to  those  who  employ  the
TEKNIPLAT semilogarithmic chart sheet, which has been used for most of
the  illustrations  in  this  book.  When  projected  on  this  scale,  Intermediate
Uptrends  on  the  daily  charts,  in  the  great  majority  of  issues  selling  in  the
10 to 50 range, rise at an angle of approximately 30 degrees to the horizontal.
Some will be a triﬂe ﬂatter, some a triﬂe steeper, but it is surprising to see
how  often  the  trendline  falls  very  close  to  the  30-degree  slope  in  stocks  of
average  volatility  and  activity.  Thin,  highly  speculative  issues  and  heavy
investment stocks offer exceptions, the former usually steeper and the latter
ﬂatter.  The  semilogarithmic  scale  has  the  virtue,  of  course,  of  reducing  all
movements,  regardless  of  price  level,  to  a  ratio  or  percentage  basis.  On  a
straight arithmetic scale, the trendline will ordinarily be steeper on a stock
trading in the 50 range, for example, than on an issue selling around 15.

On weekly charts employing the same price scale, the angle of Interme-
diate Advance  will,  of  course,  be  much  steeper  than  on  the  daily  plotting.
Different scaling will produce different angles. It is pure happenstance that
the TEKNIPLAT sheets tend to produce the 30-degree ascending line.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Validity of Penetration

We have these three criteria, then, for appraising the authority or accuracy
of an Intermediate Up Trendline: (1) the number of times it has been “tested”
or contacted without breaking, (2) its length or duration, and (3) its angle of
ascent. Given a trendline which, by the application of one or more of these
criteria  (preferably  by  at  least  two  of  them),  appears  to  be  a  reasonably
accurate  delimiter  of  the  trend,  our  next  problem  is  to  determine  when  it
has been ﬁnally and deﬁnitely broken.

Again, we can set up three tests or criteria, two of which are practically
identical with the rules laid down in earlier chapters for determining decisive
extent of
breakouts from Reversal or Consolidation Formations. The ﬁrst is 
penetration
. To be decisive, prices must not only push through the line, but
close beyond it by a margin equal to about 3% of the stock’s price. This does
not  need  to  be  accomplished  in  a  single  day,  although  it  often  is.  The  3%
penetration may come as a result of 2 or 3 days of gradual decline.

The second is 

volume of trading

. We saw how activity should always be
expected to rise notably on a genuine upside breakout from an Area Pattern,
but  need  not  increase  to  conﬁrm  a  downside  break.  We  have  seen  how,  in
many cases, volume does not show much increase on the ﬁrst day of down-
break from Descending Triangles, for example, but usually picks up rapidly
Up
as the decline proceeds. In our present discussion, we are dealing with 
Trendlines,  and  their  penetration  is,  therefore,  analogous  to  a  downside
breakout. We should expect the same rules to apply, and in general, they do.
Given  a  close  beyond  the  line  by  a  price  margin  of  3%,  it  is  not  necessary
for volume to have expanded much at that point to conﬁrm the validity of
the penetration.

The fact is, however, that the breaking of an Intermediate Up Trendline,
much  more  often  than  not,  is  attended  by  some  visible  intensiﬁcation  of
trading activity. To that extent, then, an increase in volume may be regarded
as conﬁrmation of a decisive penetration. It is a particularly useful adjunct
in  borderline  cases.  If,  for  example,  prices  start  to  decline  from  a  point
conspicuously
somewhat  above  the  trendline,  move  down  through  it  on 
expanding
 turnover, and close beyond it, say, only 2% of the price but at or
near the bottom of the day’s range, our 3% margin rule has not been satisﬁed,
 the volume action may be construed as decisive.
but the lesser margin 
Beware,  however,  and  do  not  be  stampeded  into  a  hasty  commitment
by the shakeout move which cracks down through a trendline with a great
ﬂurry of activity — perhaps several minutes of late tape — and then turns
up  again  to  close  the  day  back  above  the  trend  or  at  least  very  close  to  it.
This  may  very  well  be  —  in  fact,  usually  is  —  a  false  move  so  far  as  that
particular moment is concerned. But watch the next few days’ performance
very closely; the technical situation is evidently critical, else a shakeout could
not have been easily staged.

FIGURE 151.
Valid trendline penetration and its normal consequences — Reaction
or Consolidation — is illustrated on nearly every chart in this chapter and on many
others throughout the book. The above weekly chart of Phillips Petroleum, however,
is reproduced here to show an outstanding exception. The Intermediate Up Trendline
projected  from  “P’s”  September  1936  low  up  across  its  early  October  and  late  No-
vember  Bottoms  was  penetrated  downside  decisively  the  third  week  of  May  1937.
Moreover,  a  Multiple  Head-and-Shoulders  Top  Reversal  Pattern  had  been  forming
since February, with a critical neckline at 52. And the then current Bull Market had
already  run  for  4  years;  “P”  had  come  all  the  way  up  from  2!  Cover  up  the  chart
from  July  1,  1937  on,  and  you  will  agree  that  there  was  plenty  of  reason  for  any
technician to sell at once without waiting for the 52 neckline to be broken. But this,
as we have said, was one of the exceptions which occur to all technical patterns and
rules. “P” turned right around and shot up to 64 before it was ﬁnished. Nevertheless,
developments such as this carry a valuable warning. They very seldom appear unless
the Major Trend has almost run out; any further rise is dangerous to follow.

The  third  test  is  also  one  that  applies  particularly  to  breaks  which  are
borderline  so  far  as  margin  of  penetration  is  concerned.  Suppose  a  stock
which  is  quoted  in  the  neighborhood  of  40  declines  through  a  well-estab-
lished  Intermediate  Up  Trendline  and  closes  1  or  1
points  below  it  —  a
margin which is only slightly less than our speciﬁed 3% — without much,
if any, enlargement in trading volume. Suppose it ﬂuctuates there for a day
or  two  in  a  dull  and  narrow  market,  and  then  starts  to  rally.  If  there  is  no
pickup in activity on this recovery move — if prices simply edge up feebly

to  the  underside  of  the  trendline  and  tend  to  “round  over”  there  without
being  able  to  close  clearly  above  it  —  then  the  situation  is  indeed  critical,
and the slightest sign of renewed selling pressure may be taken as a signal
that the uptrend has been decisively broken.

Such a return move as we have described in the preceding paragraph is
known as a Throwback or Pullback. We have previously described analogous
developments which follow breakouts from Head-and-Shoulders and other
patterns, and will have more to say about them in connection with trendlines
later on.

The  three  tests  we  have  been  discussing,  which  help  to  establish  the
validity of a trendline penetration, cannot, unfortunately, be applied inﬂex-
ibly  and  without  a  modicum  of  judgment.  The  majority  of  Intermediate
Trendlines can hardly be said to possess the precision of pattern boundary
lines, and even in the latter, some leeway must be allowed. There are excep-
tions,  as  we  have  taken  occasion  to  remark  several  times  before,  to  every
technical rule of price action. But judgment in the establishing of signiﬁcant
trendlines and in interpreting their penetrations does come with experience.

Amendment of Trendlines

When a trendline is broken by a margin less than decisive, and prices sub-
sequently  rally  back  up  through  it  again,  doubt  naturally  arises  as  to  the
continued authority of the original line. Should it be discarded, revised, or
allowed to stand as is?

Here again, judgment and experience must be called into play, but a few
general principles are helpful in deciding. If the original trendlines depended
on  only  two  points,  i.e.,  on  the  ﬁrst  two  Bottoms  across  which  it  was  pro-
jected,  and  the  indecisive  penetration  occurred  when  prices  returned  to  it
for the third time, the line had better be redrawn across the original ﬁrst and
the  new  third  Bottoms.  (Of  course,  you  will  not  do  this  until  prices  have
moved up from the third Bottom point and it has become clearly established
as a Minor Bottom.) Or, you may ﬁnd in such cases that a new line drawn
 and third Bottoms works better; if the ﬁrst Bottom was a
across the 
 level well above the low of its range, you may
Reversal Day with its 
ﬁnd that this new line, when extended back, strikes just about at that closing
level.

closing

second

If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  original  trendline  has  been  “tested”  one  or
more  times  after  it  was  drawn  —  if,  that  is,  a  third  and  perhaps  a  fourth
Bottom have formed on it without penetrating it and have thus “conﬁrmed”
it — then the subsequent indecisive penetration may be disregarded and the
original line considered to be still in effect.

An intraday break through an established trendline that, however, does
not result in prices closing beyond the line may be disregarded and the line
left as is. In fact, as has already been suggested, the closing prices frequently
make  a  better  trendline  than  the  extreme  intraday  lows  of  successive

Double Trendlines (see next page) usually are not evident until after
a trend has run for several months. In Paramount’s accelerated phase of Intermediate
Uptrend which began in October 1945, the double nature of the basic trendline was
not detectable until January 1946. The inner (upper) line was broken again in April,
but the outer (lower) line was not decisively penetrated downside until May, at the
Bull Market Top.

Bottoms, and this is most apt to be true with “thin” stocks subject to erratic
swings. A bit of experimenting with different lines often pays. A thin, trans-
parent ruler is especially useful for trendline study.

There  is  another  type  of  price  action  that  may  require  redrawing  a
trendline. Sometimes, after a line has been projected up across the ﬁrst two
Minor Bottoms in an advancing trend, a third Minor Bottom will form, not
on that line, but well above it. In such cases, let the original line stand, but
draw  in  a  new  one  across  the  second  and  third  Bottom  points,  and  watch
developments. If the rally from the third Bottom peters out quickly, and the
new trendline, as a consequence, is soon broken, then the original trendline
is probably the correct one. But, if the third Bottom turns out to be a “strong”
one,  and  the  new  line  stands  up  well  for  several  weeks  (and  if  it  was  not,
patently, too steep to begin with), then the old line may be abandoned and
the new one regarded as the better trend deﬁner.

Double Trendlines and Trend Ranges

In the course of your “cutting and trying” in an effort to ﬁt a good line to
, perhaps a point
an Intermediate Uptrend, you may ﬁnd that 
or so apart in a stock selling in the thirties, will deﬁne the true trend pattern
much  better  than  any  single  line  that  can  be  drawn.  Sharp  Bottoms  and
shakeout thrusts in such cases will often fall along the outer or lower line,
while the duller, more rounded reactions will stop at or near the upper or
inner line. Or the two lines will mark off a 
 somewhere within which
successive Minor Down Waves tend to halt and reverse.

lines

Such  Double  Trendlines  are  really  plentiful,  although  the  majority  of
chart technicians seem to be quite unaware of them. It pays to develop an
eye for them — to watch constantly for trends to which they can be applied.
They will clear up many situations in which attempts to ﬁnd a single critical
line lead only to frustration and in ﬁnally giving up in disgust.

Trends that you ﬁnd are best deﬁned by Double Trendlines (or by a very
Broad Trendline, if you prefer) cannot be regarded as ended until the outer,
lower line has been decisively penetrated. In that connection, note what we
said at the beginning of this topic: sharp, shakeout Bottoms tend to fall on
the outer line. The recoveries from such Bottoms are usually just as sharp,
and prices, therefore, rally back above the upper, inner line quickly. Warning
of an impending break in the trend is given when prices come down to the
outer  line  steadily,  rather  than  by  the  quick  “shake”  type  of  reaction,  and

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

then have difﬁculty rallying back through the inner line. Watch such devel-
opments  closely. A  break  down  may  not  follow;  the  situation  may  still  be
“saved,” but the chances are that the trend is near its end.

Trend Channels

At the start of this trend study, we applied the term Basic Trendline to the
line which slopes up across the Wave Bottoms in an advance, and to the line
  in  a  decline. And  we  noted  that
which  slopes  down  across  the  Wave 
the opposite Reversal Points, i.e., the wave crests in an advance and the wave
troughs in a decline, were, as a rule, less clearly delimited. That is one of the
reasons why all of our discussion up to this point has been devoted to Basic
Trendlines. Another  reason  is,  of  course,  that  the  technician’s  most  urgent
task  is  to  determine  when  a  trend  has  run  out,  and  for  that  purpose,  the
Basic Line is all important.

Tops

Tops

In  a  fair  share  of  normal  trends,  however,  the  Minor  Waves  are  sufﬁ-
ciently regular to be deﬁned at their other extremes by another line. That is,
the 
  of  the  rallies  composing  an  Intermediate  Advance  sometimes
develop along a line which is approximately parallel to the Basic Trendline
Return Line
,
projected along their Bottoms. This parallel might be called the 
since it marks the zone where reactions (return moves against the prevailing
trend)  originate.  The  area  between  Basic  Trendline  and  Return  Line  is  the
Trend Channel.

Nicely  deﬁned  Trend  Channels  appear  most  often  in  actively  traded
stocks of large outstanding issue — least often in the less popular and the
relatively thin equities which receive only sporadic attention from investors.
The value of the Trend Channel concept for the technical trader would hardly
seem to require extended comment here; its tactical utilization is discussed
in the second half of this book.

Its greatest utility, however, is not what usually appeals to the beginner
when he ﬁrst makes its acquaintance, viz., the determination of good proﬁt-
taking  levels.  Experienced  technicians  ﬁnd  it  more  helpful  in  a  negative
sense. Thus, once a Trend Channel appears to have become well established,
any failure of a rally to reach the Return Line (top parallel of the channel in
an  Intermediate Advance)  is  taken  as  a  sign  of  deterioration  in  the  trend.
Further,  the  margin  by  which  a  rally  fails  to  reach  the  Return  Line  (before
turning  down)  frequently  equals  the  margin  by  which  the  Basic  Trendline
is penetrated by the ensuing decline before a halt or Throwback in the latter
occurs.

By the same token, given an established Trend Channel, when a reaction
from  the  Return  Line  fails  to  carry  prices  all  the  way  back  to  the  Basic
Trendline but bottoms out somewhere above it, the advance from that Bot-
tom  will  usually  push  up  out  of  the  channel  on  the  top  side  (through  the
Return Line) by a margin approximately equal to the margin by which the
reaction failed to reach the bottom of the channel (Basic Trendline).

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Experimental Lines

Your experienced technician, in fact, is constantly drawing trendlines of all
sorts — Minor, Intermediate, and Major — on his charts. He will put them
in at ﬁrst very lightly penciled wherever he can ﬁnd an excuse to draw one.
Many will quickly prove to be of no signiﬁcance, and those he may erase.
Others will “stand up” — will show evidence of technical authority — and
those he will make heavier, or color as suggested later on. He will be con-
stantly on the watch for Double Trendlines and will draw tentative Return
Lines to mark off possible channels at every opportunity. As soon as he has
what  appears  to  be  a  Basic  Up  Trendline  projected  from  two  Bottoms,  for
example, he will go back to the Top of the rally between those two Bottoms
and draw from that parallel to the Bottom Trendline. If the next rally comes
up  to  that  parallel,  stops  there  and  turns  down,  he  has  a  probable  Return
Line and channel established.

This  practice  of  drawing  in  and  experimenting  with  every  trendline,
which the price action permits or suggests, is earnestly recommended to the
reader of this book, particularly if the technical approach is new to him. It
is the quickest way — in fact, the only way — of acquiring the experience
we  have  stressed  as  essential  to  recognition,  judgment,  and  utilization  of
trendline implications in trading.

Perhaps we should add here one “don’t” for the beginner. You will have
noted that nowhere have we mentioned a line projected from a Bottom to a
Top, or vice versa. Trendlines are 
 drawn across two or more Bottoms,
or two or more Tops. They should never be drawn to cross through the price
track.  (Prices  may  cross  their  extensions  later,  but  this  should  not  have
happened at the time the lines are ﬁrst drawn.) If you did not know better,
you  might,  for  example,  put  in  a  line  from  the  Top  of  the  left  shoulder  to
the  Top  of  the  right  shoulder  of  a  Head-and-Shoulders  Formation,  thus
cutting through the head, but such a line would have no technical validity.

Consequences of Trendline Penetration — Throwbacks

At the beginning of this chapter, we mentioned the probable consequences
of  a  break  down  through  an  Intermediate  Up  Trendline.  To  repeat,  if  an
Intermediate Up Trendline has been constructed, has qualiﬁed as technically
signiﬁcant  by  the  tests  previously  discussed,  and  has  then  been  decisively
broken,  the  inference  is  that  uptrend  is  ﬁnished. And  the  consequences  to
be expected are either a full Intermediate Recession or a period of Consoli-
dation (usually becoming a recognizable Area Formation). Technical indica-
tions  of  other  sorts  may  be  seen  on  the  chart,  which  will  suggest  to  you
which  of  these  two  consequences  is  the  more  likely.  In  either  event,  the
Intermediate Trend trader will certainly look twice before attempting to ﬁnd
further proﬁt in that particular situation at that time.

A more immediate but less important probable consequence of trendline
penetration has also been mentioned — the “Pullback.” This deserves further
discussion. Pullbacks that follow breakouts from Reversal and Consolidation
Formations have been described in our earlier studies of those price patterns.
It is easy to understand why a rally which develops after prices break out
through  the  lower  boundary  of  a  Rectangle,  for  example,  will  be  stopped
when it gets back to that boundary by the Resistance (supply) now residing
there.  Support–Resistance  Theory  enables  us  to  rationalize  most  of  the
Throwback moves which occur after prices have broken out of other types
of  Reversal  or  Consolidation Areas.  The  Pullbacks  which  follow  trendline
penetrations  cannot  be  thus  rationalized;  yet  they  occur  much  more  fre-
quently,  and  they  appear  to  be  stopped  much  more  exactly  at  the  old
trendline  level  than  is  the  case  with Area  Formations.  Why  should  prices,
after they have thrust down through a rising trendline, perhaps for several
points, turn back up and ascend to or very near the old trendline, stop there
and then go off in renewed decline? The Top of that Pullback Rally may be
2  or  3  points  above  the  original  penetration  level,  since  the  trendline  is
sloping up all the time; nevertheless, there it stops, falters, gives up. No one
knows why supply should overcome demand, why Resistance should be so
two
plainly  evident  at  that  particular  point  whose  level  is  determined  by 
variants, the 

time
Of  course,  you  cannot  reasonably  expect  a  Pullback  Rally  to  climb  all
the  way  back  to  a  trendline  that  is  ascending  at  a  very  steep  angle,  which
may  mean  the  attainment  of  a  new  high  price  for  the  entire  Intermediate

 of the line and the

FIGURE 158.
The downtrend which started in June 1946 in Nash–Kelvinator, sig-
naled  by  the  break  of  both  its  Intermediate  and  Major  Up  Trendlines  (MUT)  on
July 15,  made  a  nice  channel  until  September.  An  Intermediate  Down  Trendline,
drawn  across  the  June  17  and  July  1  highs,  held  for  the  August  rally.  The  Return
Line, drawn parallel to it across the June 20 low, held in late July but remained intact
for only a few days at the end of August. The August rally in both price and volume
pattern showed Bear Market characteristics. Compare this chart with Figure 68 and
you will see that a Major Double Top was signaled on July 23.

Uptrend; yet even that happens in more than just a few cases. What can be
counted on in the great majority of typical Up Trendlines (those which slant
up at a normal or fairly ﬂat angle) is that after the line has been broken, a
Pullback Rally will develop, either in a few days or in the usual Minor Wave
tempo, and will carry prices back up to the projected trendline.

Return

Throwbacks do not occur, it should be noted, when prices erupt through
 Line, i.e., break out of the top side of an Uptrend Channel. Or, more
a 
correctly  stated,  the  Return  Line  does  not  function  as  a  Support  against  a
Throwback after prices have gone through it. An unusually strong upswing
in a Rising Trend Channel may carry beyond the top of the channel as deﬁned
by its Return Line, but the next reaction may go right back down through
it without evidencing any hesitation at its level.

The Throwback is one of the mysteries in trendline price action to which
we  alluded  at  the  outset.  The  technical  analyst  who  studies  trends  and
trendlines over any considerable period will discover many other even more
mysterious phenomena which cannot ﬁnd space in this treatise, because no
way has yet been found to put them to practical use in trading and investing.

The  decline  that  took  Macy  down  through  an  Intermediate  Up
Trendline (IUT) in June 1946 turned out to be also the drop from the head of a “Flat-
Shouldered” Head-and-Shoulders Top, which was, in turn, part of a larger Complex.
The upper neckline was broken June 19 and the lower on July 16. Note Pullbacks to
each.  F1,  F2,  and  F3  are  tentative  Fan  Lines.  Prices  were  ﬁnally  able  to  clear  F3  in
December,  but  by  that  time  a  Primary  Bear  Market  had  been  signaled;  so,  the  Fan
Rule no longer applied. Fans call the turn only on Secondary (Corrective) Moves.

They  are  extraordinarily  interesting  in  retrospect,  but  are  not  subject  to
forecast.

Intermediate Downtrends

uptrends

In all of the foregoing discussion of trends and trendlines we have concen-
trated  on 
;  we  have,  in  fact,  had  in  mind  speciﬁcally  Intermediate
Advances  in  the  direction  of  the  Primary  Trend,  i.e.,  within  a  Major  Bull
Market. Those particular trends are most apt to develop “normally,” are most
amenable to trendline deﬁnition. Intermediate 
 Moves in a Major Bear
Market may well be taken up next. Before we discuss the respects in which
Basic Trendline
they differ from Primary Advances, we should recall that the 
on a down-move is the line projected across the 
 of the rallies within it.
The Trend Channel will be to the left of that trendline and below it on the
chart. The 

 Line (if any) will deﬁne the 

 of the channel.

Intermediate (Bear Market) Downtrends are far less regular and uniform
in their development than Bull Market Advances. Their angles of decline are
characteristically steeper, and this is particularly true, of course, of the Panic
Moves which are typical of the second phase of a Bear Market, as we saw

“ABZ” dropped sharply following its late January high, capped off
a  nearly  uninterrupted  2-year  rally.  But  despite  the  rapidity  and  severity  of  the
Pullback, it was, in fact, a picture-perfect reaction, which stopped just above excellent
long-term Support at the 1983 high after retracing almost exactly 50% from its January
peak.  Not  only  is  the  reaction  a  classic,  but  so,  too,  is  the  Fan  Line  development
which,  when  coupled  with  the  recently  completed  Head-and-Shoulders  Bottom,
suggests “ABZ” has reversed its short-term downtrend.

in  our  discussion  of  Major  Trends  in  Chapter 3.  Moreover,  prices  have  a
tendency to drop away from any trendline which is drawn across the ﬁrst
two  Rally  Tops;  in  other  words,  to  curve  down  or  accelerate  as  the  move
proceeds.  This  shows  plainly  on  an  arithmetically  scaled  chart  and,  even
more conspicuously on a semilogarithmic sheet.

The 

practical

 results of this down-curving tendency are not so important,
insofar as it delays the penetration of the original trendline and, hence, the
giving  of  a  signal  of  trend  change.  The  fact  is  that  prices  tend  to  thrash
around for some time, making a base at the Bottom of one of these precipitous
declines.  In  so  doing,  they  work  out  sideways  on  the  chart,  and  the  trend
frequently does not turn up visibly until after the trendline has ﬁnally been
reached and broken through on the upside after all. Thus, there is justiﬁcation
for drawing down trendlines and keeping them in view even though they
may seem, for some time, simply to travel off into space with no apparent
relevance to the actual trend of prices.

It  naturally  follows  from  the  above  that  Return  Lines  on  most  Bear
Market  Declines  have  little  practical  utility;  they  are,  more  often  than  not,
very quickly broken downside. Good channels are hard to ﬁnd.

However, and this is of considerable practical importance, the very last
Intermediate Downswing in a Major Bear Market, i.e., the last Primary Move
which leads to the ﬁnal, long-term Bottom, is usually cleaner, more regular,
less  precipitous  —  in  other  words,  a  more  nearly  normal  trend  of  the  sort
we expect to ﬁnd in most Intermediate Advances in a Bull Market (except,
of course, that it slants down instead of up). This interesting habit is, as we
said, of practical importance. Knowing it, we have an additional and very
useful clue to the end of a Bear Market.

When, after a Major Bear Trend has proceeded for some time and dis-
tance,  and  has  experienced  at  least  one  Panic  Sell-Off,  it  then  goes  off  in
another but less active and more orderly decline, and this decline develops
and follows a good trendline. Watch it closely. If this Intermediate holds to
its steady and not-too-steep downward course — if its trendline is contacted
several times by Minor Rallies — if it produces a fairly consistent channel,
and prices do not “fall out of bed” down through its parallel Return Line,
then  the  eventual  upside  penetration  of  this  trendline  may  well  signal  a
Major

 Turn, the inception of a new Bull Market.

Corrective Trends — The Fan Principle

In this study of Intermediate Trendlines, we have left to be taken up last the
subject of Secondary or Corrective Trends. These are the Intermediate Declines
which interrupt the Primary Advances in a Bull Market, and the Intermediate
Recoveries which alternate with Primary Declines in Bear Markets.

Intermediate Reactions against the Major Direction of the market take a
variety of forms. Sometimes, as we have seen in our earlier study of chart
patterns, they run out into Consolidation Formations — Triangles, Rectan-
gles, etc. — in which the net price reaction is of minor consequence, but time
is consumed in backing and ﬁlling before the Primary Trend can be resumed.
In  such  cases,  of  course,  there  is  no  basis  for  drawing  an  Intermediate
Trendline, nor is one needed for any practical purpose.

they pushed up through F1 in March, fell back to it but did not repenetrate it. When
F2 was broken in late March, prices came back to it at the end of April but did not

a  third  to  a  half  of  the  preceding  Primary  Swing.  These  reactions  produce
good trendlines, as a rule, and the eventual penetration of their trendlines
is  a  good  technical  signal  of  Reversal.  Intermediate  Corrections  clearly  of
this type, it may be added, are relatively rare.

A third form taken by Intermediate Corrections is nearly as common as
the ﬁrst named above (Consolidation Pattern) and much more common on
the charts than the second. In a Bull Market, it starts with a sharp reaction
which  proceeds  for  several  days  —  perhaps  for  as  much  as  2  weeks  —
producing  a  steep  Minor  Trendline.  This  line  is  broken  upside  by  a  quick
Minor Rally, after which prices slide off again in a duller and less precipitate
trend. A second Minor Trendline may now be drawn from the original high
point across the Top of the upthrust that broke the ﬁrst trend. This second
trendline is broken by another partial recovery thrust, and a third and still
duller and ﬂatter sell-off ensues. A third trendline can now be drawn from
the  original  high  across  the  Top  of  the  second  upthrust.  The  whole  move,
by this time, has taken roughly and irregularly a “Saucering-out” form. The
three  trendlines  drawn  from  the  original  Reversal  points  from  which  the

There are exceptions to this rule — as there are to every so-called rule
of technical chart analysis. Rarely, a correction of this type will go on to make
another dip to a new low for the whole corrective move before prices really
start  to  round  up  again.  But  the  Three-Fan  Principle  works  in  the  great
majority  of  cases.  Moreover,  it  offers  the  trader  an  opportunity  to  take  a
position  at  a  point  where  he  can  logically  employ  a  very  near  stop  order
and, thus, limit his loss to a controlled amount if the rule does not work out.
It is interesting to note that prices consistently Throwback in these move-
ments to the preceding Fan Line after each upthrust. The new Primary Swing,
once  the  low  has  been  passed,  usually  starts  slowly  and  carries  out  for  a
time the Saucer picture.

The Three-Fan Rule works just as well in calling the turn on Intermediate
Recoveries in a Bear Market, the majority of which take the rounding form
which is adapted to its use.

Note,  however,  that  the  Fan  Principle  is  normally  applied  only  to  cor-
rective moves, i.e., to determine the end of Intermediate Reactions in a Bull
Market and of Intermediate Recoveries in a Bear Market.

In a downtrend throughout the ﬁrst half, “BY” gave back a large part
of its 1983 rally by mid-summer. But the 1982 low held the Bears in check and over
the following several months, this issue etched out an excellent Fan Pattern. Fan Line
1 gave way in mid-September on a high-volume penetration. The advance quickly
lost its momentum, but old Resistance/new Support contained the Pullback perfectly,
setting the stage for a rally through Fan Line 2. This occurred in mid-November on
good volume. Following a 5-week correction, “BY” charged through Fan Line 3 on
the best volume of the 3 breakouts.

Chapter fourteen: Trendlines and Channels

279

We shall take up Major Trendlines in the following chapter, but, before
we leave this study of Intermediate Trends, it will be well to state again that
the practical application of trendlines in actual trading requires experience,
and the good judgment to be attained only therefrom. Some technical ana-
lysts  depend  largely  on  trendline  studies;  a  few  attempt  to  use  trendlines
almost exclusively; but the majority have found that they are best employed
as an adjunct to other technical data.

Technical analysis of a stock chart is something like putting together a
jigsaw puzzle. There are many items to be considered, among them volume,
pattern, and the measurements derived therefrom, Support and Resistance
Levels,  trendlines,  general  market  prospects  —  and  all  ﬁtted  into  place  to
get the complete picture.

chapter ﬁfteen

Major Trendlines

In the preceding chapter on Intermediate Trendlines, mention was made of
the distinctive effects produced by arithmetic and semilogarithmic plotting,
but it was noted that these differences were unimportant in connection with
Minor Trends or Intermediate Trends of average duration. When we come
to Major Trends, however, we ﬁnd the difference does become important.

If  you  will  examine  a  large  collection  of  arithmetically  scaled  monthly
charts covering 10 years or more of market history, you will quickly see that
Bull Trends, in the great majority of actively traded, more or less speculative
. They start slowly and push up at a steeper
common stocks, tend to 
and steeper angle as they approach a Major Top. This up-curving path takes
them farther and farther away from any straight trendline drawn from two
Bottom points in the ﬁrst, slow-moving stage of advance. As a consequence,
they top out and have gone down a long way in a recession which may be
of Major consequence before their straight trendline is again touched.

accelerate

Many  of  the  stocks  that  show  such  typical 

  curves  in  their
advance  (Major)  Trends  on  arithmetic  paper  produce 
  trends  on  a
logarithmic scale. As a consequence, their logarithmic Major Trendlines are
broken more quickly, and usually at a higher price level, when at last their
trends  do  top  out  and  turn  down.  In  the  case  of  such  stocks,  then,  the
logarithmic scale gives a better trend signal.

accelerating

straight

But there are other stocks — mostly of the more substantial investment
or  semi-investment  type  —  which  tend  to  advance  in  straight  arithmetic
trends.  Consolidated  Edison,  General  Motors,  and  Libbey–Owens–Ford
Glass  are  examples.  (The  trends  of  these  on  a  logarithmic  scale  show  a
decelerating  curve,  of  course.)  Still  a  third  class,  made  up  largely  of  high-
grade  preferred  stocks,  produces  a  rounding  over  or  decelerating  Bull
Trendline  even  on  the  arithmetic  scale. And,  ﬁnally,  there  are  a  number  of
issues  whose  normal  Bull  Market  Trendlines  fall  somewhere  between  our
ﬁrst  two  types;  that  is,  they  curve  up  away  from  a  straight  path  on  the
arithmetic scale, but curve over to the right (breaking through a straight line)

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

All of which, the reader, at this point, no doubt ﬁnds most discouraging.
Some stocks do this and some stocks do that, and what help is there for us
in such a mix-up? The answer lies in studying the history of each issue in
which  you  may  be  interested.  Stocks  —  most  of  them,  at  least  —  do  not
change  their  habits  and  their  technical  characteristics  much  from  one  Bull
and Bear cycle to the next. An issue which, like General Motors, produces
a straight-line Bull Trend on an arithmetic chart in one Primary Upswing is
likely to repeat that performance in the next.

As  a  matter  of  interest,  stocks  do  sometimes  change,  of  course,  over  a
long period of years. Companies which were regarded as extremely specu-
lative when their shares were ﬁrst listed may attain a more and more impor-
tant and stable position in the general economy, with the result that, even-
tually,  their  stock  acquires  a  solid  investment  rating.  Their  Bull  Market
Trends will then gradually change from an up-curve to a straight-line and,
ﬁnally, to a decelerating curve. Other old, established corporations may lose
position and rating, shift from the investment type of trendline to the spec-
ulative. But, it is true in general, nevertheless, that Major Patterns do repeat.
If  you  are  keeping  your  own  set  of  manual  monthly  charts,  you  can
choose whichever scale you please. But most technical chart followers prefer
to buy their long-range pictures ready made, thereby getting a much more
extensive history of many more issues than they could hope to chart them-
selves.  Since  the  only  comprehensive  portfolios  of  monthly  charts  that  are
available at reasonable cost are arithmetically scaled, you will possibly have

of good software and also Internet chart sites. See Appendix D, Resources.
 You will
ﬁnd  with  a  little  experimentation  that  an  architect’s  French  curve  can  be
used to plot good Major Uptrend Lines on many of the issues whose normal
Bull Trends accelerate away from a straight line.

The tests for the technical signiﬁcance of a Major Trendline are substan-
tially  the  same  as  those  speciﬁed  for  Intermediate  Lines  in  the  preceding
chapter. A  little  more  leeway  must  be  allowed  on  penetrations  —  again,  a
matter of judgment — but you are dealing with coarse data and long swings
here, and what you want from your monthly charts, primarily, is perspective
on the broad picture.

One more point regarding the construction of Major Bull Trendlines: the
best lines — the most useful — are drawn, as a rule, not from the absolute low
of the preceding Bear Market, but starting, rather, from the next Intermediate
Bottom.  The  accumulation  area  at  the  beginning  of  a  Bull  Market  is  usually
long and drawn out in time, and relatively ﬂat. The ﬁrst trendline that can be
drawn from the extreme low point may, therefore, be too nearly horizontal to
express the genuine Bull Trend which starts with the markup phase. The several
charts showing Major Trendlines which illustrate this chapter will demonstrate
this point. 
 It applies as well, we might add, to many
Intermediate  Moves  which  start  from  Area  Formations.  Take  the
Head-and-Shoulders Pattern for example: the true Intermediate Trendline usu-
ally starts from the right shoulder rather than from the head.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Major Downtrends

From the technical analyst’s point of view, it is to be regretted that few Bear
Markets have produced Major Trendlines of any practical signiﬁcance on the
charts  of  individual  stocks. A  notable  exception  was  the  long  Bear  Market
of  1929–32  which  produced  magniﬁcently  straight  trendlines  on  the  arith-
metic  plotting  of  a  host  of  issues  (as  well  as  in  the Averages,  to  which  we
shall refer later). But it is almost impossible to ﬁnd other instances where a
Bear Trendline having any forecasting value can be drawn on either arith-
metic or semilogarithmic scale.

The 

normal

 Major Bear Market Trend is not only steeper than the normal
Bull  Trend  (because  Bear  Markets  last,  on  the  average,  only  about  half  as
long as Bull Markets), but it is also accelerating or down-curving in its course.
This feature is accentuated and, hence, particularly difﬁcult to project effec-
tively on the semilogarithmic scale.

Major
 to a Primary 

The net of it is that the technician cannot expect to obtain much, if any,
help  from  his 
  Trendlines  in  determining  the  change  from  a  Primary
Down
Upswing
. This should not be taken, however, as advice
to draw no trendlines on a Major Down Move, or to disregard entirely any
trendlines which may develop with some appearance of authority. If you do
not  expect  too  much  of  them,  they  may,  nevertheless,  afford  some  useful
clue as to the way in which conditions are tending to change.

The student of stock market action who is not altogether concerned with
dollars and cents results from his researches will ﬁnd Bear Market Trendlines
a fascinating ﬁeld of inquiry. They do some strange things. Even though they
fail in the practical function of calling the actual Major Turn, and go shooting
off into space, they sometimes produce curious reactions (or, at least, appear
to produce what would be otherwise inexplicable market action) when the
real price trend catches up with them months or years later. But such effects,
interesting as they may be, are, in our present state of knowledge, uncertain

st
thought of like Fermat’s Last Theorem. Our present state of knowledge in the 21
century is no further advanced than it was in Magee’s time.

We must dismiss this rather unfruitful topic with the reminder that one
clue  to  the  end  of  a  Primary  Bear  Market  is  afforded  by  the  Intermediate
Trendline of its ﬁnal phase, which we cited in the preceding chapter.

Major Trend Channels

We run into another difﬁculty when we try to draw Return Lines and con-
struct channels for Major Trends on an arithmetic chart. Owing to the marked
tendency for prices to ﬂuctuate in ever wider swings (both Intermediate and
Minor) as they work upward in a Primary Bull Market, their channel grows
progressively  broader.  The  Return  Line  does  not  run  parallel  to  the  Basic
Trendline (assuming that we have a good Basic Trendline to begin with) but

diverges  from  it.  Occasionally,  a  stock  produces  a  clear-cut  Major  Channel
Pattern, but the majority do not.

Semilogarithmic  scaling  will,  in  many  cases,  correct  for  the  Widening
Channel  effect  in  Bull  Trends,  but  then  we  run  into  the  opposite  tendency
in Primary Bear Markets, and for that, neither type of scaling will compen-
sate.

Trendlines in the Averages

Practically everything stated in the preceding chapter regarding Intermedi-
ate Trendline development in individual stocks applies, as well, to the var-
ious Averages. The broad Averages or Indexes, in fact, produce more regular
trends and, in consequence, more exactly applicable trendlines. This may be
due, in part, to the fact that most Averages are composed of active, well-pub-
licized, and widely owned issues whose market action individually is “nor-
mal” in the technical sense. Another reason is that the process of averaging
smooths out vagaries of component stocks, and the result, thus, more truly
reﬂects the deep and relatively steady economic trends and tides.

In  any  event,  it  is  a  fact  that  such  averages  as  the  Dow–Jones  Rails,
Industrials and 65-Stock Composite, 
 50, and Standard &
Poor’s Average  of  90  stocks  (the  last  two  named  being  probably  the  most
(EN: As the reader
scientiﬁcally composed to typify the entire broad market) 
will note most of these are obsolete. In the modern age, the S&P 500 probably best
fulﬁlls this function)

 do propagate excellent trendlines on their charts.

The New York Times

The very accuracy of their trends, particularly their Intermediate Moves,
permits  us  to  construe  their  trendlines  more  tightly.  Less  leeway  need  be
allowed for doubtful penetrations. Thus, while we ask for a 3% penetration
in  the  case  of  an  individual  stock  of  medium  range,  2%  is  ample  in  the
Averages to give a dependable break signal.

Experienced traders know that it pays to heed the Broad Market Trend.

It is still easier to swim with the tide than against it.

EN: Trendlines in the Averages, and Trading 
in the Averages 

Numerous averages and indexes have come online since the 5th edition: S&P 100,
S&P 500, Russell 2000, and so on. It would be an exercise in daily journalism to
attempt to list all the indexes now available. New ones spring up like weeds after
the spring rain. This is because the invention of a widely adopted index can be very
lucrative for its creator. S&P and Dow–Jones collect licensing fees from the “use”
of their indexes by the exchanges. The constant addition of new trading instruments
requires that current lists be kept in Resources

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

FIGURE 178.
In the process of “pulling back” to a very steep Up Trendline, prices
may easily go to a new high. Note the Pullback of August 1936 in this weekly chart
of Westinghouse Electric. The second, less steep line turned out to be the true Major
Bull Trend. Note that the February–April price pattern in 1936 could not be consid-
ered a true Double Top Reversal of Primary import because the recession between
the two highs was only about 10% of the Top’s value (around 122). Figure 64 on page
119 shows on a daily chart the ﬁnal Top Reversal Formation which “WX” made in
1937.

A  large  Rectangle  base  was  made  on  this  weekly  chart  in  April,  May,  and  June
1937, but observe the poor volume which accompanied the breakout and rise from
that  formation  —  an  extremely  Bearish  indication  for  the  Major  Trend.  The  “mea-
surement” of the Rectangle was carried out by August, but that was all.

As is usually the case, it was impossible to draw a Major Down Trendline which
had  any  forecasting  value  on  this  chart.  The  beautiful  straight  trendlines  which
appeared  in  the  1929–32  Primary  Bear  Market  led  many  chart  students  to  expect
similar developments in every Bear Market, but the fact is that 1929–32 was unique
in that respect.

The 1929–32 Primary Bear Market was the only one in all stock market

As of the turn of the century, the most important of these indexes, joining the
Dow, are probably the S&P 500, the S&P 100, and the NASDAQ. In fact these are
probably  sufﬁcient  for  economic  analysis  and  forecasting  purposes,  and  certainly

good trading vehicles by means of surrogate instruments, options, and futures. Some
would include the Russell 2000 in this list. These indexes and averages have been
created to ﬁll needs not ﬁlled adequately by the Dow–Jones Averages.

With  this  proliferation  of  measures  of  the  market  and  various  parts  of  it  a
different question arises. That is, the value of the Dow alone in indicating the Broad
Market Trend is now questionable. Limited research has been done on this question.
It  is,  however,  my  opinion  that  the  Broad  Market  Trend  must  now  be  determined
by examining the Dow Industrials, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ Composite.

chapter 15.1

Trading the Averages 
in the 21st Century

As I have pointed out in other new chapters and notes in the eighth edition,
the ability to trade the Averages instead of individual stocks is a powerful
choice offered by modern markets. Magee was of the opinion that the Aver-
ages  offered  technical  smoothness  often  lacking  in  individual  issues.  This
would seem to be true intuitively. After all, just as a moving average smooths
data,  the  average  of  a  basket  of  stocks  should  dampen  price  volatility.  Of
course, as Mandelbrot pointed out, in a 10-sigma market storm everything
sinks.

Illustrated in this chapter are several detailed cases following Magee’s
suggestion of Average trading. I attempt to demonstrate here two perspec-
tives:  one,  the  horror  of  the  immediate,  that  is,  what  the  crash  and  panic
look  like  as  they  occur,  and  two,  what  the  crash  and  panic  look  like  in
retrospect. Of course we all live in the present, except for the great billion-
aires, who can afford to doze through horriﬁc Bear Markets. Bill Gates’ net
worth varied by $16B (billion) or $17B in early 2000. This, of course, would
put the ordinary investor out of business.

So the ordinary investor, you and I, have to respect the great yawning
Bear Market. We must step to the sidelines and let the bear eat the foolish
virgins, to borrow a Biblical metaphor.

You will remember that Magee opined that a trendline break of 2% was
sufﬁcient to cause liquidation of longs when analyzing the Averages. In the
accompanying ﬁgures, this hypothesis is examined.

EN9: In respect to the breaking of trendlines (by 2% or 5%) I should note that
  as  a  signal  to  act.  The  break,
the  breaking  of  a  trendline  is  as  much  a 
instead  of  a  change  of  trend  to  the  reverse,  may  indicate  a  change  of  trend  to  the
sideways – into a reversal or continuation pattern.

FIGURE 179.3.
Three Bull Market Tops, 1929, 1987, 1998. Notice here that in each
case  the  crash  occurred  after  the  nearest  important  trendline  had  been  decisively
broken — usually trendlines of approximately 3 months by 2% or more, and some-
times  accompanied  by  reversal  formations. All  historic  tops  will  show  evidence  of
attempts to resume the trend after a break of this kind. Belief dies hard. Nonetheless,
hedging or exiting on these trend breaks proves to be the best strategy over and over
again.

Technical Analysis 
of Commodity Charts

(EN9:  Following  the  practice  of  allowing  the  reader  to  discriminate  between  the
work of Edwards and Magee and that of the Editor, a chapter on commodity trading,
Chapter 16.1, has been added to the 9th Edition. See same.)

A  little  thought  suggests  that  the  variously  interesting  and  signiﬁcant  pat-
terns  which  we  have  examined  in  the  foregoing  chapters  on  stock  charts
should  logically  appear  as  well  in  the  charts  of  any  other  equities  and
commodities  that  are  freely,  constantly,  and  actively  bought  and  sold  on
organized  public  exchanges. And  this,  in  general,  is  true.  The  price  trends
of  anything  where  market  value  is  determined  solely  (or  for  all  practical
purposes  within  very  wide  limits)  by  the  free  interplay  of  supply  and
demand will, when graphically projected, show the same pictorial phenom-
ena of rise and fall, accumulation and distribution, congestion, consolidation,
and reversal that we have seen in stock market trends. Speculative aims and
speculators’ psychology are the same whether the goods dealt in be corporate
shares or contracts for the future delivery of cotton bales.

It should be possible in theory, therefore, to apply our principles of technical
analysis to any of the active commodity futures (wheat, corn, oats, cotton, cocoa,
hides, eggs, etc.) for which accurate daily price and volume data are published.
It should be, that is, if proper allowance is made for the intrinsic differences
between commodity futures contracts and stocks and bonds.

(EN9:  Up  to  the  8th)

In  previous  editions  of  this  book 

,  traders  who  cast
longing eyes on the big, quick proﬁts apparently available in wheat, for exam-
ple, were warned that commodity charts were “of very little help,” as of 1947.
It  was  pointed  out  that  successful  technical  analysis  of  commodity
futures  charts  had  been  possible  up  to  about  1941  or  1942.  But  that  the
domination  of  these  markets  thereafter  by  government  regulations,  loans,
and  purchases  completely  subject  to  the  changing  (and  often  conﬂicting)
policies and acts of the several governmental agencies concerned with grains
and  other  commodities  had  seriously  distorted  the  normal  evaluative
machinery of the market. At that time, radical reversals of trend could and
did happen overnight without any warning so far as the action of the market
could show. The ordinary and orderly ﬂuctuations in supply–demand bal-
ance, which create signiﬁcant deﬁnite patterns for the technician to read, did

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

not exist. And while fortunes were made (and lost) in wheat, corn, and cotton
futures during the World War II period, it is safe to say they were not made
from the charts.

However, during the past 5 or 6 years the application of technical meth-
ods to commodity trading has been reexamined. Under 1956 conditions, it
appears  that  charts  can  be  a  most  valuable  tool  for  the  commodity  trader.
The  effects  of  present  government  regulation  have  apparently  resulted  in
“more orderly” markets without destroying their evaluative function. And
allowing  for  the  various  essential  differences  between  commodities  and
stocks, the basic technical methods can be applied.

It may be in order here to discuss brieﬂy some of the intrinsic differences
between commodity futures and stocks referred to above, and some of the
special traits of commodity charts. To begin with, the most important differ-
ence is that the contracts for future delivery, which are the stock-in-trade of
the commodity exchange, have a limited life. For example, the October cotton
contract for any given year has a trading life of about 18 months. It comes
“on the board” as a “new issue,” is traded with volume increasing more or
less  steadily  during  that  period,  and  then  vanishes.  Theoretically,  it  is  a
distinct and separate commodity from all other cotton deliveries. Practically,
of  course,  it  seldom  gets  far  out  of  line  with  such  other  deliveries  as  are
being bought and sold during the same period, or with the “cash” price of
the physical cotton in warehouses. Nevertheless, it has this special quality
of a limited independent life, as a consequence of which long-term Support
and Resistance Levels have no meaning whatever.

Second, a very large share of the transactions in commodity futures —
as much as 80% certainly in normal times — represents commercial hedging
rather than speculation. (It is, in fact, entered into to obviate risk, to avoid
speculation.)  Hence,  even  near-term  Support  and  Resistance  Levels  have
relatively less potency than with stocks. Also, since hedging is to a consid-
erable  degree  subject  to  seasonal  factors,  there  are  deﬁnite  seasonal  inﬂu-
ences on the commodity price trends which the commodity speculator must
keep in mind, even if only to weigh the meaning of their apparent absence
at any given period.

A  third  difference  is  in  the  matter  of  volume.  The  interpretation  of
volume with respect to trading in stocks is relatively simple. But it is greatly
complicated  in  commodities  by  the  fact  that  there  is,  in  theory,  no  limit  to
the number of contracts for a certain future delivery which may be sold in
advance of the delivery date. In the case of any given stock, the number of
shares outstanding is always known. As this is written, there are in the hands
of stockholders 13,700,203 common shares of Consolidated Edison, and that
quantity has not varied for many years nor is it likely to change for several
years to come. Every transaction in Consolidated Edison involves an actual
transfer  of  one  or  more  of  those  existing  shares.  In  the  case  of  commodity
future  contracts,  however  —  say,  September  wheat  —  trading  begins  long
before anyone knows how many bushels of wheat will exist to be delivered
that coming September, and the open interest at some time during the life

of futures volume data. As always volume data is a supplementary indicator to price.
No one makes a proﬁt on it.

One  more  important  difference  may  be  mentioned.  Certain  kinds  of
news —  news  about  weather,  drought,  ﬂoods,  etc.,  that  affect  the  growing
crop,  if  we  are  dealing  with  an  agricultural  commodity  —  can  change  the
trend of the futures market immediately and drastically and are not foresee-

and Alan Greenspan
.

Under what might be called normal market conditions, those chart pat-
terns which reﬂect trend changes in most simple and logical fashion work
just  as  well  with  commodities  as  with  stocks. Among  these  we  would  list
Head-and-Shoulders  formations,  Rounding  Tops  and  Bottoms,  and  basic
trendlines. Trendlines, in fact, are somewhat better deﬁned and more useful
in  commodities  than  in  stocks.  Other  types  of  chart  formations  which  are
associated  with  stocks  with  short-term  trading  or  with  group  distribution
and accumulation, such as the Triangles, Rectangles, Flags, etc., appear less
frequently in commodities and are far less reliable as to either direction or
extent  of  the  ensuing  move.  Support  and  Resistance  Levels,  as  we  have
already noted, are less potent in commodities than in stocks; sometimes they
seem to work to perfection, but just as often they don’t. For similar reasons,
gaps have relatively less technical signiﬁcance.

It is not the purpose of this book to explain the operation of commodity
futures markets, nor to offer instruction to those who wish to trade therein.
This brief chapter is included only as a starter for readers who may want to
pursue the study further. They should be advised that successful speculation
in  commodities  requires  far  more  specialized  knowledge,  demands  more
constant  daily  and  hourly  attention.  The  ordinary  individual  can  hope  to
attain a fair degree of success in investing in securities by devoting only his
spare moments to his charts, but he might better shun commodity specula-
tion entirely unless he is prepared to make a career of it.

Technical Analysis of 
Commodity Charts, Part 2 

A 21st Century Perspective

In the search for the Philosopher’s Stone more sweat and money have been
put  into  the  area  of  commodities  and  futures  than  were  ever  expended  in
the  securities  arena.  There  is  a  simple  reason  for  this.  Great  fortunes  are
made and lost with much greater rapidity in the futures area than in secu-
rities. Of all the great dramatic moments in stock market history few are so
memorable as the great Hunt silver market, or Soros facing off against the
Bank of England, or of gold soaring to $1000 an ounce. And the saga con-
tinues in 2005. $50 oil? $60? $70? $100? And the effects, economic and psy-
chological!  In  dimly  lit  garrets  and  brightly  lit  computer  rooms  thousands
of  researchers  concoct  systems  to  trade  these  markets  —  corn,  soybeans,
silver, copper...

Rocket  Scientists

At  times  individual  traders  and  groups  of  traders  have  plundered  (har-
vested?) these markets for fairy tale proﬁts. I know whereof I speak, having
been  a  principal  in  California’s  ﬁrst  licensed  commodity  trading  advisor
which was founded by the NASA rocket scientist R.T. Wieckowicz. During
the 1970s as the stock markets ground futilely around the 1000 level on the
Dow the futures markets returned yearly gains in the 100% range. Consis-
tently. For years. Those were the years of the California systems traders and
the beginning of computerized trading. From the primeval slime of NASA
the  rocket  scientists  emerged  to  create  a  renaissance  in  market  technology.
At  the  time  it  seemed  clear  that  science  and  genius  had  at  last  conquered
the markets and that clients would come buzzing from the world over like
bees  to  a  honey  pot  and  that  the  rivers  of  proﬁts  would  last  forever.  They
did last for some time, and then the markets changed. Mechanical systems
which cut through the markets like a reaper in a wheat ﬁeld in bull markets
grind up capital like sausage in sideways markets. Science and genius were
revealed as the happy combination of man, moment, system, and market.

Turtles?

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

During  the  1980s  from  the  sea  came  crawling  the  Turtles.  Progeny  of  the
protean trading wizard, Richard Dennis, the Turtles again harvested outsize
proﬁts from the markets, running it is said in the 80% yearly range. The so-
called  Turtles  got  their  name  from  a  comment  that  Dennis  is  reported  to
have made that traders were made not born and he was going to raise traders
like turtles. Additional reading about the Turtles is available in Jack Schwa-
et  al.  Schwager’s  books
ger’s  fascinating  book  and  books, 
are  required  reading  for  aspiring  traders.  And,  the  trading  manual  of  the
Turtles  will  be  found  in Appendix  E  of  this  ninth  edition.  This  workbook,
written by Curtis Faith, an original Turtle, contains virtually all of the ele-
ments necessary in a trader’s systems and procedures manual. The manual
was  prepared  according  to  the  training  Dennis  gave  his  Turtles.  Serious
traders  do  not  operate  without  some  such  document.  Certainly  all  of  the
serious traders I have known (a considerable number) have had fully devel-
oped manuals like the Turtle workbook. I have attached the Turtle workbook
as  an  appendix  rather  than  others  in  my  possession  because  it  is  publicly
available at originalturtles.org and because it is beautifully articulated.

Market  Wizards, 

In  the  late  ’90s  the  Turtles  were  made  into  turtle  soup  in  the  futures
markets as the majority of systems traders wound up as hamburger meat.
Is there a moral? Yes. The markets giveth and the markets taketh away. Science and
genius  are  again  revealed  to  be  the  happy  combination  of  man,  method,  moment,
and market.

The Turtle system is basically an adaptation of Richard Donchian’s chan-
nel breakout system. In the Donchian system the trader goes long when the
20 day high is broken and sells and goes short when the 20 day low is broken.
In  the  1970s  Dunn  and  Hargitt  evaluated  a  number  of  mechanical  trading
systems and found that Donchian’s system was superior to the others eval-
uated at that time. Will Donchian’s system still work? Yes, in broadly trend-
ing  markets.  Will  the  Turtle  system  still  work?  Yes,  in  broadly  trending
markets. And, like virtually all mechanical systems they don’t know whether
they  are  in  a  broadly  trending  market  or  not.  They  are  blind. All  they  see
are ones and zeros. The addition to these systems of prudently applied chart
analysis will immeasurably improve their performance and risk characteristics.

The Application of Edwards and Magee’s Methods 
to  21st  Century  Futures  Markets

During my career as a Commodity Trading Advisor I have known a number
of successful traders and advisors who used what I would describe as Magee
type  chart  analysis  to  make  their  trades.  Often  there  were  other  elements
input  into  their  decision  making  process,  but  manual  charting  was  a  key
factor in their operations. Some of these traders used simple trendline anal-
ysis with price or volume ﬁlters and some used a combination of trendlines
and support and resistance. 

All were trend followers.

Chapter 16.1: A 21st Century Perspective

309

Having looked at the futures markets with some attention over the past
several years it seems to me that there is no reason why chart analysis should
not  work  as  well  now  as  it  has  always  worked.  Essentially  the  questions
raised  by  securities  trading  are  the  same  as  those  presented  by  futures
trading in the analysis of a chart. Is there a trend? Where are support and
resistance? Is there a breakout? Are there waves and wavelets? How do you
enter and how do you exit?

The great bug-a-boo of securities traders coming to the futures trading
is  the  speed  of  the  game.  Like  college  football  players  stepping  up  to  the
NFL there is a brutal learning curve and rookies are the most likely to get
killed. I am not going to make any effort here to present a primer for new
futures traders. Rather I will look at some futures charts at the end of this
chapter in order to show the journeyman that chart analysis can be used as
a decision making method in these dramatic markets. Again, chart analysis
has the weakness (or strength) of being a qualitative process. It will not make
decisions for the average trader, as a mechanical system will.

On the other hand a breakout is a breakout. A gap is a gap, leaving aside
the question of limit move gaps for the moment. A trend is a trend. And here
is  the  great  advantage  that  a  ﬁrm  grasp  of  charting  methods  can  give  the

market at hand and choose to wait or to enter.
 Mechanical methods not having the
qualitative  discrimination  of  an  experienced  chartist  will  blindly  take  every
trade until they are out of money. The experienced chart analyst can sit back
and say, this market has not yet made a bottom and the time to begin trading
it long has not yet come. Or, he can recognize the essential differences between
a trading and a trending market and adjust his tactics accordingly.

As Magee noted in Chapter 16: 

Under  what  might  be  called  normal  market  conditions,  those
chart  patterns  which  reﬂect  trend  changes  in  most  simple  and
logical fashion work just as well with commodities as with stocks.
Among  these  we  would  list  Head-and-Shoulders  formations,
Rounding Tops and Bottoms, and basic trendlines. Trendlines, in
fact, are somewhat better deﬁned and more useful in commodities
than in stocks. Other types of chart formations which are associ-
ated with stocks with short-term trading or with group distribu-
tion  and  accumulation,  such  as  the  Triangles,  Rectangles,  Flags,
etc., appear less frequently in commodities and are far less reliable
as to either direction or extent of the ensuing move. Support and
Resistance  Levels,  as  we  have  already  noted,  are  less  potent  in
commodities  than  in  stocks;  sometimes  they  seem  to  work  to
perfection, but just as often they don’t. For similar reasons, gaps
have relatively less technical signiﬁcance.

These words remain true today, as do virtually all the principles enun-
ciated in this book by Edwards and Magee and myself. In fact most futures

charts  if  given  to  an  analyst  without  issue  identiﬁcation  and  dates  would
not be identiﬁable as commodity charts. Of course when limit moves appear
the  difference  slaps  one  in  the  face. And  on  this  point  I  might  differ  from
Magee  slightly  as  regards  gaps.  Obviously  limit  move  gaps  have  breath
taking signiﬁcance. But all in all it seems to me that gaps often say the same
thing to futures analysts that they say to stock analysts.

Another  mathematical  reason  might  be  adduced  for  the  practicality  of
using simple chart analysis to trade futures. That is the tautalogical nature of
the  method. A  trend  is  a  trend,  and  a  trendline  is  a  trendline.  If  you  enter  a
suspected trend (setting a protective stop at a technically analyzed place) and
follow the trend using Basing Points or observing the trendline and exiting on
a  break  and  reversal  there  will  be  no  difference  from  doing  the  same  with  a
stock.  Well,  some  difference.  Due  to  the  leverage  you  will  be  required  to  be
hyper aware of risk. In futures the penalty for holding a position through “a
normal reaction” can be extremely harsh. That is why stops are so important.

Stops

Some  traders  set  their  stops  using  money  management  rules  rather  than
technically identiﬁed points. I believe it is always better to ﬁnd the technical
point using a basing point, or support and resistance. To me it makes better
sense to adjust position size to control risk as I described in Chapter 26. And
the  use  of  money  management  stops  has  been  very  successful  for  many

not installed the trader is assured of failure.

A  money  management  stop  is,  simply  enough,  a  stop  calculated  by
deciding  to  risk  2%  (or  3  or  4  or  x%)  of  capital  on  a  trade.  For  example,
William O’Neil says that when a stock trader enters a position he should set
a stop 8% under his entry price. This is a little crude, and not strictly speaking
a money management stop, but is better than no risk calculation at all. In a
stricter sense, if we said that we wanted to limit the risk of the trade to 3%
of capital we would use the 8% rule to set the stop and the Scott Procedure
in  Chapter  26  to  determine  the  number  of  shares  or  contracts.  The  Turtle
system in Appendix E contains similar procedures. Numerous studies have
proven  that  the  size  of  the  risk  per  trade  —  1%,  2%,  3%  —  is  directly
correlated to equity volatility.

A Variety of Methods

As noted above a competent chart analyst may, in my opinion (and in Magee’s
opinion), perform proﬁtably in the futures markets. There are other questions,
of course, namely of character, temperament, intelligence, judgment, etc…, Let
us  leave  those  questions  to  Dr.  Elder  and  conﬁne  ourselves  to  the  method
question. Chart analysts proved their abilities in the futures markets long before
computers  existed.  In  fact  long  before  in  the  case  of  Japanese  rice  traders,
enlightening their efforts with candlesticks in the 18th century.

In the 1970s I saw point and ﬁgure chartists enjoy great success at Dean
Witter and Merrill Lynch and other major ﬁrms in futures. I have seen least
squares  curve  ﬁtters,  moving  average  calculators  and  abstruse  statistical
analysts  all  enjoy  proﬁtable  outings  in  commodities.  Not  to  speak  of  the
Turtles who, using naturalistic high low systems, harvested good proﬁts in
the markets. As the saying goes, gateless is the gate and many are the ways
to  the  great  Dow.  Although  I  have  enjoyed  great  success  myself  using
mechanical number-driven systems over the years I have become more and
more attracted to “natural” systems. Chart analysis is essentially natural, as
is the Turtle system. The Dow Theory is a natural system. In a natural system
no  mathematical  algorithm  comes  between  the  analyst  and  the  data.  The
essential,  more,  quintessential,  weakness  of  all  number-driven  systems  is
their  blindness.  They  do  not  have  the  ability  to  discriminate  between  the
 (and hear) the
forest and the trees. The experienced human chartist can 
changing rhythms of the market and respond to them, responding to factors
too  subtle  (and  even  subconscious)  to  program.  But  even  natural  systems,
like the Turtle systems, can fall into this trap. When the markets learn that
a lot of capital is waiting just above the 20 day high they will set a trap for
it. For “markets” you may read “they.” If you apply the knowledge of this
book to such situations you may avoid the trap.

as the leverage is 10 times greater the speed is 10 times faster. I have illus-

Otherwise  the  same  qualities  which  make  a  good  security  trader  make  a
good  futures  trader  once  the  great  leap  to  leveraged  quick-ﬁre  markets  is
made.  If  you  have  been  successful  trading  stocks  you  will  probably  be
successful trading futures. And you probably should practice on stocks while
studying  futures.  A  sobering  fact  which  I  often  recount  to  my  graduate
students is that Richard Wyckoff worked in the securities business for 8 years
before making his ﬁrst investment. He studied the markets an additional 6
years before

The  Magee  methodology  will  serve  as  a  valuable  cornerstone  of  your
futures operations, and you must never cease studying. Mechanical systems
have  their  attractions,  especially  when  seasoned  with  experienced  chart
analysis. And no method will survive unless practiced with diligence, per-
sistence,  judgment,  and  patience.  Time  and  again  you  will  hear  famous
traders say, when asked the secret of their success, “discipline.” What they
mean by discipline is their ability to measure and contain the risk, set a stop

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

The Return of the Great Markets of the ’70s

In the next great bull market in commodities, which may be about to occur
as  this  book  goes  to  press  in  2006  (cf.  following  charts  this  chapter),  these
methods  and  systems  derived  from  them  will  once  again  reap  windfall
proﬁts.

I  have  attempted  in  this  ninth  edition  of  this  classic  book  to  show  the
book’s  usefulness  to  the  intelligent  futures  trader.  Simple  classical  chart
analysis  alone  can  be  successful  in  the  futures  markets  in  the  hands  of  an
experienced  competent  analyst.  Natural  mechanical  systems  such  as  the
Turtle  system  have  been  effective  and  will  be  again,  perhaps  with  some
tweaking (such as imposing a chart analysis super-structure). Wave analysis
methods  such  as  the  Basing  Points  procedure  of  Chapter  28  can  be  used.
Even  number  driven  systems,  such  as  moving  averages,  can  be  successful
especially if combined with chart analysis.

completion of the pattern itself is apt to be slow and subject to frequent interruptions,
tiring out the impatient trader, but yielding eventually a substantial proﬁt.” So said
Robert Edwards in remarking on Rounding Bottoms in stock charts. As may be seen
here  this  Rounding  Bottom  consists  of  a  downtrend,  a  false  signal  off  the  Double
Bottom (upon which a pretty penny might have been made by the agile trader), and
a handsome uptrend. And it all looks like a huge Rounding Bottom.

Bunker Hunt are doing at present. A very cautious investor (like Warren Buffet who
is reported to be long $1B (billion) silver bullion) may defeat futures silver volatility
by buying the bullion.

FIGURE 179.5.3.
Silver May 2005. While the long-term silver outlook may be bull-
ish, the short term will be very volatile, especially for the thinly capitalized trader.
Then short-term tactics must be adopted. The island top here at 1 is a gentle invitation
to  the  trader  to  take  his  proﬁts  and  be  gone.  Even  to  short,  with  a  stop  just  above
the  high.  The  run  day  after  1  adds  a  note  of  urgency  to  the  invitation.  The  gap  is
punishment  for  the  hard  of  hearing  and  a  bonus  for  the  quick  witted  (everybody
who survives in futures is either quick witted or extremely well ﬁnanced). The stop
moves down to the top of the gap day, then to the top of the next gap day and for
the  very  apt  proﬁts  are  taken  on  the  next  run  day  down.  On  the  principle  of  sell
weakness, buy weakness. The tight trendline at 2 crossed by the heavy run day is a
buy signal with the stop moving to the bottom of the gap at 3 where it is taken out
a few days later by the long range day down. The run day at 4 is a short signal with
the stop being at the day’s high. Is it necessary to say that short-term futures trading
can be quite rapid? Or, there is always bullion. Or associated stock plays.

Treasury  Bonds.  The  double  pump  triple  nod  head  fake  is  a
specialty of futures markets. The fear and greed factor is multiplied by 10, like the
leverage. But here in September 2004 Bonds we can see how simple chart analysis
can serve the trader. The downtrend from March (1) is completely manageable with
a simple trendline and trend analysis. The end of the downtrend in May is marked
by two strong run days. At any rate the stop would have been at May 1st, using a
Basing Point kind of analysis. If we were going to trade it long here this would have
been traded for a scalp (because we don’t know whether there is a bottom or not).
The break of the trendline at 2 is an engraved invitation to get long and the trendline
at  3  keeps  us  long  until  broken  by  the  signal  day  at  the  end  of  July.  Which  would
put us short again, a two-day trade as the signal day on the trendline at 4 puts us
long again. Obviously we are using very tight, very short trendlines and long range
days  (or  run  days)  as  signals.  The  use  of  the  run  day  as  a  signal,  combined  with
other indicators, is common in my experience among traders.

runaway gap is somewhat quizzical — it might be considered a ﬂag, but it has the
same effect, and depending on the trader’s operating methods the stop would be just
under the gap/runday anyway. It will not take much study for the reader to see that
the principles of chart analysis used in this entire book are validated here. The main
difference is in the setting of stops, and in fact, the same stop methods may be used
if the trader is sufﬁciently well ﬁnanced.

much analysis of this 10 year CRB chart to see a huge double bottom, and to consider
its implications. If China and India are going to compete with us for natural resources
we could see an entirely new economic paradigm, if the reader will excuse the term.
Clearly  there  is  a  bull  market  in  commodities.  In  Chapter  42,  Pragmatic  Portfolio
Management,  it  is  suggested  that  capital  should  ﬂow  to  markets  that  are  moving,
rather  than  remaining  committed  to  markets  which  are  mired  in  mulish  trends.
Furthermore it is suggested in that chapter that a good natural hedge is to go long
the  uptrend  of  an  index  and  short  the  components  of  it  which  are  in  downtrends.
The CRB is somewhat thin but might lend itself to this strategy.

A Summary and Some 
Concluding Comments

philosophy

We  began  our  study  of  technical  stock  chart  analysis  in  Chapter 1  with  a
discussion of the 
 underlying the technical approach to the prob-
lems of trading and investing. We could ask that the reader turn back now
and review those few pages to recapture a perspective on the subject which
must have been dimmed by the many pages of more or less arduous reading
that have intervened.

It  is  easy,  in  a  detailed  study  of  the  many  and  fascinating  phenomena
which  stock  charts  exhibit,  to  lose  sight  of  the  fact  that  they  are  only  the
rather imperfect instruments by which we hope to gauge the relative strength
of  supply  and  demand,  which,  in  turn,  exclusively  determines  what  way,
how fast, and how far a stock will go.

Remember that, in this work, it doesn’t matter what creates the supply
and the demand. The fact of their existence and the balance between them
verbatim  et
are  all  that  count.  No  man,  no  organization  (and  we  mean  this 
literatim
)  can  hope  to  know  and  accurately  appraise  the  inﬁnity  of  factual
data,  mass  moods,  individual  necessities,  hopes,  fears,  estimates,  and
guesses  which,  with  the  subtle  alterations  ever  proceeding  in  the  general
economic  framework,  combine  to  generate  supply  and  demand.  But  the
summation  of  all  these  factors  is  reﬂected  virtually  instantaneously  in  the
market.

The technical analyst’s task, then, is to interpret the action of the market
itself  —  to  read  the  ﬂux  in  supply  and  demand  mirrored  therein.  For  this
task, charts are the most satisfactory tools thus far devised. Lest you become
enrapt,  however,  with  the  mechanics  of  the  chart  —  the  minutiae  of  daily
ﬂuctuations — ask yourself constantly, “What does this action really mean
in terms of supply and demand?”

Judgment is required, and perspective, and a constant reversion to ﬁrst
principles. A chart, as we have said and should never forget, is not a perfect
tool;  it  is  not  a  robot;  it  does  not  give  all  the  answers  quickly,  easily,  and
positively, in terms that anyone can read and translate at once into certain
proﬁt.

We  have  examined  and  tested  exhaustively  many  technical  theories,
systems, indexes, and devices which have not been discussed in this book,

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

chieﬂy because they tend to short-circuit judgment, to see the impossible by
a  purely  mechanical  approach  to  what  is  far  from  a  purely  mechanical
problem. The methods of chart analysis that have been presented are those
which have proved most useful, because they are relatively simple and, for
the most part, easily rationalized; because they stick closely to ﬁrst principles;
because  they  are  of  a  nature  that  does  not  lead  us  to  expect  too  much  of
them; because they supplement each other and work well together.

Let us review these methods brieﬂy. They fall roughly into four categories.

1. The Area Patterns or formations of price ﬂuctuation which, with their
concomitant volume, indicate an important change in the supply–de-
mand  balance.  They  can  signify  Consolidation,  a  recuperation  or
  as  the
gathering  of  strength  for  renewed  drive  in  the 
trend which preceded them. Or they can indicate Reversal, the play-
ing  out  of  the  force  formerly  prevailing,  and  the  victory  of  the  op-
. In either
posing force, resulting in a new drive in the 
case,  they  may  be  described  as  periods  during  which  energy  is
brewed or pressure built up to propel prices in a move (up or down)
which can be turned to proﬁt. Some of them provide an indication
as to how far their pressure will push prices. These chart formations,
together  with  volume,  furnish  the  technician  with  most  of  his  “get
in” and many of his “get out” signals.

reverse direction

same  direction

relative

Volume, which has not been discussed in this book as a feature
apart  from  price  action,  and  which  cannot,  in  fact,  be  utilized  as  a
technical guide by itself, deserves some further comment. Remember
that it is 
, that it tends to naturally run higher near the top of
a Bull Market than near the bottom of a Bear Market. Volume “follows
the  trend,”  i.e.,  it  increases  on  rallies  and  decreases  on  reactions  in
an overall uptrend, and vice versa. But use this rule judiciously; do
not place too much dependence on the showing of a few days, and
bear in mind that even in a Bear Market (except during Panic Moves),
there  is  always  a  slight  tendency  for  activity  to  pick  up  on  rises.
(“Prices can fall of their own weight, but it takes buying to put them
up.”)

A notable increase in activity, as compared with previous days or
weeks,  may  signify  either  the  beginning  (breakout)  or  the  end  (cli-
max)  of  a  move,  temporary  or  ﬁnal.  (More  rarely,  it  may  signify  a
“shakeout.”)  Its  meaning,  in  any  given  case,  can  be  determined  by
its relation to the price pattern.

2. Trend and trendline studies supplement Area Patterns as a means of
determining the general direction in which prices are moving and of
detecting changes in direction. Although lacking, in many cases, the
nice deﬁnition of Area Formations, they may frequently be used for
“get  in”  and  “get  out”  purposes  in  short-term  trading,  and  they
provide  a  defense  against  premature  relinquishment  of  proﬁtable
long-term positions.

Chapter seventeen: A Summary and Some Concluding Comments

323

3. Support  and  Resistance  Levels  are  created  by  the  previous  trading
and investment commitments of others. They may serve to indicate
where  it  should  pay  to  take  a  position,  but  their  more  important
technical  function  is  to  show  where  a  move  is  likely  to  slow  down
or end, and at what level it should encounter a sudden and important
increase in supply or demand.

Before entering a trade, look both to the pattern of origin for an
indication of the power behind the move, and to the history of Sup-
port–Resistance for an indication as to whether it can proceed with-
out  difﬁculty  for  a  proﬁtable  distance.  Support–Resistance  studies
are especially useful in providing “cash-in” or “switch” signals.
4. Broad market background, including the Dow Theory, should not be
scorned. This time-tested device designates the (presumed) prevail-
ing Major Trend of the market. Its signals are “late,” but, with all its
faults  (and  one  of  these  is  the  greatly  augmented  following  it  has
acquired in recent years, resulting in a considerable artiﬁcial stimu-
lation of activity at certain periods), it is still an invaluable adjunct
to the technical trader’s Toolkit.

The  general  characteristics  of  the  various  stages  in  the  stock  market’s
great Primary Bull and Bear cycles, which were discussed in our Dow Theory
chapters,  should  never  be  lost  to  view.  This  brings  us  back  to  the  idea  of
perspective
, which we emphasized as essential to successful technical analysis
at the beginning of our summary. That stock which does not, to some degree,
follow the Major Trend of the market as a whole is an extraordinary excep-
tion. More money has been lost by buying perfectly good stocks in the later
and most exciting phases of a Bull Market, and then selling them, perhaps
from necessity, in the discouraging conditions prevailing in a Bear Market,
than from all other causes combined!

So  keep  your  perspective  on  the  broad  market  picture.  The  basic  eco-
nomic  tide  is  one  of  the  most  important  elements  in  the  supply–demand
equation for each individual stock. It may pay to buck “the public,” but it
does not ever pay to buck the real underlying trend.

Major  Bull  and  Bear  Markets  have  recurred  in  fairly  regular  patterns
throughout all recorded economic history, and there is no reason to suppose
that they will not continue to recur for as long as our present system exists.
It is well to keep in mind that caution is in order whenever stock prices are
at  historically  high  levels,  and  that  purchases  will  usually  work  out  well
eventually when they are at historically low levels.

If  you  make  known  your  interest  in  your  charts,  you  will  be  told  that
the chart analyst (like the Dow theorist) is always late — that he buys after
prices have already started up, maybe not until long after the “smart money”
has completed its accumulation, and that he sells after the trend has unmis-
takably turned down. Partly true, as you have no doubt already discovered

One  of  the  most  successful  “operators”  Wall  Street  has  ever  seen,  a
multimillionaire and a nationally respected citizen today, is reputed to have
said  that  never  in  his  entire  career  had  he  succeeded  in  buying  within

And for perspective, the 5 points mentioned constituted

Before we leave this treatise on theory and proceed to the more practical
matters  of  application  and  market  tactics  which  are  the  province  of  the
second part of this book, the reader will, we hope, forgive one more admo-
nition. There is nothing in the science of technical analysis that requires one
always to have a position in the market. There is nothing that dictates that
something  must  happen  every  day.  There  are  periods  —  sometimes  long
months — when the conservative trader’s best policy is to stay out entirely.
And there is nothing in technical analysis to compel the market to go ahead
and  complete  (in  a  few  days)  a  move  that  the  charts  have  foretold;  it  will
take its own good time. Patience is as much a virtue in stock trading as in
any other human activity.

chapter 17.1

Technical Analysis and Technology 
in the 21st Century: 
The Computer and the Internet, 
Tools of the Investment/ 
Information Revolution

The purpose of this chapter is to put computer and information technology
into proper context and perspective for chart-oriented technical analysts.

In John Magee’s time, in his ofﬁce in Springﬁeld, MA, there was a chart
room — a room ﬁlled with all-age chartists from teenagers to senior citizens.
These  people  spent  all  their  time  keeping  charts  and  assisting  Magee  in
interpretation. These were wonderful and intelligent people who developed
marvelous  insights  into  the  stocks  they  charted.  They  created  the  manual
charts which adorn this book.

Today that room and all those technicians have been replaced by a beige
(sometimes lime) box which sits crowded on our desktops and which is often
worshipped  as  a  fount  of  insight  and  wisdom:  “Computer,  analyze  my
stocks.”

Unfortunately the computer does not have the discrimination and pat-
tern recognition ability of the people in that chart room. Undeterred by this
weakness in computer technology, traders and investors have poured incal-
culable  money  and  effort  into  computer-aided  research  attempting  to  dis-
cover the keys to market success. More money has been spent in this effort
than  was  ever  put  into  the  search  for  the  philosopher’s  stone.  Much  of  it
was wasted, but it has not all been spent in vain. In some areas it has been
quite  productive.  But  no  fail-safe  algorithm  has,  in  spite  of  all  this  effort,
been found for investment success, and certainly not for stock trading. The
has
  demonstrated  that  even  the  algorithm  of  “buy  low  sell  high”
research 
has fatal ﬂaws in it.

In order to fully understand the importance of the computer, the reader
should  appreciate  some  basic  differences  in  participants’  approach  to  the
markets. Or, we might say, schools of analysts/investors. We will not bother
with fundamental analysts here, as they are of a different religious persua-
sion. Chart analysts, or we could say, Magee-type technical analysts, pretty

much conﬁne their analysis of the market to the interpretation of bar charts.
(This does not mean that their minds must be closed to other inputs. On the
contrary — anything which works.) Another chart analyst school uses point
and ﬁgure charts, and another candlestick charts. Another breed of technical
analysts  takes  basic  market  data,  price  and  volume,  and  uses  them  as  the
input  to  statistical  routines  which  calculate  everything  from  moving  aver-
ages  to  mystically  designated  indicators  like  %R  or  Bollinger  Bands
(cf. Appendix  C).  These  are  called  statistical  or  number-driven  technical
analysts,  or  what  have  you,  attempt  to  invest  or  trade
analysts.  All  these
stocks  and  other  ﬁnancial  instruments  (not  including  options)  using  some
form of what is called technical analysis — that is they all take, as input to
their analysis, hard data, data which people cannot lie about, misrepresent,
and  manipulate,  unlike  the  data  which  are  input  to  fundamental  analysis
(earnings, cash ﬂow, sales, etc.).

Using number-driven or, if you will, statistical technical analysis, these
latter schools attempt, just as chart analysts do, to predict market trends and
trading opportunities. This can be more than a little difﬁcult since the stock
and  bond  markets  are  behavioral  markets.  That  is,  the  stock  markets  are
driven by human emotion, as perhaps the most important of many variables
inﬂuencing  price.  And  human  emotion  and  behavior,  its  manic  and  its
depressive elements, have not yet been quantiﬁed. But some chart analysts
believe that they can recognize it when they see it on the charts.

In  another  area,  the  computer  has  yielded  much  more  dramatic  and
proﬁtable results. But that is in a model-driven market, namely the options
markets. Quantitative analysts, those who investigate and trade the options
markets,  are  a  breed  apart  from  technical  analysts.  In  an  interesting  irony,
emotion-driven markets, the stock markets, are used as the basis for deriv-
atives,  or  options  whose  price  is  determined  largely  by  the  operation  of
Quantitative analysts believe, as does this editor,
algorithms called models.
that  the  options  markets  can  be  successfully  gamed  through  quantitative
analysis. Results of skilled practitioners indicate this belief is accurate.

Alas, life is not so simple for the simple stock trader. Stock prices having
nothing to do with mathematics, except for being expressed as natural num-
bers, are not susceptible to easy prediction as to their future direction. Not
even with Magee chart analysis or any other form of analysis — technical,
fundamental, or psychic. (From a theoretical point of view each trade made
based  on  a  chart  analysis  should  be  looked  at  as  an  experiment  made  to
conﬁrm a probability. The experiment is ended quickly if the trend does not
develop.) The fact that chart analysis is not mechanizable is important. It is
one reason chart analysis continues to be effective in the hands of a skilled
practitioner. Not being susceptible to mechanization, counter-strategies can-
not be brought against it, except in situations whose meaning is obvious to
everyone,  for  instance,  a  large  important  Support  or  Resistance  Level  or  a
glaringly  obvious  chart  formation.  These  days  everyone  looks  at  charts  to
trade  even  if  they  don’t  believe  in  their  use.  In  these  obvious  cases  some
market participants will attempt to push prices through these levels in order

to  proﬁt  from  volatility  and  confusion.  Indeed,  human  nature  has  not
changed much since Jay Gould and Big Jim Fisk.

When  these  manipulations  of  price  occur,  they  create  false  signals  —
bull and bear traps. Interestingly, the failure of these signals may constitute
a reliable signal in itself — but in the direction opposite to the original signal.

The Importance of Computer Technology

Of what use and importance then is this marvelous tool — the most inter-

described  in  the  following  discussion.)  If  the  computer  can’t  deﬁnitively
identify proﬁtable opportunities, what good is it?

Probably the most important function the computer has for the Magee
Analyst  is  the  automation  of  rote  detail  work.  Data  can  be  gathered  by
downloading from database servers. Charts can be called up in an instant.
Portfolio accounting and maintenance and tax preparation can be disposed
of with one hand while drinking coffee with the other. All in all this might
make it sound as though the computer is a great tool, but with a pretty dull
edge.  Not  strictly  true.  There  is  at  least  one  great  leap  forward  for  Magee
Analysts with this tool, leaving aside the rote drudgery it saves. This great
advantage is portfolio analysis. In 
, a complex portfolio
analysis  of  the  kind  used  by  professional  traders  (Blair  Hull  and  Options
Research Inc.) is illustrated. Even simpler portfolios of the average investor
can beneﬁt from the facilities afforded by most portfolio programs, either on
the net or in commercial software packages (locations and software identiﬁed
in 

Resources (Appendix D)

Resources

).

Another  advantage  is  the  ability  to  see  basic  data  displayed  in  many
different  forms:  point  and  ﬁgure  charts,  candlestick  charts,  close-only
charts —  these  are  prepared  in  the  ﬂick  of  an  eyelash,  and  may  indeed
contribute  to  understanding  the  particular  situation  under  the  magnifying
glass.  The  effortless  quantiﬁcation  of  some  aspects  of  analysis  may  be
useful — volume studies, for instance, and given the popularity of moving
averages,  seeing  the  50-  and  200-day  moving  averages  can  be  interesting.
These moving averages are considered signiﬁcant by many market partici-
pants — even fundamental analysts. The analysis of any of these should be
considered  in  relation  to  the  current  state  of  the  market  as  understood  by
the careful chart analyst.

But what about (the strangely named) stochastics, Bollinger Bands, %R,
MACD,  Moving  Averages  (plain  vanilla,  exponential,  crossover,  etc.),
price/volume  divergence,  RSI  (plain  vanilla  and  Wilder),  VP  Trend,  TCI,
OBV, Upper/Lower Trading Bands, ESA Trading Bands, and AcmDis? Well,
there  is  a  certain  whiff  of  alchemy  to  some  of  them,  and  some  have  some
usefulness  sometimes.  And,  all  systems  work  beautifully  at  least  twice  in
their lives: in research, and in huge monumental Bull Markets. These number
driven indicators are also the times when trading genius is most likely to be

discovered.  These  are  brieﬂy  explored  by  a  former  editor  in  Appendix  C.
EN9:  It  is  also  true,  as  I  have  said,  that  you  can  drive  a  nail  with  a  screwdriver.
And the inventor of a tool may be fabulously successful with it while its adopters
lose their assets.

It is also possible that the excess of technical information created by these
indicators  may  be  like  the  excess  of  fundamental  information  —  another
shell  to  hide  the  pea  under,  another  magician’s  trick  to  keep  the  investor
from seeing what is truly important, and what is necessary and sufﬁcient to
know to trade well. Perhaps the investor would be better off with a behav-
ioral model, since the markets are behavioral. Number-driven technical anal-
ysis can do many things, some like Dr. Johnson’s dog which walked on its
hind legs, but they cannot put the market in perspective. Only the human
mind  can  do  that.  Number-driven  models  after  all  do  not  consider  skirt
lengths, moon cycles, sun spots, the length of the economic cycle, the bullish

comment  written  before  the  market  crash  of  the  2000s
.  In  the  end,  the  human
brain is still the only organ capable of synthesizing all this quantitative and
qualitative  information  and  assessing  those  elements  which  cannot  be
reduced to ones and zeros. The educated mind is still the best discriminator
of patterns and their contexts.

Summary 1

The computer is a tool, a powerful tool, but a tool nonetheless. It is not an
intelligent  problem  solver  or  decision  maker.  We  use  a  mechanical  ditch
digger to dig a ditch, but not to ﬁgure out where the ditch should be.

The multitude of indicators and systems should be viewed with a skep-
tical eye and evaluated within the context of informed chart analysis. Some-
times  an  indicator  or  technique  will  work  for  one  user  or  its  inventor  but
strangely  mislead  the  chart  analyst  who  tries  to  use  it  —  or  buys  it,  even
based on a veriﬁed track record.

So the experienced investor keeps his methods and analysis simple until
he has deﬁnitive knowledge of any technique, method, or indicator he would
like  to  add  to  his  repertoire.  And,  most  of  all,  he  depends  on  his  own
observations  and  experience  to  evaluate  his  own  and  others  trading  tech-
niques.

Other Technological Developments of Importance 
to the Technical Magee Analyst and All Investors

The  computer  is  not  the  only  technological  development  of  interest  to  the
technical investor. A number of information revolution technologies need to
be put in perspective. These are, in broad categories, the Internet and all its
facilities, developments in electronic markets, and advances in ﬁnance and
investment theory and practice. This last is treated in Chapter 17.2.

329

Due to the enormous body of material on these subjects, no attempt will
be made to explore these subjects exhaustively, but the general investor will
be  given  the  information  he  needs  to  know  to  put  these  subjects  in  their
proper perspective. Resources will point the analyst to avenues for further
investigation if the need is felt.

But  ﬁrst  of  all,  are  there  any  technological  developments  of  whatever
sort which have made charting obsolete? No. Are there any developments
which have made trading a guaranteed success? No. The only sure thing is
that some huckster will claim to have a sure thing. Those who believe such
claims are the victims of their own naivete.

The Internet — the Eighth Wonder of the Modern World 
(EN9: Resources Appendix for the 9th Edition has been 
enormously expanded and is of paramount importance to 
modern investors.)

The  Internet  has  been  called  the  most  complex  project  ever  built  by  man.
And that is probably true. Complex, sprawling, idiosyncratic, it has some-
thing for everyone, especially the investor. Every form of investment creature
known to man has set up a site on the Internet, and waits like the hungry
arachnid for the casual surfer. Brokers. Advisors — technical and fundamen-
tal.  Newspapers.  News  magazines.  Newsgroups.  Touts.  Mutual  funds.
Mutual  fund  advisories.  Critics  and  evaluators  of  all  the  above.  Database
vendors.  Chat  rooms.  Electronic  marketplaces  and  exchanges.  ECNs.  The
only unﬁlled niche that seems to exist is investment pornography. Perhaps
naked options will be able to satisfy this need.

This is a bewildering array of resources. How does one sort them out?
The implications of all this for the electronic or cyberinvestor may be further
expanded  to  indicate  the  services  and  facilities  available:  quotes  and  data;
portfolio management and accounting; online interactive charting; automatic
alerts  to  PBDAs  (personal  body  digital  assistants  or  gizmos  carried  on  the
body,  e.g.,  cell  phone  and  handheld  computer,  etc.);  analysis  and  advice;
electronic boardrooms; electronic exchanges where trading takes place with-
out intermediaries. 
 supplies speciﬁcs on these cate-
gories. This chapter supplies perspective. It is one thing to contemplate this
cornucopia of facilities and another thing to appreciate the importance and
priority  of  its  elements.  What  good  are  real  time  quotes  if  you  are  only
interested in reviewing your portfolio once a week, except for special occa-
sions? What good are satellite alerts and virtual reality glasses to a long-term
investor?  It  is  easy  for  the  investor  with  no  philosophy  or  method  to  be
drawn into the maelstrom of electronic wonders and stagger out of it little
wiser and much poorer.

an  electronic  broker,  or  even  a  nonvirtual  broker  who  communicates  via
telephone. And shortly, if not already, an electronic pit where one matches
wits with a computer instead of a market maker or specialist.

How long brokers will be necessary is a question that is up in the air in
the  new  century.  (The  broker  who  earns  his  keep  will  always  be  with  us,
and  welcome,  too.)  Electronic  marketplaces  where  investors  meet  without
the necessity of a broker or specialist are already proliferating (see 
),
and will continue to gain the advantage for the investor over the trading pit,
which is one of the last remaining edges the professionals hold over off-ﬂoor
traders. Sufﬁce it to say that their initial phases will undoubtedly be periods
of dislocation, of risk and opportunity as their glitches are ironed out. 

Resources

Placing  electronic  orders,  whether  to  an  electronic  exchange  or  to  the
NYSE, has certain inherent advantages over oral orders. No one can quarrel
about a trade registered electronically as opposed to orally where the poten-
tial for disagreement exists. In addition, the trader has only handled the data
once — rather than making an analysis, calling a broker, recording the trade,
passing it to the portfolio. If he just hits the trade button and the transaction
is  routed  through  his  software  package,  no  one  will  have  any  doubt  as  to
where an error might lie. The manual method presents an opportunity for
error  at  each  step. And  rest  assured,  errors  occur  and  can  be  disastrous  to
trading.

The  efﬁciency  and  ease  of  the  process  with  a  computer  has  much  to
recommend  it  —  automation  of  trade  processing,  elimination  of  confusion
and  ambiguities,  audit  tracks,  automation  of  portfolio  maintenance,  and,
perhaps  most  important  of  all,  automatic  mark-to-market  of  the  portfolio.

value whether trades are open or closed.)

two sets of books in the head — one recording proﬁts, open and closed, and
another recording losses, but only closed losses. Open losses were not losses
until  booked.  Having  an  electronic  portfolio  accountant  which  refuses  to
participate in such self-deception has much to recommend it. If the portfolio
is always marked to the market when the computer communicates with the
data vendor, or the trade broker, it is difﬁcult not to see red ink, and to see
that the equity of the account reﬂects all trades, open and closed.

Summary 2

Never  in  the  history  of  the  markets  have  so  many  facilities  for  private
investors  been  available.  The  computer  is  necessary  to  take  advantage  of
those facilities.

Data may be acquired automatically via Internet or dial-up sites at little

or no cost.

A  (as  they  say)  plethora  of  web  sites  offer  cyberinvestors  everything
from  portfolio  accounting  to  alerts  sent  to  their  personal  body-carried
devices (pagers, handheld PDAs, etc.).

Some  of  these  even  offer  real-time  data,  which  is  a  way  for  the  unso-

phisticated trader to go broke in real time.

Many of these sites offer every kind of analysis from respectable tech-

nical analysis (usually too complicated) to extraterrestrial channeling.

2. Give the analyst virtually effortless portfolio accounting and mark-

Advancements in 
Investment Technology

Part 1. Developments in Finance Theory and Practice

Numerous  pernicious  and  useless  inventions,  services,  and  products  litter
the  Internet  and  the  ﬁnancial  industry  marketplace;  but  modern  ﬁnance
theory  and  technology  is  important  and  must  be  taken  into  consideration
by the general investor. This chapter will explore the minimum the moder-
ately advanced investor needs to know about advances in theory and prac-
tice. And it will point the reader to further resources if he desires to continue
more advanced study.

Instruments of limited (or non-) availability during the time of Edwards
and Magee included exchange traded options on stocks, futures on averages
and indices, options on futures and indices, securitized indices and averages,
as the most important and as a partial list only. Undoubtedly one of the most
important developments of the modern era is the creation of trading instru-
ments  which  allow  the  investor  to  trade  and  hedge  the  major  indexes.  Of
these, the instruments created by the Chicago Board of Trade are of singular

Options

From the pivotal moment in 1973 when Fischer Black and his partner, Myron
Scholes, published their — excuse the usage — paradigm-setting Model to
the  third  millennium,  the  options/derivatives  markets  have  grown  from
negligible  to  trillions  of  dollars  a  year.  The  investor  who  is  not  informed
about options is playing with half a deck. The subject, however, is beyond
the  scope  of  this  book,  which  hopes  only  to  offer  some  perspective  on  the
subject and guides to the further study necessary for most traders and many
investors.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Something in the neighborhood of 30% or more of options expire worth-
less. This is probably the most important fact to know about options. (There
is a rule of thumb about options called the 60–30–10 rule: 60% are closed out
before expiration, 10% are exercised, and 30% are “long at expiration,” mean-
ing they are worthless.) Another fact to know about options is: in the Reagan
Crash  of  1987,  out  of  the  money  puts  bought  at  $.625  on  October  16  were
worth hundreds of dollars on October 19 — if you could get the broker to
pick  up  the  telephone  and  trade  them.  (The  editor  had  a  client  at  Options
Research,  Inc.  during  that  time  who  lost  $57MM  in  3 days  and  almost
brought down a major Chicago bank. He had sold too many naked puts.)

The most sophisticated and skilled traders in the world make their livings
(quite sumptuous livings, thank you) trading options. Educated estimates have
been  made  that  as  many  as  90%  of  retail  options  traders  lose  money.  That
combined with the fact that by far it is the general public which buys (rather
than sells) options should suggest some syllogistic reasoning to the reader.

With these facts ﬁrmly ﬁxed in mind, let us put options in their proper
perspective for the general investor. Options have a number of useful func-
tions. They offer the trader powerful leverage. With an option he can control
much more stock than by the direct purchase of stock — his capital stretches
much further. So options are an ideal speculative instrument. (Exaggerated
leverage  is  almost  always  a  characteristic  of  speculative  instruments.)  But
they can also be used in a most conservative way — that is, as an insurance
policy. For example, a position on the long security side may be hedged by
the purchase of a put on the option side. (This is not a speciﬁc recommen-
dation to do this. Every speciﬁc situation should be evaluated by the prudent
investor as to its monetary consequences.)

played

The experienced investor may also use options to increase yield on his
portfolio of securities. He may write covered calls, or write naked puts on
a stock in order to acquire it at a lower cost (e.g., he sells out of the money
options. This is a way of being long with the stock. If the stock comes back
to the exercise price, he acquires the stock. If not, he pockets the premium.)
There  are  numerous  tactics  of  this  sort  which  may  be  played  with
options.  Note, 
.  Played  because,  for  the  general  investor,  the  options
game can be disastrous, as professionals are not playing. They are seriously
practicing skills the amateur can never hope to master. Many ﬂoor traders,
indeed, would qualify as idiot savants — they can compute the “fair value”
of options in their heads and make money on price anomalies of $.625, or,
as  they  call  it,  a  “teenie.”  For  perspective,  the  reader  may  contemplate  a
conversation the editor had with one of the most important options traders
in  the  world.  This  market  maker  remarked  casually  that  his  fortune  was
built  on  teenies.  The  reader  may  imagine  at  some  length  what  would  be
necessary for the general investor to make a proﬁt on $.625.

This does not mean the general investor should never touch options. It
just means he should be thoroughly prepared before he goes down to play
that  game.  In  options  trading  traders  speak  of  bull  spreads,  bear  spreads,

and alligator spreads. The alligator spread is an options strategy which eats
the customer’s capital 

in toto
.

Among these strategies is covered call writing. This is a strategy which
is  touted  as  being  an  income  producer  on  a  stock  portfolio.  There  is  no
purpose in writing a call on a stock in which the investor is long — unless
that  stock  is  stuck  in  a  clear  congestion  phase  which  is  not  due  to  expire
before  the  option  expires. And  if  the  stock  is  in  a  downtrend  it  should  be
liquidated. But to write a call on a stock in a clear uptrend is to make oneself
beloved of the broker, whose good humor improves markedly with account
activity and commission income. The outcome of a covered call on an ascending
stock, of course, is that the writer (you, dear reader) has the stock called at the
exercise price, losing his position and future appreciation, not to mention costs.
The  income  is  actually  small  consolation,  a  sort  of  booby  prize  —  a  way  of
cutting your proﬁts while increasing your costs.

Quantitative Analysis

The investor should be aware of another area of computer and investment
technology that has yielded much more dramatic and proﬁtable results, but
that is in a model-driven market — namely the options markets. Quantitative
analysts, those who investigate and trade the options markets, are a breed
apart  from  technical  analysts.  In  an  interesting  irony,  behavioral  markets,
the  stock  markets,  are  used  as  the  basis  for  derivatives,  or  options  whose
price  is  determined  largely  by  the  operation  of  algorithms  called  models.
The original model which for all intents and purposes created the modern
world  of  options  trading  was  the  Black–Scholes  options  analysis  model,
which  assumed  that  the  “fair  value”  of  an  option  could  be  determined  by
entering ﬁve parameters into the formula: the strike price of the option; the
price of the stock; the “risk free” interest rate; the time to expiration; and the
volatility of the stock.

The eventual universal acceptance of this model resulted in the deriva-
tives  industry  we  have  today.  To  list  all  the  forms  of  derivatives  available
for  trading  today  would  be  to  expand  this  book  by  many  pages,  and  it  is
not the purpose of this book anyway. The purpose of this paragraph of the
book is to sternly warn general investors who are thinking of “beating the
derivatives  markets”  that  they  should  undergo  rigorous  training  ﬁrst.  The
alternative could be extremely expensive.

At ﬁrst the traders who saw the importance of this model and used it
to price options virtually skinned older options traders and the public, who
traded pretty much by the seat of the pants or the strength of their convic-
tions, meaning human emotion. But professional losers learn fast, and now
all competent options traders use some sort of model or antimodel, or anti-
antimodel to trade. And true to form, options sellers, who are largely pro-
fessionals, take most of the public’s (who are buyers) money. This is the way
of the world.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Options Pricing Models and Their Importance

After the introduction of the Black–Scholes Model numerous other models
followed, among them the Cox–Ross–Rubinstein, the Black Futures, etc. For
the general investor, the message is this: he must be acquainted with these
models and what their functions are if he intends to use options. Remember
that the model computes the “fair value” of the option. One way profession-
als  make  money  off  amateurs  is  by  selling  overpriced  options  and  buying
underpriced options to create a relatively lower risk spread (for themselves).
Not  knowing  what  these  values  are  for  the  private  investor  is  like  not
knowing where the present price is for a stock. It is a piece of ignorance for
which  the  professional  will  charge  him  a  premium  to  be  educated  about.
Unfortunately, many private options traders never get educated in spite of
paying tuition over and over again. But ignorance is not bliss. It is expensive.
Technology and knowledge works its way from innovators and creative
geniuses through the ranks of professionals and sooner or later is dissemi-
nated to the general public. Of course by that time the innovators have devel-
oped  new  technology.  Nonetheless,  even  assuming  that  professionals  have
superior tools and technology, the general investor must thoroughly educate
himself before using options. As it is not the province of this book to dissect
options trading, the reader may ﬁnd references in 

Resources (Appendix D)

Here it would not be untoward to mention one of the better books on
options  as  a  starting  point  for  the  moderately  advanced  and  motivated
trader.  Lawrence  McMillan’s

Exchange, the CBOE, at www.cboe.com, which has tutorial software.

Options  as  a  Strategic  Investment

Futures on Indexes

Futures, like options, offer the speculator intense leverage — the ability to
control a comparatively large position with much less capital than the pur-
chase of the underlying commodity or index. Futures salesmen are fond of
pointing out the fact that, if you are margined at 5% or 10% of the contract
value, a similar move in the price of the index will double your money. They
are often not so conscientious about pointing out that a similar move against
your  position  will  wipe  out  your  margin  (actually  earnest  money).  Unlike
(long)  options,  a  mishap  in  the  market  can  result  in  more  than  the  loss  of
margin. It can result in a deﬁcit account and debts to the broker — in other
words,  losses  of  more  than  100%.  For  this  among  other  reasons,  it  is  wise
not to plunge into futures without considerable preparation.

This  preparation  might  well  begin,  for  the  adroit  investor,  with  the

But let us say that instead of using futures to speculate that we want

than speculating. As an oversimpliﬁed example, the investor might see the
failure of the DJIA to break through a top as the beginning of a congestion
zone (a consolidation or reversal pattern). He could then hedge his position
by shorting the Dow–Jones futures. Now he is both long and short — long
the cash, short the futures. He would place a stop on the futures above his
purchase price to close the trade if the market continued rising. If the market
fell,  he  would  maintain  the  futures  position  until  he  calculated  that  the
reaction  had  passed  its  worst  point,  or  until  it  were  deﬁnitely  analyzed  to
have reversed. He would then take his proﬁts on the futures position (tax-
able)  but  his  cash  position  would  be  intact,  and  presumably  the  greater
capital gains on those positions would be safe from taxation, and also safe
from the costs and slippage and difﬁculties of reestablishing the stock position.

Options on Futures and Indexes

Conservative as well as speculative use may be made of options. For exam-
ple,  the  investor  might,  after  a  vigorous  spike  upwards,  feel  that  the  S&P
500,  or  the  SPDRs  which  he  is  long,  were  overbought.  He  might  then  buy
an index put on the S&P as a hedge against the expected decline. If it occurs,
he  collects  his  proﬁt  on  the  option  and  his  cash  position  in  the  S&P  is
undisturbed. If the Index continues to climb he loses the option premium —
an insurance policy he took out to protect his stock portfolio.

  The  tactics  described  here  are  for  the  reader’s  conceptual

facilities of this kind, and the investor may also build on his own computer
a research or paper trading portfolio segregated from his actual transactions.
The trader might also choose to buy an option on a future. At the CBOT,
the trader can trade both options and futures on the DJIA. These can be used
as  the  above  examples  for  speculating  or  hedging,  except  in  this  case  the
successful  option  buyer  might  wind  up  owning  a  futures  contract  instead
of the cash position. This could be disconcerting to one not accustomed to
the futures market, especially if large price anomalies between futures and
cash  occurred,  as  happened  in  1987  and  1989  when  futures  prices  went  to
huge discounts to cash. A primary reason for employing the futures would
be for leverage. And the reason for using the options on futures would be
the  analysis  that  uncertainty  was  in  store  and  the  wish  to  only  risk  the
amount of the options premium.

Obviously, a speculator can choose to forget the stock or futures part of
the  portfolio  and  trade  only  options.  Before  taking  such  a  step  the  trader
should  pass  a  postgraduate  course.  The  proportion  of  successful  amateur
option traders to successful professional traders is extremely skewed. In fact
one might say that all successful options traders are professionals.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
MPT is a procedure and process whereby a portfolio manager may classify and
analyze the components of his portfolio in such a way as to, hopefully, be aware
of and control risk and return. It attempts to quantify the relationship between
risk and return. Rather than analyzing only the individual instruments within
a portfolio, MPT attempts to determine the statistical relationships among the
members of the portfolio and their relationships to the market.

The  processes  involved  in  MPT  analysis  are  (1)  portfolio  valuation,  or
describing  the  portfolio  in  terms  of  expected  risk  and  expected  return;
(2) asset  allocation,  determining  how  capital  is  to  be  allocated  among  the
classes of instruments (bonds, stocks, etc.); (3) optimization, or ﬁnding the
trade-offs between risk and return in selecting the components of the port-
folio; and (4) performance measurement, or the division of each stock’s risk
into systematic and security-related classes.

How important is this for the general investor? Not very. And there is
a  large  question  among  pragmatic  analysts,  such  as  the  editor,  as  to  its
pragmatic usefulness for professionals, although they cling to it as to a life
ring in a shipwreck. Mandelbrot observed in articles (“A Multifractal Walk
  (February  1999  and
Down  Wall  Street”)  and  letters  in  the 
June 1999) that MPT discards about 5% of statistical experience as if it didn’t
exist.  (Although  it  [the  experience]  does.) And  he  observed  that  the  ignored
experience includes “10 sigma” market storms which are blamed for portfolio
failures as though it is the fault of the data instead of the fault of the process.

Part 2. Futures and Options on Futures on the Dow–Jones

methods and techniques described in this chapter are 
for advanced practitioners. Careless use of the described 
instruments can be extremely damaging to a portfolio.)

Investment and Hedging Strategies Using the Chicago Board 
of Trade DJIA

 Futures Contract

SM

A  futures  contract  is  the  obligation  to  buy  or  sell  a  speciﬁc  commodity  on
or by some speciﬁed date in the future. For example, if one went long corn
futures  he  would  be  obligated  to  accept  delivery  of  corn  on  the  delivery
date,  unless  he  sold  the  contract  prior  to  the  settlement  date.  Shorting  the
contract would obligate the seller to deliver corn unless he offset (by repur-
chase)  the  contract.  The  “commodity”  in  our  present  case  is  the  basket  of
stocks represented by the DJIA Futures index. All futures contracts specify
the date by which the transaction must conclude, known as the “settlement
date,” and how the transaction will be implemented, known as “delivery.”
The  DJIA  futures  contract  price  closely  tracks  the  price  of  the  Dow  Jones
Industrials as computed from stock market values.

The  value  of  the  future  is  found  by  multiplying  the  index  price  of  the
futures contract by $10. For example, if the futures index price is 10000, the
value of the contract is 10000 
 $10 = $100,000. So the buyer or seller of the
futures  contract  is  trading  approximately  $100,000  worth  of  stocks  at  that
Dow  Futures  level.  The  value  may  be  higher  or  lower  owing  to  several
factors, for example, cost of carry, which I will discuss below.

⋅

Settlement of Futures Contracts

All futures contracts must be “settled.” Some futures are settled by delivery.
This is the famous nightmare of ﬁnding 5000 bushels of soybeans delivered
on your front lawn. Dow Index futures “settle” (are delivered) in cash. The
short does not dump a basket of Dow stocks on the yard of the long. Thus
on  the  settlement  date  of  the  contract  the  settlement  price  is  $10  times  a
ﬁgure called the “Special Opening Quotation,” a value calculated from the
opening prices of the member stocks of the Dow Future following the last
day  of  trading  in  the  futures  contract.  This  value  is  compared  to  the  price
paid for the contract when the trade initiated. For example, if the Dow Future
is 10000 at expiration, a long who bought the contract at 9000 receives $10,000
($10 

 1000) from the short.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Marking to Market

This $10,000, however, is paid daily over the life of the contract, rather than
in one payment upon expiration of the contract. It is paid as successive daily
“margin” payments. These payments are not really margin, but are in effect
“earnest  money”  or  a  performance  bond. And  the  practice  of  squaring  up
accounts  at  the  end  of  every  day’s  trading  is  called  “marking  to  market.”
These daily payments are determined based on the difference between the
previous day’s settlement price and the contract settlement price at the close
of trading each day.

As a practical example, if the settlement price of June Dow Index futures
increases  from  9800  to  9840  from  May  17  to  May  18,  the  short  pays  $400
⋅
 40)  and  the  long’s  account  is  credited  $400.  If  the  futures  settlement
($10 
price decreases 10 points the following day, the long pays $100 to the short’s
account  —  and  so  on  each  day  until  expiration  of  the  contract,  when  the
futures price and the index price achieve parity.

At any time the trader can close his position by offsetting the contract,
that  is,  by  selling  to  close  an  open  long,  or  buying  to  close  an  open  short.
At the expiration date open contracts are settled in cash at the ﬁnal settlement
price.

Fungibility

One  of  the  great  contributions  of  the  great  established  exchanges  like  the
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is their insti-
tutionalization of contract terms and relationships. This, of course, is “fun-
gibility.” Any one futures contract for corn, or an Index, or any other com-
modity  is  substitutable  for  another  of  the  same  commodity.  Similarly,  the
Exchange has negated counterparty risk by placing a Clearing Corporation
between all parties to trades. So even if the other party to a trade went broke,
the Clearing Corporation would assume his liability. And, using the mech-
anism of daily settlement, whereby losers pay winners daily, the danger of
major default is avoided.

Futures “margins” (or “earnest money”) are deposited with the broker
on  opening  a  trade.  The  leverage  obtainable  is  quite  extreme  for  a  stock
trader. Initial margin is usually 3–5% of the total value of the contract. Each
day  thereafter  margins  vary  according  to  the  process  described  above  of
marking to market.

As the reader can easily see, the purchase or sale of a Dow Future is the
equivalent of a fairly large portfolio transaction, with the understanding that
it is a transaction which must be closed in the future, unlike a stock purchase
which may be held indeﬁnitely.

Differences between Cash and Futures

The main two differences between the cash and the futures transactions are

1.

In cash, the value of the portfolio must be paid up front, or ﬁnanced
in a stock margin account.

2. The owner of the cash portfolio receives cash dividends.

These are not the only differences of course. The leverage employed in
the futures transaction is a two-edged sword. If the trader has no reserves,
a  minor  move  in  the  index  wipes  him  out.  Such  a  minor  move  would  be
barely noticed by the owner of a cash portfolio.

Dow Index Future

The  price  of  the  future  and  the  price  of  the  index  are  closely  linked  (cf.
Figure 199.1). Any price anomaly is quickly corrected by arbitragers. On any
signiﬁcant price difference, arbitragers will buy the underpriced and sell the
overpriced, bringing the relationship back in line. Their prices are not exactly
the same because the futures contract value must reﬂect the costs of short-
term ﬁnancing of stocks and the dividends paid by index stocks until futures
expiration. This is known as the “cost of carry.” The “theoretical value” of
the future should equal the price of the index plus the carrying cost. This is
what is called the “fair” or “theoretical” value.

Using Stock Index Futures to Control Exposure to the Market

The  owner  of  a  cash  portfolio  in  the  Dow,  or  of  DIAMONDS,  can  control
his  exposure,  his  risk,  by  using  futures  to  hedge.  If,  for  example,  he  is
pessimistic  about  the  market,  or  more  to  the  point,  a  lot  of  uptrend  lines
have been broken and the technical situation seems to be deteriorating, he
can sell a futures contract equivalent to his portfolio and be ﬂat the market.
Readers will immediately recognize the advantages of this strategy. Tax
consequences  on  the  cash  portfolio  are  avoided,  as  are  the  other  negative
consequences  of  trading  —  slippage,  errors,  etc.  Long-term  positions  are
better left alone. By ﬂattening his position the investor has now insured the
future  value  of  his  portfolio 
  the  capital  involved  is  now  earning  the
money market rate of return.

and

What  happens  if  the  forecast  market  decline  occurs?  The  portfolio  is
protected from loss, and the capital earns the market rate of return. 
 the
investor should monitor his hedge closely, lifting it when he calculates that
the  correction  has  run  its  course.  Taxes  will,  of  course,  then  be  due  on  the
proﬁts on the hedge.

And

In  monitoring  the  hedge,  the  possibility  must  be  considered  that  the
market rises instead of falling. In planning the hedge in the ﬁrst place, the
investor must plan for this eventuality and determine where he will lift the
hedge on the losing side. At worst, of course, the investor has surrendered
portfolio appreciation. Not considering cash ﬂow implications, of course.

It  is  worth  emphasizing,  in  fact

niques require knowledge, expertise, and study. Careless use of techniques

Diamonds and Futures. The 2% plus break at the arrow of an 11-
month trendline is an unmistakable invitation to hedge the DIAMONDS by shorting
the  futures.  Proﬁts  on  the  short  would  have  offset  losses  in  the  DIAMONDS.  This
convenient drill would have preserved liquidity, postponed capital gains taxes and
avoided loss of equity. Notice the return to the trendline after the break. More of the
foolish virgin syndrome?

of this nature can bloody the amateur investor. So it is probably best to have
a professional guide for the ﬁrst several of these expeditions, and to execute
a number of paper transactions ﬁrst.

The canny investor can increase his exposure to the market and the risk
to his capital by buying index futures. But the canny investor must be careful
not to turn into a burned speculator. Futures trading, because of the extreme
leverage, is an area for dedicated and experienced speculators.

A  Dow  Futures  transaction  costs  less  than  if  you  had  to  buy  or  sell  a
whole  basket  of  stocks.  Professional  fund  managers  —  as  well  as  other
professionals  —  regularly  use  futures  for  asset  allocation  and  reallocation.
In all likelihood, they are not using the extreme leverage afforded by futures.
In other words, if they have a million dollar cash portfolio, they don’t buy
10 million dollars worth of futures. It is not the leverage they are interested
in,  but  the  extreme  convenience  and  agility  offered  by  doing  short-term
allocations in futures. The ability to almost instantaneously move in and out
of  the  market  without  disturbing  the  underlying  portfolio  is  a  powerful
feature of these “proxy markets.”

Investment Uses of Dow Index Futures

In  the  following  examples,  I  describe  the  basic  mechanics  of  using  Dow
Futures contracts. These can be used to adjust equity exposure in anticipation
of  volatile  market  cycles  and  to  rebalance  portfolios  among  different  asset

classes. The futures may also be used for other purposes not illustrated here.
The following examples are not intended to be absolutely precise, but only
to  illustrate  the  mechanics  involved.  For  the  sake  of  simplicity,  mark-to-
market payments and cost of carry have been eliminated from the examples.

Situation 1: Portfolio Protection

circa  anno

You are a long-term Magee-type investor and you have old and proﬁtable
positions  with  which  you  are  satisﬁed.  But  you  have  seen  the  broadening
top  of  the  Dow  Jones  (
  2000)  and  it  is  almost  October  and  you
would not be surprised to see a little bloodshed. You have $400,000 in the
Dow and $100,000 in money market instruments. You decide to reverse this
ratio. But you don’t want to liquidate the Dow portfolio, as there is no sign
of a conﬁrmed downtrend, only that of consolidation. So you sell $300,000
of  index  futures,  leaving  yourself  with  a  $100,000  kicker  in  case  you  are
wrong  about  the  market’s  declining. At  the  time,  the  market  is  10000  and
the  futures  are  10500,  meaning  the  cost  of  carry  is  approximately  0.5%
(10,500/10,000 – 1).

You sell three futures contracts ($300,000/($10 

⋅
 10,000)). You now have
reversed your position and are long $100,000 Dow stocks and long $400,000
money market equivalents.

Validating  your  technical  analysis,  the  market  has  begun  to  swing  in
broad undulations and, at the expiration of the futures, the Dow is at 10000.
On your stocks you have a return of –0.5%, and the money market position
has a rate of return of 0.5%.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Without  the  futures  transaction,  the  portfolio  is  worth  $480,500.  The
$15,000 proﬁt on the short futures position offsets the loss on the $300,000
of the portfolio that was moved out of equities by the short futures position.
In  brief,  by  selling  futures,  you  are  able  to  protect  $300,000  of  your  initial
portfolio value from a stock price decline, nearly breaking even, an achieve-
ment given these market conditions. Of course, had you been more conﬁdent
of the market decline, you might have completely neutralized the equity risk
on the portfolio by selling more futures contracts. This would have converted
the entire stock position to a $400,000 investment in the money market. The
amount of protection you should obtain depends on your assessment of the
market and your tolerance for risk.

Situation 2: Increasing Exposure with Futures

Now  let  us  look  at  the  other  side  of  the  coin.  The  market  has  come  off  its
highs in a predictable and controlled secondary reaction and your technical
analysis  is  that  the  Bull  Market  will  continue. At  10000,  it  appears  headed
for 11000 and you want to increase your commitment. Your portfolio is as
previously described, split 80/20 between Dow stocks and money markets.
It is time to go whole hog, you decide. You are acutely aware of the market
maxim  that  bulls  make  money  and  bears  make  money  and  hogs  wind  up
slaughtered, but there is also a market maxim that no market maxim is true
100% of the time, which is also true of this maxim.

Rather than liquidate your money market holdings, you buy one futures
contract, which puts you long another $100,000 of stocks. The rate of return
on the money markets in your portfolio is 0.5%. To get a $500,000 exposure
in  blue  chips,  you  buy  the  following  number  of  contracts:  $100,000/($10  ⋅
10000) = 1 contract.

Results: Your technical analysis of the direction of the market is correct,
and the Dow Future rises to 11000 at the September expiration, or by 10%.

In buying Dow Index futures, you are able to “equitize” $100,000 of your
money market investment, effectively increasing your return from the money
market  rate  of  0.5%  to  10%.  If  you  had  not  bought  futures,  the  total  value
of  your  portfolio  at  the  September  expiration  would  have  been  $540,500
instead  of  $550,500.  Not  only  do  you  have  a  $10,000  extra  gain  in  your
portfolio, but you have taken advantage of the market’s continuing upward
climb without having to adjust your portfolio. 

Situation 3: Using Bond and Index Futures for Asset Allocation
Speculation  in  bonds  can  be  quite  proﬁtable  notwithstanding  David
Dreman’s assertion that long-term investments in bonds are net losers. (EN9:
An oversimpliﬁcation of a sophisticated thesis by an important ﬁgure.) So it is not
unusual  for  an  investor  to  have  both  bonds  and  stocks  in  his  portfolio.  In
this  event,  the  portfolio  can  be  managed  with  facility  by  using  both  Index
futures and Treasury bond futures.

Many  investors  consider  it  prudent  to  reallocate  their  capital  commit-
ments based on inﬂation rates, interest rates, and the reported expression on
Alan Greenspan’s face before Congressional testimony.

An efﬁcient and inexpensive way to reallocate assets between stocks and
bonds is to put on spreads of Treasury bond futures and Dow Index futures.
Analysis of recent long- and medium-term trends in the market, how-
ever, has led you to consider increasing your equity portfolio and decreasing
your bond portfolio. You have $200,000 invested in Dow stocks and $200,000
invested  in  Treasury  bonds.  You  would  like  to  take  advantage  of  the  sus-
tained market rally by increasing your equities exposure to 75% and decreas-
ing your bond holdings to 25%.

As for tactics, you can reallocate both sides of your portfolio — buying
$100,000 of stocks and selling $100,000 of bonds — with the sale of Treasury
bond futures and the purchase of Dow Index futures.

The Treasury bonds in your portfolio have a market price of 103-20. The
price of September Treasury bond futures is 102-20 per $100 of face value,
and $100,000 of face value must be delivered against each contract. The value
of the Dow Future is 10000, and the price of the Dow Index futures contract
is 10000 (ignoring the cost of carry, of course).

The  number  of  T-bond  futures  to  sell  is:  short  T-bond  futures:
$100,000/(102-20 ⋅ $1,000) = 1 (number of futures is rounded to the nearest
whole  number).  The  number  of  stock  index  futures  to  buy  is:  long  stock
index futures: $100,000/($10 ⋅ 10000) = 1 (number of futures is rounded to
the nearest whole number).

Results: at the September futures expiration, the value of the Dow Future
is 11000, a rate of return of 10%, and the market value of the bonds is 101-
08, a rate of return of –1%.

action results in an increase in portfolio value from $418,000 to $429,375. You
could have accomplished the same result by buying and selling bonds and
stocks, but not without tax consequences and the attendant transaction head-
aches. The use of futures to accomplish your goals allowed you to implement
your trading plan without disturbing your existing portfolio.

Perspective

While  there  can  be  no  argument  about  the  importance  of  CBOT®  DJIASM
Index futures — they are markets of enormous usefulness and importance —
there can also be no doubt that the futures novice should thoroughly prepare
himself before venturing into these pits. In such a highly leveraged environ-
ment,  mistakes  will  be  punished  much  more  severely  than  an  error  in  the
stock market. By the same token, ignorance of this vital tool is the mark of
an investor who is not serious about his portfolio, or who is less intense in
his investment goals. “They” (the infamous “they”) use all the weapons at
their disposal. So should “we.”

Options on Dow Index Futures

The buyer of this instrument has the choice, or the right, to assume a position.
It  is  his  option  to  do  so  —  unlike  a  futures  contract  in  which  he  has  an
obligation once entered. There are two kinds of options: calls (the right to buy
the underlying instrument) and puts (the right to sell). And options can be
bought (long) or sold (short) like futures contracts.

A  long  call  option  on  Dow  Index  futures  gives  the  buyer  the  right  to
buy one futures contract at a speciﬁed price which is called the “exercise,”
or “strike” price. A long put option on Dow Index futures gives the buyer
the right to sell one futures contract at the strike price. For example, a call
at a strike price of 10000 entitles the buyer to be long one futures contract
at  a  price  of  10000  when  he  exercises  the  option. A  put  at  the  same  strike
price entitles the buyer to be short one futures contract at 10000. The strike
prices  of  Dow  Index  futures  options  are  listed  in  increments  of  100  index
points, giving the trader the ﬂexibility to express his opinions about upward
or downward movement of the market.

The seller, or writer, of a call or put is short the option. Effectively selling
a call makes the writer short the market, just as selling a put makes the writer
long  the  market. As  in  a  futures  contract,  the  seller  is  obligated  to  fulﬁll  the
terms of the option if the buyer exercises. If you are short a call, and the long
exercises, you become short one futures contract at 10000. If you are short one
put and the long exercises, you become long one futures contract at 10000.

Buyers  of  options  enjoy  ﬁxed  risk.  They  can  lose  no  more  than  the
premium they pay to go long an option. On the other hand, sellers of options
have  potentially  unlimited  risk.  Catastrophic  moves  in  the  markets  often
bankrupt imprudent option sellers.

Option Premiums
The purchase price of the option is called the option premium. The option
premium  is  quoted  in  points,  each  point  being  worth  $100.  The  premium
for a Dow Index option is paid by the buyer at initiation of the transaction.
The  underlying  instrument  for  one  CBOT  futures  option  is  one  CBOT
DJIASM futures contract; so the option contract and the futures contract are

AU3772_book.fm  Page 348  Saturday, November 18, 2006  5:29 PM

348

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

essentially different expressions of the same instrument, and both are based
on the Dow–Jones Index.

Options  premiums  consist  of  two  elements:  intrinsic  value  and  time
value. The difference between the futures price and strike price is the intrinsic
value of the option. If the futures price is greater than the strike price of a
call, the call is said to be “in-the-money.” In fact, you can be long the futures
contract  at  less  than  its  current  price.  For  example,  if  the  futures  price  is
10020 and the strike price is 10000, the call is in-the-money and immediate
exercise  of  the  call  pays  $10  times  the  difference  between  the  futures  and
strike price, or $10 ⋅ 20 = $200. If the futures price is smaller than the strike
price, the call is “out-of-the-money.” If the two are equal, the call is “at-the-
money.” A put is in-the-money if the futures price is less than the strike price
and out-of-the-money if the futures price is greater than the strike price. It
is at-the-money when these two prices are equal.

Because a Dow Index futures option can be exercised at any date until
expiration, and exercise results in a cash payment equal to the intrinsic value,
the  value  of  the  option  must  be  at  least  as  great  as  its  intrinsic  value.  The
difference  between  the  option  price  and  the  intrinsic  value  represents  the
time value of the option. The time value reﬂects the possibility that exercise
will  become  more  proﬁtable  if  the  futures  price  moves  farther  away  from
the  strike  price.  Generally,  the  more  time  until  expiration,  the  greater  the
time  value  of  the  option,  because  the  likelihood  of  the  option  becoming
proﬁtable to exercise is greater. At expiration, the time value is zero and the
option price equals the intrinsic value.

Volatility

The degree of ﬂuctuation in the price of the underlying futures contract is
known as “volatility” (cf. Resources, Appendix D, for formula). The greater
the volatility of the futures, the higher the option premium. The price of a
futures option is a function of the futures price, the strike price, the time left to
expiration, the money market rate, and the volatility of the futures price. Of these
variables,  volatility  is  the  only  one  that  cannot  be  observed  directly.  Since
all the other variables are known, however, it is possible to infer from option
prices an estimate of how the market is gauging volatility. This estimate is
called the “implied volatility” of the option. It measures the market’s average
expectation  of  what  the  volatility  of  the  underlying  futures  return  will  be
until the expiration of the option. Implied volatility is usually expressed in
annualized terms. Implied volatility is suggested as an input to stop calcu-
lation in Chapter 27. The signiﬁcance and use of implied volatility is poten-
tially complex and confusing for the general investor, professionals having
a decided edge in this area. Their edge can be removed by serious study.

Exercising the Option

At expiration, the rules of optimal exercise are clear. The call owner should
exercise the option if the strike price is less than the underlying futures price.

AU3772_book.fm  Page 349  Saturday, November 18, 2006  5:29 PM

Chapter 17.2: Advancements in Investment Technology

349

The  value  of  the  exercised  call  is  the  difference  between  the  futures  price
and  the  strike  price.  Conversely,  the  put  owner  should  exercise  the  option
if the strike price is greater than the futures price. The value of the exercised
put is the difference between the strike price and the futures price.

To  illustrate,  if  the  price  of  the  expiring  futures  contract  is  7600,  a  call
struck  at  7500  should  be  exercised,  but  a  put  at  the  same  or  lower  strike
price should not. The value of the exercised call is $1000. The value of the
unexercised put is $0. If the price of the expiring futures contract is 7500, a
7600  put  should  be  exercised  but  not  a  call  at  7600  or  a  higher  strike.  The
value of the exercised put is $1000 and that of the unexercised call is $0.

The proﬁt on long options is the difference between the expiration value
and the option premium. The proﬁt on short options is the expiration value
plus the option premium. The expiration values and proﬁts on call and put
options can often be an important tool in an investment strategy. Their payoff
patterns and risk parameters make options quite different from futures. Their
versatility  makes  them  good  instruments  to  adjust  a  portfolio  to  changing
expectations  about  stock  market  conditions.  Moreover,  these  expectations
can  range  from  very  general  to  very  speciﬁc  predictions  about  the  future
direction and volatility of stock prices. Effectively, there is an option strategy
suited to virtually every set of market conditions.

Using Futures Options to Participate in Market Movements

Traders must often react to rapid and surprising events in the market. The
transaction costs and price impact of buying or selling a portfolio’s stocks
on short notice inhibit many investors from reacting to short-term market
developments. Shorting stocks is an even less palatable option for average
investors  because  of  the  margin  and  risks  involved  and  semantical  pre-
judices.

The ﬂexibility that options provide can allow one to take advantage of
the proﬁts from market cycles quickly and conveniently. A long call option
on Dow Index futures proﬁts at all levels above its strike price. A long put
option  similarly  proﬁts  at  all  levels  below  its  strike  price.  Let  us  examine
both strategies.

Proﬁts in Rising Markets

In August, the Dow Index is 10000 and the Dow Index September future is
10050. You expect the current Bull Market to continue, and you would like
to take advantage of the trend without tying up too much capital and also
undertake only limited risk.

You buy a September call option on Dow Index futures. These options
will  expire  simultaneously  with  September  futures,  and  the  futures  price
will be the same as the cash index at expiration.

Your analysis is bullish, so the 10500 call (out-of-the-money strike price)
is a reasonable alternative at a quoted premium of 10.10. You pay $1,010 for
the call ($100 ⋅ 10.10).

AU3772_book.fm  Page 350  Saturday, November 18, 2006  5:29 PM

350

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

The payoff: at the September expiration, the value of the Dow Future is
10610.  Now,  your  call  is  in-the-money,  and  you  exercise  it  and  garner  the
exercise value less the premium, or $90 = $10 ⋅ (10610 – 10500) – $100 ⋅ (10.10)
= $1,100 – $1,010. If the Dow Future stays at or below 10500, you let the call
expire worthless and simply lose the premium. This is the maximum possible
loss on the call. If the Dow Future increases by 101 points above the strike
price, you break even.

Instead of buying the call option, the trader could have invested $100,500
directly  in  the  Dow  stocks.  Given  a  value  of  the  Dow  Future  of  10110  in
September, he would have had a gain of $3,030. If he had invested directly in
the stocks, however, an unexpected market decline would have led to a loss.

Exploiting Market Reversals
The trader expects a reversal of the Bull Market now at 7800 and would like
some downside protection.

He  buys  a  put  with  a  strike  price  of  7700  (out-of-the-money).  The  put
premium is 9.80, for a total cost of $980 = $100 ⋅ 9.80. If the Index decreases
to 7600, with a corresponding decrease in the futures contract in September,
the  put  is  worth  $1,000.  The  maximum  loss  is  the  premium  cost,  which  is
lost if the Dow Future is above 7700 at expiration. The trader breaks even if
the Dow Future decreases by 98 points below the strike price.

Using Puts to Protect Proﬁts in an Appreciated Portfolio
During a sustained Bull Market, investors often search for ways of protecting
their  paper  proﬁts  from  a  possible  market  break.  Even  when  fundamental
economic factors tend to support a continued market upside, investors have
to  guard  against  unpredictable  “technical  market  corrections”  and  market
over-reactions to news.

Selling stocks to reduce downside risk is costly in fees and taxwise and
sacriﬁces potential price gains. What is desirable in a sideways market envi-
ronment  is  an  instrument  that  protects  the  value  of  a  portfolio  against  a
market  drop  but  does  not  constrain  upside  participation.  This  is  precisely
what put options are designed to do.

Situation 1

The market is in an uptrend in August. And the market lives in anxiety that
the Federal Reserve will tighten short-term interest rates further in the com-
ing months. The trader has $78,000 invested in the Dow portfolio, and the
Dow Future is at 7800.

In order to hedge his portfolio, he purchases a put option on September
futures  against  a  possible  market  downturn.  He  buys  a  7600  put  at  a  pre-
mium of 6.60, cost $100 ⋅ 6.60 = $660.

Buying the put places a ﬂoor on the value of the portfolio at the strike
price. Buying a put with a strike price of 7600 effectively locks in the value

AU3772_book.fm  Page 351  Saturday, November 18, 2006  5:29 PM

Chapter 17.2: Advancements in Investment Technology

351

of the portfolio at $76,000. Above its strike price, a put is not exercised and
the portfolio value is unconstrained. If the trader is wrong, and the market
goes up, he loses the premium paid for the put. Depending on which strike
price he chooses, he increases or decreases downside risk. He breaks even
when the Dow Future reaches a value of 7534 = 7600 – 66, the strike price
less the put premium. At this level, the unprotected and put-protected port-
folio are equally proﬁtable.

The similarity to life insurance is striking. If you don’t die, the premium

is wasted. But if you do….

Improving Portfolio Yields

Situation 2

All markets, as the reader is perhaps aware, are not trending. Days, weeks,
months (sometimes years) can pass while the markets grind up and down
in  what  are  euphemistically  known  as  trading  range  markets.  When  the
astute technician identiﬁes one of these market doldrums and judges that it
will  continue  so  he  can  reap  other  returns  on  his  portfolio  by  selling  puts
and calls on Dow Index futures.

For example, when the Dow Index is 10000 and the trader calculates that
it will not break out for the next month above 10200, he sells calls at a strike
price of 10200. The quoted premium of the 10200 call is, say, 10.10; selling a
10200 call generates $1010 income.

The  trader  pockets  the  entire  premium  as  a  proﬁt  if  the  index  remains
below  10200  at  the  September  expiration.  The  downside  of  this  trade  is  that
the trader gives up price appreciation above 10200. Above 10200, the combined
value  of  the  portfolio  and  short  call  premium  is  $101,010.  The  break-even
point is 10301, where the Dow Future is equal to the sum of the strike price
and call premium. Above this point the covered call portfolio becomes less
proﬁtable than the original portfolio. Since the short call is covered by the
portfolio, this strategy is not exposed to the risk represented by a naked call.
The main risk is that the trader gives up the proﬁt potential above the strike
price  of  the  call.  As  is  obvious  to  the  technician,  this  is  a  bad  strategy  in
trending  markets.  Only  in  clearly  range-bound  markets  would  an  enlight-
ened trader want to write covered calls. The call premium collected is some
compensation  for  this  risk,  but  cold  comfort  when  the  trader  has  misana-
lyzed the market. The best strike price of the call depends on the probabilities
you have assigned to future increases and behavior of the Dow.

Using Option Spreads in High- or Low-Volatility Markets

Long and short stock positions reﬂect deﬁnite market opinions or analyses.
The  market  will  go  up  or  the  market  will  go  down  and  the  moderately
competent  technician  should  be  right  about  this  more  often  than  the
unwashed  general  public.  In  markets  of  coiling  volatility  (i.e.,  lower  than

AU3772_book.fm  Page 352  Saturday, November 18, 2006  5:29 PM

352

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

average volatility and declining), it is sometimes possible to exploit uncer-
tainty by putting on a long straddle. The long straddle combines a long put
and a long call at the same strike price. This spread generates a return over
two  ranges  of  market  values:  values  below  the  strike  price  of  the  put  and
values  above  the  strike  price  of  the  call.  It  is  a  proﬁtable  strategy  given
sufﬁcient volatility. The Editor’s company used such a strategy immediately
before the crash of 1987 for managed accounts and collected disproportionate
proﬁts  on  a  very  low  risk  position.  Experienced  speculators  and  traders
generally  sell  high-volatility  markets  and  try  to  backspread  (go  long)  in
chosen  less  volatile  markets,  expecting  volatility  to  return  to  the  mean.
Sometimes they do this by writing a short straddle, a position with a short
put and a short call at the same strike price.

Situation 3

In August, a technical analysis predicts that volatility will increase, and the
market is in a coiling process. The direction of prices is uncertain but poten-
tially explosive. The trader buys a straddle of a long put at 7800 and a long
call at 7800. The quoted call premium is 18.90 and the quoted put premium
is  13.90.  The  total  cost  of  the  straddle  is  $3280  =  $100 ⋅  32.80.  This  is  the
maximum loss if the Dow Future stalls at 7800.

The  straddle  makes  a  proﬁt  when  the  Dow  Future  moves  enough  to
recover  the  cost  of  the  straddle,  either  below  7472  =  7800  –  328  or  above
8128 = 7800  +  328.  The  potential  upside  proﬁt  is  unlimited.  The  maximum
proﬁt  on  the  downside  is  $10  ⋅  (7800  –  328),  or  $74,720,  if  the  Dow  Future
goes to zero (somewhat unlikely, but one never knows what Chicken Little
the investor will do if he thinks the sky is falling).

Situation 4

In August, the investor calculates that options are overvalued and that vol-
atility will be lower than implied volatility. He expects a dormant market to
continue through the end of the summer. He decides to sell the September
put and call at 7800, collecting $3280. The return on this short straddle will
turn  negative  if  the  Dow  Future  in  September  goes  below  7472  or  above
8128. The maximum loss on the downside is $10 ⋅ (7800 – 328), or $74,720,
and the loss on the upside is unlimited. The investor, however, perceives the
risk as limited, because he believes that the Dow Future will neither increase
nor decrease to these levels within the next month when the options expire.
Of course, in these cases, the trader must also consider catastrophic risk —
as, for example, the Editor’s client who was short puts in the crash of 1987
and lost $57MM.

Perspective (EN9: Once again, do not practice the methods and 
techniques described in this chapter without complete conﬁdence 
in their use. A course in futures and options is recommended, or 
professional consultation.)

I  like  to  tell  these  stories  so  that  prospective  options  traders  and  general
investors are made dramatically aware of the potential dangers, as well as
the potential proﬁts. As I have said elsewhere in this book, the novice should
work  to  achieve  competence  and  experience  before  attempting  advanced
tricks in futures and options. On the other hand, the investment use of these
instruments  for  prudent  hedging  and  insurance  is  recommended  to  the
investor  willing  to  do  his  homework,  acquire  competence,  and  grow  in
investment skills.

Dow Index futures and futures options present new techniques of port-
folio protection and proﬁt-making for the general investor. Numerous strat-
egies  can  be  practiced  by  the  moderately  competent  investor  using  these
instruments. Keep in mind always that all the methods of analytical investing
espoused  in  this  book  are  the  base  discipline:  that  is,  knowledge  of  the
instruments and their use; prudent trade management; and stop loss disci-
pline; and close attention to the dynamics of the situation.

Above all, the existence of these instruments allows the most conserva-
tive of investors insurance and hedging techniques not previously available.
In  sum,  knowledge  of  the  DJIA  Futures  and  Options  on  Futures  is

absolutely essential for the competent technical investor and trader.

Trading Tactics

Midword

As a kind of foreword to the second part of this book, we might mention a
commentary,  “On  Understanding  Science:  An  Historical  Approach,”  by
James Bryant Conant, president emeritus of Harvard.

Dr. Conant points out that, in school, we learn that science is a systematic
collection of facts, which are then classiﬁed in orderly array, broken down,
analyzed, examined, synthesized, and pondered; and then lo! a Great Prin-
ciple  emerges,  pat,  perfect,  and  ready  for  use  in  industry,  medicine,  or
what-have-you.

He further points out that all of this is a mistaken point of view which
is  held  by  most  laymen.  Discovery  takes  form  little  by  little,  shrouded  in
questioning,  and  only  gradually  assumes  the  substance  of  a  clear,  precise,
well-supported theory. The neat tabulation of basic data, forming a series of
proofs and checks, does not come at the start, but much later. In fact, it may
be  the  work  of  other  men  entirely,  men  who,  being  furnished  with  the
conclusions,  are  then  able  to  construct  a  complete,  integrated  body  of  evi-
dence. Theories of market action are not conceived in a ﬂash of inspiration;
they are built, step by step, out of the experience of traders and students, to
explain the typical phenomena that appear over and over again through the
years.

In market operations, the practical trader is not concerned with theory
as such. The neophyte’s question, “What is the method?” probably means,
actually,  “What  can  I  buy  to  make  a  lot  of  money  easily  and  quickly?”  If
such a trader reads this book, he may feel that there is “something in it.” He
may feel “It’s worth a try” (a statement, incidentally, that reﬂects little credit
on his own previous tries). And he may start out quite optimistically, without
any understanding of theory, without any experience in these methods, and
without any basis for real conﬁdence in the method.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

In such cases, the chances are great that he will not immediately enjoy
the easy success he hopes for. His very inexperience in a new approach will
result  in  mistakes  and  failures.  But  even  with  the  most  careful  application
of  these  methods,  in  correctly  entered  commitments,  he  may  encounter  a
series of difﬁcult market moves which may give him a succession of losses.
Whereupon, having no solid conﬁdence in what he is doing, he may sigh,
put  the  book  back  on  the  shelf,  and  say,  “Just  as  I  thought.  It’s  no  damn
good.”

Now if you were about to go into farming for the ﬁrst time, you might
be told (and it would be true) that the shade tobacco business offers spec-
tacular proﬁts. But you would not expect to gain these proﬁts without invest-
ing capital, without studying how shade tobacco is grown, in what kinds of
soils, in what localities, nor without some experience with the crop.

Furthermore,  you  would  need  conﬁdence  —  faith  in  the  opportunity
and  also  in  the  methods  you  were  using.  If  your  ﬁrst  season’s  crop  were
blighted (and these things do happen), you would naturally be disappointed.
If it should happen that your second year’s crop were destroyed by a hail-
storm, you would be hurt and understandably despondent. And if your third
season’s crop were to be a total loss due to drought, you would probably be
very gloomy indeed (and who could blame you?). But you would not say,
“There’s nothing to it. It’s no damn good.”

You  would  know  (if  you  had  studied  the  industry  and  the  approved
cultivation methods) that you were right, regardless of any combination of
unfavorable circumstances, and you would know that the ultimate rewards
would justify your continuation no matter how hard the road, rather than
turn to some easier but less potentially proﬁtable crop.

So it is with technical methods in the stock market. Anyone may encoun-
ter  bad  seasons.  The  Major  Turns  inevitably  will  produce  a  succession  of
losses to Minor Trend operators using the methods suggested in this book.
And  there  will  be  times  when  a  man  who  has  no  understanding  of  basic
theory will be tempted to give up the method entirely and look for a “sys-
tem” that will ﬁt into the pattern of recent market action nicely, so that he
can say, “If I had only averaged my trades…. If I had followed the Dream
Book…. If I had taken Charlie’s tip on XYZ…. If I had done it this way or
that way, I would have come out with a neat proﬁt.”

It would be better, and safer, to understand at the start that no method
that  has  ever  been  devised  will  unfailingly  protect  you  against  a  loss,  or
sometimes even a painful succession of losses. You should realize that what
we are looking for is the probability inherent in any situation. And just as
you would be justiﬁed in expecting to draw a white bean from a bag which
you knew contained 700 white beans and 300 black beans (even though you
had  just  drawn  out  10  black  beans  in  succession!),  so  you  are  justiﬁed  in
continuing to follow the methods which, over long periods, seem most surely
and most frequently to coincide with the mechanism of the market.

So  this  book  should  not  be  given  a  quick  “once-over”  and  adopted
straightaway as a sure and easy road to riches. It should be read over and

over,  a  number  of  times,  and  it  should  be  consulted  as  a  reference  work.
Furthermore, and most important, you will need the experience of your own
successes and failures so that you will know that what you are doing is the
only logical thing you can do under a given set of circumstances. In such a
frame of mind, you will have your portion of successes; and your failures,
which you can take in stride as part of the business, will not ruin either your
pocketbook or your morale.

In  short,  the  problem  stated  and  analyzed  through  this  whole  volume
is not so much a matter of “systems” as it is a matter of philosophy. The end
result of your work in technical analysis is a deep understanding of what is
going  on  in  the  competitive  free  auction,  what  is  the  mechanism  of  this
auction,  and  what  is  the  meaning  of  it  all.  And  this  philosophy  does  not
grow  on  trees.  It  does  not  spring  full-bodied  from  the  sea  foam.  It  comes
gradually from experience and from sincere, intelligent, hard work.

The second section of this book, which follows, is concerned with tactics.
Up to this point, we have been studying the technical formations and their
consequences.  We  should  have  a  good  general  understanding  of  what  is
likely  to  happen  after  certain  manifestations  on  the  charts.  Knowing  that,
however, we will still need a more deﬁnite set of guides as to when and how
it is best to execute this or that sale.

This section is based on one man’s experience and his analysis of thou-
sands  of  speciﬁc  cases.  It  takes  up  questions  of  method,  of  detail,  and  of
application, and should provide you with a workable basis for your actual
market operations. As time goes on, you will very likely adopt reﬁnements
of your own, or modify some of the suggested methods according to your
own  experience.  But  the  authors  feel  that  the  suggestions  made  here  will
enable you to use technical analysis in an intelligent and orderly way that
should help to protect you from losses and increase your proﬁts.

The Tactical Problem

EN: Magee in this chapter addresses the question of tactics for the “speculator” who
follows  short-  and  medium-term  trends.  Chapter 18.1  addresses  the  question  of
strategy and tactics for the long-term investor. See Chapter 18.1 for a discussion of
the term “speculator.”

It is possible (as many traders have discovered) to lose money in a Bull
Market — and, likewise, to lose money trading short in a Bear Market. You
may be perfectly correct in judging the Major Trend; your long-term strategy,
let us say, may be 100% right. But without tactics, without the ability to shape
the details of the campaign on the ﬁeld, it is not possible to put your knowl-
edge to work to your best advantage.

There are several reasons why traders, especially inexperienced traders,
so often do so poorly. At the time of buying a stock, if it should go up, they
have  no  objectives  and  no  idea  of  what  policy  to  use  in  deciding  when  to
sell  and  take  a  proﬁt.  If  it  should  go  down,  they  have  no  way  of  deciding
when to sell and take a loss. Result: they often lose their proﬁts; and their
losses, instead of being nipped off quickly, run heavily against them. Also,
there is this psychological handicap: the moment a stock is bought (or sold
short), commissions and costs are charged against the transaction. The trader
knows  that  the  moment  he  closes  the  trade,  there  will  be  another  set  of
charges. Also, since he is not likely to catch the extreme top of a rally or the
extreme  bottom  of  a  reaction,  he  is  bound,  in  most  cases,  to  see  the  stock
running perhaps several points against him after he has made his commit-
ment.  Even  on  a  perfectly  sound,  wise  trade,  he  may  see  a  10%  or  more
paper loss, before the expected favorable move gets under way. Obviously,
if he weakens and runs for cover without sufﬁcient reason before the stock
has made the proﬁtable move he looked for, he is taking an unnecessary loss
and forfeiting entirely his chance to register a gain.

The long-term investor who buys in near the bottom and remains in the
market to a point near the top, and then liquidates and remains in cash or
bonds until (perhaps several years later) there is another opportunity to buy
in  at  the  bottom,  does  not  face  the  continual  problem  of  when  to  buy  and
when to sell. This assumes that one can tell precisely when such a bottom
has been reached, and that one can also tell when the trend has reached its
ultimate top (and those are very broad assumptions indeed). The long-term
investment  problem  for  large  gains  over  the  Major  Trends  is  by  no  means

It is possible to lose money owning stocks in a Bull Market. Notice
that this Major Top Formation did not occur in 1929, but in the summer of 1928. For
more than a year after this, a majority of stocks and the Averages continued the Bull
Market Advance. But Cudahy declined steadily, reaching a price below 50 well before
the 1929 Panic, and continued in its Bearish course for over 4 years, ultimately selling
at 20. Except for the somewhat unusual volume on the head on August 21, this is a
typical Head-and-Shoulders Pattern with a perfect Pullback Rally in mid-November.
It underscores what we have mentioned before; that a Head-and-Shoulders Top in
a stock, even when other stocks look strong, cannot safely be disregarded.

The Head-and-Shoulders Pattern, either in its simple form or with multiple heads
or shoulders, is likely to occur at Major and Intermediate Tops, and in reverse position
at  Major  and  Intermediate  Bottoms.  It  has  the  same  general  characteristics  as  to
volume, duration, and breakout as the Rectangles, and the Ascending and Descend-
ing Triangles. In conservative stocks, it tends to resemble the Rounding Turns.

in Chapters 5 and 5.1.

This section of the book is concerned more particularly with the specu-

lative purchase and sale of securities.

There are some basic differences between the “investment” point of view
and the “speculative.” It is a good thing to know these differences and make
sure  that  you  know  exactly  where  you  stand.  Either  viewpoint  is  tenable
and workable, but you can create serious problems for yourself, and sustain
heavy losses, if you confuse them.

One  difference  is  that,  as  a  speculator,  you  are  dealing  with  stocks  as
such. A stock, to be sure, represents ownership in a company. But the stock
is  not  the  same  thing  as  the  company.  The  securities  of  a  strong  company
are  often  weak;  and  sometimes  the  securities  of  a  very  weak  concern  are

FIGURE 201.
What would you have done with Hudson Motors? The great Panic
Move of October–November 1929 carried the Dow–Jones Industrial Average down
from  its  September  all-time  high  of  386.10  to  a  November  low  of  198.69.  A  rally,
bringing the Average back to 294.07 in April 1930, recovered 95 points or 51% of the
ground lost, a perfectly normal correction.

Suppose you had bought HT after the decline from its 1929 high of 93

, say at 56,
in the belief that the 37 point drop had brought it into a “bargain” range. On your
daily  chart,  you  would  have  seen  the  pattern  shown  above  (which  you  will  now
recognize as a Descending Triangle) taking shape in the early months of 1930. Would
you  have  had  a  protective  stop  at  51?  Would  you  have  sold  at  the  market  the  day
after HT broke and closed below 54? Or would you have hoped for a rally, perhaps
even bought more “bargains” at 50, at 48, at 40? Would you still have been holding
in June? Would you
onto your “good long-term investment” when HT reached 25
still have been holding HT when it reached its ultimate 1932 bottom at less than 3?

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

rara avis

EN: This 

 is largely extinct now.

A second difference is in the matter of dividends. The “pure investor,”
who,  by  the  way,  is  a  very  rare  person,  is  supposed  to  consider  only  the
“income”  or  potential  income  from  stocks  —  the  return  on  his  investment
 But there are many
in cash dividends. 
cases  of  stocks  which  have  maintained  a  steady  dividend  while  losing  as
much  as  75%  or  more  of  their  capital  value.  There  are  other  cases  where
stocks have made huge capital gains while paying only nominal dividends
or  none  at  all.  If  the  dividend  rate  were  as  important  as  some  investors
consider it, the only research tool one would need would be a calculator to
determine  the  percentage  yields  of  the  various  issues,  and  hence  their
“value.” And, on this basis, stocks paying no dividends would have no value
at all.

From the technical standpoint, “income,” as separate from capital gains
and losses, ceases to have any meaning. The amount realized in the sale of
a  stock,  less  the  price  paid  and  plus  total  dividends  received,  is  the  total
gain.  Whether  the  gain  is  made  entirely  in  capital  increase,  or  entirely  in
dividends, or in some combination of these, makes no difference. In the case
of short sales, the short seller must pay the dividends. But, here again, this
is simply one factor to be lumped with the capital gain or loss in determining
the net result of the transaction.

There is a third source of confusion. Very often, the “pure investor” will
insist that he has no loss in the stock he paid $30 for, which is now selling
at  $22,  because  he  has  not  sold  it.  Usually  he  will  tell  you  that  he  has
conﬁdence in the company and that he will hold the stock until it recovers.
Sometimes he will state emphatically that he never takes losses.

How such an investor would justify his position if he had bought Stude-
baker at over $40 in 1953 and still held Studebaker Packard at around $5 in
(EN: Or Osborne at $25 and $0 in the 1980s or Visacalc at similar prices in
1956 
the same decade. EN9: Or Enron and WorldCom in the 2000s.)
 is hard to say. But
for him, the loss does not exist until it becomes a “realized” loss.

Actually, his faith that the stock will eventually be worth what he paid

for it may be no more than a speculative hope; and a forlorn one at that.

Furthermore, one may question whether his reasoning is always consis-
tent.  For  example,  suppose  another  stock  this  investor  had  bought  at  $30
was now selling at $45. Would he tell you that he did not consider a proﬁt
or  loss  until  the  stock  was  sold?  Or  would  he  be  tempted  to  speak  of  the
“proﬁt” he had in this purchase?

It is all right to consider gains or losses either on the basis of “realized”
or completed transactions, or on the basis of the market values “accrued” at
a particular time. But it is not being honest with yourself to use one method
to conceal your mistakes and the other method to accentuate your successes.
The confusion of these concepts is responsible for many ﬁnancial tragedies.
EN: One might almost say, in the modern context, that such confusion amounts to
willful or neurotic behavior. Given the easy availability of portfolio software which
“marks to market” positions, avoidance of this knowledge can only be regarded as
self-defeating.

Chapter eighteen: The Tactical Problem

363

As  a  trader  using  technical  methods,  you  will  probably  ﬁnd  the  most
realistic  view  is  to  consider  your  gains  and  losses  “as  accrued.”  In  other
words, your gain or loss at a given time will be measured with reference to
the closing pricing of the stock on that day.

Recapitulating,  it  is  important:  (1)  to  avoid  regarding  a  stock  and  the
company it represents as identical or equivalent; (2) to avoid the conscious
or  unconscious  attribution  of  “value”  to  a  stock  on  the  basis  of  dividend
yield, without regard to market prices; and (3) to avoid confusing “realized”
and “accrued” gains or losses.*

The technical trader is not committed to a “buy and hold” policy. There
are  times  when  it  is  clearly  advantageous  to  retain  a  position  for  many
months or for years. But there are also times when it will pay to get out of
a  stock,  either  with  a  proﬁt  or  with  a  loss.  The  successful  technician  will
never, for emotional causes, remain in a situation which, on the evidence at
hand, is no longer tenable.

An  experienced  trader  using  technical  methods  can  take  advantage  of
the shorter Intermediate Trends, and it can be shown that the possible net
gains  are  larger  than  the  entire  net  gains  on  the  Major  Trend,  even  after
allowing for the greater costs in commissions and allowing for the greater
income tax liability on short-term operations.

But  it  should  be  understood  that  any  such  additional  proﬁts  are  not
easily won. They can be obtained only by continual alertness and adherence
to  systematic  tactical  methods.  For  the  market,  regarded  as  a  gambling
machine,  compares  very  poorly  with  stud  poker  or  roulette,  and  it  is  not
possible to “beat the market” by the application of any simple mathematical
system. If you doubt this, it would be best to stop at this point and make a
careful  study  of  any  such  “system”  that  may  appeal  to  you,  checking  it
against a long record of actual market moves. Or ask yourself whether you
have ever known anyone who followed such a system alone, as a guide to

successful  traders,  aided  by  computer  technology  and  advances  in  ﬁnance  theory,
have created objective systems which have been successful in the ﬁnancial markets.
However,  the  markets  usually  become  aware  of  the  success  of  these  systems  and
develop counterstrategies to defeat them. So there is a tendency for the performance
of mechanical systems to degenerate or totally fail over time. In ﬁne it is the happy

The practice of technical analysis, on the other hand, is not a mathemat-

to search out the signiﬁcance of market moves in the light of past experience

fears, developments in the industry, and all other factors that are known to
anyone. It is not necessary that we know, in each case, what particular hopes,
fears, or developments are represented by a certain pattern. It is important
that we recognize the pattern and understand what results may be expected
to emerge from it.

The shorter-term proﬁts are, you might say, payment for service in the
“smoothing out” of inequalities of trends, and for providing liquidity in the
market. As compared to the long-term investor, you will be quicker to make
commitments, and quicker to take either proﬁts or (if necessary) losses. You
will  not  concern  yourself  with  maintaining  “position”  in  a  market  on  any
particular stocks (although, as you will see, we will try to maintain a certain
“total  Composite  Leverage”  [or  risk  and  proﬁt  exposure]  according  to  the
state  of  the  market,  which  accomplishes  the  same  result).  You  will  have
smaller gains on each transaction than the longer-term investor, but you will
have  the  advantage  of  being  able  to  frequently  step  aside  and  review  the
entire situation before making a new commitment.

Most  particularly,  you  will  be  protected  against  Panic  Markets.  There

ment banking clients by suggesting that their retail clients should sell their holdings.
Finally,  before  we  get  on  with  the  subject  of  tactics,  the  operations  we
are speaking of are those of the small- and medium-sized trader. The meth-
ods suggested here, either for getting into a market or getting out of it, will
apply to the purchase or sale of odd lots, 100 shares, 200 shares, and some-
times up to lots of thousands of shares or more of a stock, depending on the
activity  and  the  market  for  the  particular  issue.  The  same  methods  would
not  work  for  the  trader  who  was  dealing  in  10,000-share  blocks  (except  in
the  largest  issues),  since  in  such  cases,  his  own  purchases  or  sales  would
seriously  affect  the  price  of  the  stock.  Such  large-scale  operations  are  in  a

If  an  investor  only  learned  one  thing  from  this  book,  and  it  were
this one thing, that one thing might be the salvation of his portfolio, or his retirement
plan  (if  all  his  assets  in  the  investment  plan  were  shares  of  Enron).  Instead,  the
employees  of  Enron  made  a  major  mistake  in  not  having  a  diversiﬁed  retirement
portfolio – they had all their eggs in one basket, their income and savings came from
one source. But diversiﬁcation is not even the crucial lesson here. The lesson is get
out of the stock when it reverses. The corollary of that lesson is, never buy a stock
in a downtrend. And there is even a more important lesson: Never buy a stock when
it  is  in  a  swan  dive.  So  obvious  you  say.  Not  so  obvious  at  the  time  for  portfolio

Strategy and Tactics 
for the Long-Term Investor

What’s a Speculator, What’s an Investor?

In the years since Magee wrote Chapter 18, some different connotations have
attached themselves to the terms “speculator” and “investor.” A great cul-
tural  shift  has  also  occurred.  The  days  when  the  New  Haven  (New  York,
New Haven and Hartford Railroad) was a beacon of respectability (and lent
luster to its investor) and paid good dividends are gone forever. And so is
the  New  Haven.  In  fact,  after  the  turn  of  the  century,  corporations  saw  a
change  in  investor  sentiment  about  dividends.  Investors  wanted  capital
appreciation and cared less for dividends. In fact it has lately been considered
the mark of a “growth stock” not to pay dividends. Evidently, the days of
the New Haven are gone forever, when an “investor” was one who bought,
held, and collected dividends, and “speculators” were slightly suspect men
like  Magee  who  played  the  medium-term  trends  and  bought  “unchic,”
“speculative” stocks. It all has a sepia tone to it.

commercials

,  as  opposed  to 

Yesterday’s speculator might be called a medium-term investor today.
While  the  term  “speculator”  could  still  be  applied  to  anyone  who
“trades” the market, today that old-time speculator and his kind would more
likely be called traders than speculators. Commodity traders who have no
business  interest  in  the  contracts  they  exchange  are  always  referred  to  as
speculators
,  who  are  hedgers  and  users  of  the
commodities they trade. Now “day traders” might be considered the equiv-
alent  of  the  old-time  speculators.  And  only  the  passive,  in  the  opinion  of
this editor, never trade at all and sit on their holdings during Bear Markets.
On the spectrum of investors, from investor to gambler, the old “New
Haven Investor” who “wants his dividends” is pretty rare these days, and,
again, may be one of those trust departments which doesn’t want to get sued
and so stays out of stocks which go up. After all, prudent men don’t “trade
in  volatile  stocks”  but  “invest  in  safe  issues,  like  bonds,”  which  only  lose
about 1.5–2.0% of their purchasing value per year, but preserve the illusion
of having “preserved principal.”

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

One Deﬁnition of the Long-Term Investor

Let  us  take  as  a  long-term  investor  now  one  who  expects  to  at  least  track
market returns, for it has been demonstrated over a relatively long period
of time that this can be done by passive indexing. At the turn of the century,
as  this  is  written,  it  would  seem  neither  long-term  nor  medium-term  nor
short-term investors think about the risks involved in matching the market
since,  entering  the  third  millennium,  it  has  been  so  many  years  since  we
have had a really vicious Bear Market. Dow 36000? This is a passing phase.
As each Bull Market reaches higher and higher, the odds are lower and lower
that it will continue — historic Bull Markets of the 1990s notwithstanding.
What  then  are  the  strategy  and  tactics  for  the  long-term  investor  to
(EN9:  Is  it  necessary  to  remind  the

achieve  a  goal  of  matching  the  market? 
reader of Chapter 5.1 and the Dow Theory?)

Let  us  remark  immediately  that  the  tactics  Magee  described  for  the
speculator  —  or  trader  if  you  will  —  are  not  at  all  in  conﬂict  with  the
short-term tactics used occasionally by the long-term investor. As buying or
selling  time  approaches  the  stops  of  the  long-term  investor,  that  investor
becomes a trader. Then he can and should adopt the trader’s tactics. Sooner
or later the focus even narrows to real time at the moment of trade execution.
Interestingly,  the  charting  techniques  we  have  described  here  work  on
tick-by-tick  data  in  real  time  also.  So  if  the  trader  wants  to  enter  into  the
real-time  environment,  he  can  attempt  to  time  his  trade  right  down  to  the
real-time  chart  formations.  Of  course,  only  the  really  active  and  skilled
long-term  investor  will  be  concerned  with  squeezing  the  last  half  point  or
points out of his position. But this illustration of the time focus is addressed
to any investor or trader or speculator to demonstrate the fractal nature of
both price data and the applicability of Magee-type technical analysis to it.

The Strategy of the Long-Term Investor

The  strategy  of  the  long-term  investor  is  to  catch  the  long  trends  —  to
participate in trades which last months and years. But this strategy does not
intend to be sucked into long Bear Markets. Rather, portfolios are liquidated
or hedged when Bear Market signals are received. As has been previously
seen  in  examples  of  the  performance  of  (more  or  less)  mechanical  Dow
Theory  (Chapter 5),  this  kind  of  performance  can  be  quite  satisfactory  —
better  indeed  than  buy-and-hold  strategies  which  have  come  much  into
vogue because of the Clinton–Gore Bull Markets of the 1990s.

If  the  goal  is  to  beat  not  only  the  markets  but  the  mutual  funds  (only
20%  of  which  outperform  the  market  over  the  long  term  anyway),  then
passive indexing is the most likely strategy. This may be done in a number
of ways — index funds, buying the basket, buying the futures, etc. But the
most attractive method might be the use of the SPDRs and DIAMONDS and
the like. The tactics may be calibrated to the risk tolerance and character of
the  investor.  He  might  hedge  or  sell  on  Dow  Theory  signals,  or  on  breaks

of the 200-day moving average, or on breaks of the long-term or intermediate
trends lines with a ﬁlter (Magee recommended 2%, and this might be cali-
brated to the character of the markets, and increased to 3% or a factor relevant
to  actual  market  volatility).  Instruments  we  have  previously  discussed  —
SPDRs, DIAMONDS, index futures, and options — can be used to execute
these tactics.

Sufﬁce it to say that every strategy must provide for the plan gone wrong,
in  other  words  the  dreaded  Bear  Market.  Bear  Markets  would  not  be  so
fearsome if the average investor did not insist on seeing only the long side
of the market. Long-term strategies go out the window quickly when blood
runs  on  the  ﬂoor  of  the  NYSE.  The  well-prepared  technical  investor  has  a
plan which provides for the liquidation of positions gone bad and presum-
ably the discipline to execute it.

This  involves  the  regular  recomputation  of  stops  as  markets  go  in  the
planned direction, and ruthless liquidation of losers which do not perform.
One may think of a portfolio as a fruit tree. Weak branches must be pruned
to improve the yield. Stop computation is treated in a number of places in
this book (cf. Chapter 27). For the investor trading long term, this may be,
as an example only and not as a recommendation, the breaking of the 200-day
moving average and/or the breaking of a long-term trendline. The 200-day
moving average is widely believed to be the long-term trend indicator, and
EN9: Let me emphasize here that
believing will sometimes make it come true. 
is a parameter and an example. Personal research may ﬁt a better parameter
“200” 
to the actual market.

In reality, more than the 200-day or a manually drawn trendline should be
looked  at.  The  chart  patterns  comprising  the  portfolio  should  be  considered
also, as well as charts of major indexes and averages. Also consider the condi-
tion of the averages and their components — their technical state — whether
they are topping, consolidating, trending as indicated by their charts.

Rhythmic Investing

In addition, if Chapter 31 on “Not All in One Basket” is weighed seriously,
one  might  be  rolling  a  portfolio  from  long  to  short  gradually  in  natural
rhythm with the markets and in harmony with the Magee Evaluative Index
described there. That is the preferred strategy of the authors and editor of
this book.

These things all depend on the goals, temperament, and character of the
investor. If he is going to spend full time on the markets, he is probably not
a  long-term  investor.  Such  men  eat  well  and  sleep  soundly  at  night.  The
trader  is  lean  and  hungry  —  not  necessarily  for  money,  but  for  activity.  It
behooves one to know his type as a trader or investor. And knowing one’s
type or character is best established before ﬁnding it out in the markets, as
the markets can be an expensive place to search for self-knowledge.

There  is  no  inherent  conﬂict  in  holding  long-term  positions  and  also
attempting to proﬁt from intermediate trends, depending on the amount of

capital in hand. It depends on how much time and energy and capital the
investor  wants  to  put  into  trading.  A  long-term  strategy  can  be  imple-
mented  with  a  modicum  of  time  and  energy,  as  follows.  Pay  attention  to
the  major  indexes  and  averages  and  buy  on  breakouts,  at  the  bottoms  of
consolidations  and  on  pullbacks.  Sell  or  hedge  on  the  breaking  of
trendlines, calculated on basing points (see Chapter 28) and the penetration
of support zones.

The  long-term  investor  will  accept  greater  swings  against  his  position
than  the  intermediate-term  trader  or  speculator.  As  an  example  with  the
method  of  using  basing  points  in  Chapter 28,  the  speculator  is  using  a
“3-day-away rule,” whereas a long-term investor might be using a 4-week
basing point or some such analogy. And, if interested, when he suspects or
analyzes  that  a  long  Bull  Market  is  approaching  a  climax,  he  might  adopt
the 3-day rule also, or even begin following his stock with a daily stop just
under  the  market.  Beware  though.  Professionals  look  for  stops  just  under
the close of the previous day in situations such as these.

It would be wise not to confuse long term investing with “buy and hold”
or  as  it  was  expressed  in  one  investment  fad  in  the  1970s,  “one  decision
investing.” As an example of this misguided thinking, in 1972, the “best and
brightest” investment analysts (fundamental) on the Street picked a portfolio
of  stocks  for  the  generation,  or  twenty  years.  The  companies  would  be
difﬁcult to argue with as the crème de la crème of American business. After
all  who  could  qvetch  at  Avon,  Eastman  Kodak,  IBM,  Polaroid  (unless  he
happened to look at Figure 253), Sears Roebuck, and Xerox? Even today if
you didn’t have a close eye on the market, you would immediately respond,
“blue  chips.”  Here  is  a  table  showing  the  stocks  and  the  results  achieved
over the long term.

Figure 201.1.1
Like IBM in the previous ﬁgure, Xerox was recommended at a place
where it should have been sold instead of bought. The comments there might apply
to the chart here. The foolishness of “buy and hold” or “one decision investing” is
amply  illustrated  by  observing  the  long  term  swings  of  the  stock  and  thus  of  the
investor's equity. Technical analysis is intended to be an antidote to such foolishness.

Summary

The  long-term  investor  attempts  to  catch  major  market  moves  —  those
lasting hundreds, if not thousands of Dow points and stay in trades for many
months if not years.

Within this time frame he expects to take secondary trends against his
position.  Depending  on  his  temperament  and  inclination,  he  may  attempt
to  hedge  his  portfolio  upon  recognizing  secondary  market  moves  against
his primary direction.

His  preference  for  stocks  and  portfolio  will  be  for  market  leaders,  for
baskets that reproduce the major indexes (or Index Shares) as the ballast for
his portfolio, and he may choose some speculative stocks to add spice to his
portfolio.

In spite of his penchant for long-lasting trades he will not tolerate weak,
losing,  or  underperforming  stocks.  They  are  the  shortest  of  his  trades.  He
will cut losses and let proﬁts run, the truest of the market maxims and the
least  understood  by  unsuccessful  investors.  The  other  maxim  least  under-
stood by investors is “buy strength, sell weakness.”

Truly  sophisticated  investors  attempt  to  participate  in  Bear  Market
trends also. This is the greatest difference between professional and general
investors — professionals have no bias against the short side.

The All-Important Details

In this chapter and the one following, we take up a number of elementary
suggestions  which  are  intended  largely  for  the  beneﬁt  of  those  who  have
never kept charts before. Much of this will seem obvious and repetitive to
the advanced student, although even he may ﬁnd some thoughts that will
simplify  his  work.  The  beginner  should  read  these  chapters  carefully  and
use them for later reference.

The  details  of  how  and  when  you  keep  the  charts  will  not  guarantee
you proﬁts. But if you fail to work out these details in such a way as to make
your work easy, as part of a regular systematic routine, you cannot expect
to keep up your charts properly, or to make any proﬁts either.

Charting, and analyzing your charts, is not a difﬁcult process, nor will
it take too much of your time if you have determined on a reasonable number
of charts, and if you have arranged for doing the work regularly, meaning
every day without fail.

You will need a source of data — the day’s market prices and volume.
If you live in a big city, your evening paper will carry the complete list, and
you can plan to set aside a certain period before dinner, or after dinner, or
during  the  evening.  If  you  cannot  allot  such  a  period  and  keep  it  sacred
against all other social or business obligations, then plan to do the charting
in the morning. But set a deﬁnite time and let nothing interfere, ever, or you

downloading  procedures  and  access  to  data  sources  and  Internet  sites. 
But  the
principle is the same.

You should have a suitable place to work and keep your charts. If it is
at  home,  in  the  dining  room  or  living  room,  other  members  of  the  family
should understand that what you are doing is important. You should be able
to shut the door and work without interruption. The light should be bright
and as free from shadows as possible. (It makes a big difference, especially
if you are keeping a large number of charts.) The ordinary desk lamp throws
a reﬂected glare directly across the paper and into the eyes. It can be a strain
if you are doing much of this close work. Better to have an overhead light,
placed  just  a  few  inches  in  front  of  your  head  and  a  convenient  distance
above; and if this light can be a ﬂuorescent ﬁxture using two 40-watt lamps,
you will get almost perfect shadowless lighting. These suggestions apply, of
course, in case you are not working by daylight.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Have plenty of room. A big desk top, a dining room table, with a large
clear space for chart books, extra sheets, pencils, scratch paper, ruler, calcu-
lator,  computer  equipment,  and  anything  else  you  need.  If  your  working
surface is fairly low, say 28 or 29 inches from the ﬂoor, it will be less tiring
than the usual 30-inch desk height.

Whether you are working in ink or in pencil, pick out the writing tool
that is easiest for you to use. If you are using pencils, try several different
makes and degrees of hardness. Find one that is hard enough not to smudge
too easily, and yet is not so hard that you have to bear down to make a clean
black  mark.  The  wrong  kind  of  pencil  can  tire  you  and  irritate  you  more
than you realize. Also, have plenty of pencils, a dozen at least, well-sharp-
ened, so that as soon as one becomes a triﬂe dull and you are not getting a
clean, ﬁne line, you can simply lay it aside and continue at once with another
fresh-sharpened pencil.

Keep  your  charts  in  loose-leaf  books,  with  big  enough  rings  to  make
turning  the  pages  easy.  Don’t  overcrowd  the  books.  Get  new  books  if  a
volume is too crowded. Finished charts may be kept in ﬁle folders. The only
ones that need to be in the books are the current sheets and the sheets for
the immediately preceding period. If possible, use a seven-ring binder. Pages
are easily torn loose from two- and three-ring binders, but seven rings will
hold the pages safely and you will seldom have one tear out.

The  charts  you  keep  will  become  increasingly  valuable  to  you  as  the
chart history builds up. The old chart sheets will be very helpful to you for
reference.  Provide  a  ﬁle  or  space  where  they  can  be  indexed  and  kept  in
chronological order, and also ﬁle folders for brokers’ slips, dividend notices,
corporate reports, clippings and articles, notes on your own methods, and
analyses and special studies of the work you are doing.

In this connection you will, of course, keep a simple but complete record
of  each  purchase,  sale,  dividend,  etc.,  on  stocks  you  have  bought  or  sold.
This record will make your work much easier when the time comes to ﬁgure
out income taxes. It will also give you all the statistical information you need
to judge the results of your trading operations.

EN: At the beginning of my investment career, and often in the middle of it, I
thought the above was cracker-barrel wisdom. The longer I last the more I think that
homespun  wisdom  might  be  the  best  kind  to  have  in  investing  —  somewhat  like
Mark Twain, who was astounded at how much his father increased in wisdom the
older Twain himself got.

We may restate the modest homilies above: Be serious. Be methodical. Be dis-
ciplined. Be business-like. Anyone who succeeds in investing without these qualities
is the recipient of blind luck and will be fortunate not to fall into a hole before his
career is over.

These thoughts occur when one is wondering how Magee would have viewed the
advent of the microcomputer and its impact on technical analysis and investing. Might
he have said, “What hath this tool wrought?! — Wonders and abominations!!”

Given the possibilities for complicating analysis and operations when confronted
with all the bells and whistles of the average computer software package, the investor

must maintain perspective. What, then, are the all-important details in practicing
technical analysis with the aid of a computer?

The Simplest and Most Direct Way to Use a Computer 
for Charting Analysis 

In  reality,  the  computer  can  be  used  as  a  simple  tool  to  do  a  simple  job.  There  is
nothing inherently complicated about keeping a chart on a computer. All computer
software packages enable bar charting. And many, if not most, enable many other
kinds of charting, from candlesticks to oscillator charting. The process, in almost all
commercially  available  packages,  is  so  simple  that  explaining  it  here  would  be
superﬂuous  (cf.  Resources,  Appendix  D,  for  demonstrations),  except  to  say,  in
general,  it  consists  of  retrieving  data,  updating  the  program’s  price  database,  and
clicking  an  icon  to  run  a  chart.  The  software  packages  themselves  explain  their
features better than can be done here. What is important here is to give perspective.
In  this  respect,  charting  can  be  done  with  quite  expensive  programs  and  also
on  publicly  available  free  programs,  or  freeware.  Charting  can  also  be  done  with
interactive  charting  programs  on  many  Internet  sites.  The  basic  bar  chart  can  be
enhanced with an unending number of technical studies — moving averages, oscil-
lators,  etc.,  etc.  Therein  lies  the  danger.  Chart  analysis  in  itself  is  a  qualitative
process. Decorating graphic charts with number-driven information and studies can
lead the general investor astray — and into confusion and indecision.

So the ﬁrst preference of this analyst is to keep the process as simple as possible.
Get the data. Draw a chart. Analyze the patterns. Consider the volume. Draw the
appropriate analytical lines. This can usually be done by the program on the screen.
Often  a  better  graphic  picture  may  be  obtained  by  printing  the  chart  and  hand-
drawing the analytical lines. And this brings to the fore one of the main problems
of almost all the software packages — that screen graphics are poor and, at least to
old  chartists,  disorienting.  They  are  especially  disorienting  to  analysts  who  are
accustomed to working on Tekniplat chart paper. With passing editions of Resources,
this  problem  will  be  dealt  with.
  (EN9:  In  the  intervening  years  since  the  8th
Edition two things have occurred: the Editor adjusted to modern technology
and  the  technology  achieved  a  level  of  excellence  acceptable  to  a  carping
analyst.  Internet  technical  analysis  sites  such  as  stockcharts.com  and
prophet.net improved to be surprisingly valuable resources at unbelievably
low prices – even free.)

The question of graphic representation of the facts is worth noting as a persistent
one.  To  a  certain  extent,  the  individual  analyst  will  solve  this  conundrum  by
adapting  his  eye  and  mind  to  a  graphic  environment,  using  one  graphic  method
consistently and seeing how it relates to the facts in the market. John Magee-oriented
solutions to this problem will be available on the web site, www.edwards-magee.com.
In Resources, the reader may see some examples of very simple and inexpensive
software packages and Internet sites which are quite adequate to the required tasks
of charting technical analysis, as well as more complex number-driven analysis.

Summary 

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

The  computer  is  an  invaluable  tool  for  analysis.  Use  of  it  will  enable  the
following:

•

•

•

•

Data may be acquired automatically via Internet or dial-up sites at little or
no  cost.  Some  of  these  even  offer  real-time  data,  which  is  a  way  for  the
unsophisticated  trader  to  go  broke  in  real  time;  but  which  the  general
investor  may  desire  on  the  day  of  executing  a  trade.  Many  of  these  sites
offer every kind of analysis from respectable technical analysis (usually too
complicated) to extraterrestrial channeling.
A  computer  package  and  Internet  portfolio  sites  will  give  the  analyst  vir-
tually  effortless  portfolio  accounting  and  mark  to  the  market  prices  —  a
valuable device to have to keep the investor from mixing his cash and accrual
accounting, as Magee says.
The computer will enable processing of a hitherto unimaginable degree. An
unlimited number of stocks may be analyzed. Choosing those to trade with
a computer will be dealt with in Chapters 20 and 21.
Resources (Appendix D) contains information on software packages which
the reader may try and purchase at quite reasonable prices. In all likelihood,
the  least  expensive  of  these  will  be  adequate  to  the  needs  of  most  general
investors.
In  addition,  I  present  a  brief  discussion  of  Internet  sites  and
resources.

The Kind of Stocks We Want —
The Speculator’s Viewpoint

The  speciﬁcations  of  the  kind  of  stock  we  want  to  chart  are  fairly  simple,
and  they  are  few.  We  want  a  stock  which  will  enable  us  to  make  a  proﬁt
through trading operations. That means a stock whose price will move over
a wide enough range to make trading worthwhile. There are those who are
concerned mainly with safety of principal and the assurance of income from
(EN9:  Or  were.)
a  stock.  For  them,  there  are 
  stocks  which  afford  a  very
considerable degree of stability. You may (and probably will) want to keep
a substantial part of your total capital in stocks of this type. They move in
a  narrow  price  range.  They  are  extremely  resistant  to  downside  breaks  in
the  market.  They  are  also  (and  necessarily)  unresponsive  to  fast  upside
moves  in  the  market  as  a  whole.  These  stocks  are  highly  desirable  for  the
conservative  investor.  However,  they  are  not  the  most  suitable  issues  for
trading  operations,  since  their  swings  are  small,  and  commissions  would
tend to diminish the narrow trading proﬁts that could be taken. Also, they
do not make the sharp, clear chart patterns of the more speculative issues,

can disappear from the market as a factor there is no place to hide, except in bonds,
which,  when  stagnant,  only  lose  real  value  at  the  rate  of  inﬂation  and  loss  of
purchasing  power  of  the  dollar.  And  even  bonds  should  be  subject  to  frequent
reevaluation using the tools described in this book.)

To amplify this comment and explain a bit about what underlies what
we  are  doing,  let  us  assume  a  certain  company  has  two  issues  of  stock,  a
preferred and a common. Since (we will assume) the concern has a certain
steady minimum proﬁt which it has earned for years, sufﬁcient to pay the
preferred  dividend,  the  continuance  of  these  dividends  seems  practically
assured. But the dividends on the preferred are ﬁxed at, let us say, 6%. Now
the common stock gets all that is left. In one year, there may be 50 cents a
share for the common stockholders. The next year, there may be $2.00 a share
or four times as much. In a case like this, if there are no other factors, you
would expect the preferred stock to sell at a fairly steady price without much
change,  whereas  the  common  stock  is  subject  to  a  “leverage”  and  might
shoot up to four times its former value. The more speculative issues represent

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

either a business which is, by its nature, uncertain as to net proﬁt from year
to year, where the volume of business or the proﬁt margin ﬂuctuates widely,
or  one  in  which  the  majority  of  the  “sure”  net  proﬁt  has  been  sheared  off
for the beneﬁt of senior obligations. There are also other factors that affect
the  speculative  swing  of  a  stock,  and,  as  a  result,  one  issue  may  be  very
sensitive  and  another  extremely  conservative;  and  between  them  there
would be all shades and degrees of sensitivity or risk. It is enough here to
note brieﬂy that the nature of the business itself does not always account for
the  habits  of  the  stock,  since  the  other  factors  may  be  very  important.  But
most stocks have a fairly well-deﬁned “swing” power, and you can usually
determine by past performance how a stock will behave in the future as to
(EN9: Or we might say, short-term volatility and long-term
the extent of its swing. 
range.)

Incidentally, for short-term trading 

(EN9: Amusing in the modern context.
By short-term trading Magee means trading of trends of shorter length than Dow
Waves)
, we are thinking about the habits of the stock which are only partly
determined by the business it represents. Purchase of stock in one company
which has a somewhat uncertain or ﬂuctuating proﬁt record may be more
conservative than purchase of a highly leveraged stock of another company
whose basic business is steadier and more conservative. We will take up the
matter of determining these risk constants a little later.

One should also understand that the short sale of a stock does not imply
any  feeling  that  the  country  is  going  to  the  dogs  or  even  that  the  concern
represented  is  going  to  the  dogs.  Such  a  sale  merely  indicates  your  belief
that  the  stock  may  be  temporarily  overpriced;  that  earnings  or  dividends
may  have  been  abnormal  in  recent  years  and  are  likely  to  be  reduced;  or
that for one reason or another, the stock of the company may be worth a bit
less than it has been worth.

For technical trading, we want a fairly speculative stock, one which will
make  sizable  swings  up  in  a  Bullish  Trend,  and  down  in  a  Bearish  Trend.
The very factors which tend to make a stock safe and desirable to the investor
may make it entirely unsuitable for trading. And with certain reservations,
which we will take up, the more speculative the stock the better it is for our
purposes.

EN: Entering the third millennium (since we Anglo-Saxons started counting —
the fourth or ﬁfth by other measures) the distinctions between “speculative” stocks
and every other kind of stock has grown increasingly blurry. Rather than apply a
perhaps pejorative (in the minds of some readers) term like “speculative” to otherwise
innocent stocks, we would do better to describe stocks as wide ranging or narrow
ranging, as volatile or nonvolatile. Stocks may then be evaluated one against another
by their betas and historical volatilities, statistical data easy to obtain. “Betas” and
“volatilities” are dealt with in Chapters 24 and 42.

In line with this more current thinking, there is another question for readers of
this book and that is the choice of trading (or investment) instruments for the long-
term investor. That question is taken up by the editor in Chapter 20.1.

The Kind of Stocks We Want —
The Long-Term Investor’s 
Viewpoint

Changing Opinions About Conservative Investing

Virtually  no  one  invests  like  the  conservative  investor  described  above  in
Chapter 20 — except perhaps trust departments of antediluvian banks. There
may be some investors still out there who are so risk averse that they still
follow the method described. Bank trust departments may be still doing it.
They  used  to  do  it  so  the  trust  beneﬁciaries  couldn’t  sue  them.  Of  course,
they  should  be  sued  for  incompetence.  But  that  is  the  reason  trust  depart-
ments exist, in order to give legal cover (the so-called “prudent man rule”)
to  trustees  in  case  of  suit  by  beneﬁciaries.  Most  enlightened  trust  depart-
ments and trustees now probably follow indexing or other more productive
strategies in order to cater to new understandings of the prudent man rule.
A beneﬁciary of a trust which has been mismanaged or has radically under-
performed the market should certainly seek redress.

“Indexing”  refers  to  the  practice  of  constructing  a  portfolio  so  as  to
replicate or closely reproduce the behavior of a widely followed index such
as  the  S&P  500  or  the  Dow–Jones  Industrials.  These  portfolios  never  track
the Indexes exactly because the advisors and funds who manage them take
management fees and expenses. These fees are generally less than fees and
expenses  on  actively  managed  funds,  but  in  fact  are  not  necessary  for  the
private investor to pay. Unnecessary because even the tyro investor can now
use “Index Shares” (e.g., DIA, SPY, QQQQ, etc....) or other proxy instruments
to do what the funds and professionals do. Essentially what indexing does
is track the Averages, a strategy which was impossible or difﬁcult (expensive)
(EN9: In the opinion of this editor
when Magee examined it, as in Chapter 15. 
hiring  a  management  company  to  run  an  indexing  strategy  is  imprudent  and  a
waste  of  capital.  Much  better  for  the  investor  to  invest  directly  AND  to  exit  the
market when uptrends end and reverse. This is a much better strategy than “passive
indexing”which  cleverly  manages  to  capture  both  lossses  and  proﬁts  in  the
Averages.)

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

The Kinds of Stocks Long-Term Investors Want

Perhaps one of the most important actualizations of this eighth edition is to
bring  current  this  book’s  treatment  of  the  Averages,  noting  that  it  is  now
possible to trade the Averages in stock-like instruments. This fact deserves
to  be  marked  as  an  vitally  important  development  in  modern  markets.  The
importance, if it is not obvious, was explained in detail in Strategies and Tactics
for  the  Long-Term  Investor,  Chapter 18.1.  This  chapter  will  conﬁne  itself  to
describing facilities for trading and investing in the Averages and Indexes.

In  1993  the  American  Stock  Exchange  (AMEX)  introduced  trading  in
SPDRs™  or  Standard  &  Poor’s  Depositary  Receipts,  an  Exchange-traded
unit  investment  trust  based  on  the  S&P  500  Composite  Stock  Price  Index.
The AMEX  calls  these  securities  Index  Shares™,  a  name  they  also  use  for
other similar instruments. As noted above, large investors and funds have
long  traded  “baskets”  of  stocks  representing  the  S&P  500,  obviously  an
activity  requiring  large  capital.  And  in  fact  a  certain  class  of  investment
managers and funds have practiced “passive investing” meaning indexing,
primarily for large clients.

The purchase and liquidation of these and other “baskets” is one form

of “program trading.”

Recognizing  the  utility  of  this  investment  practice,  the  AMEX  created
the SPDR as a proxy instrument to allow the smaller investor to practice the
same  strategy.  The  effectiveness  of  this  product  introduction  may  be  mea-
sured  by  public  participation  in  the  trading  of  the  SPDR  (SPY).  By  2000,
almost $15 billion was invested in SPDRs with more than 100,000,000 shares
outstanding. These units allow the investor to buy or sell the entire portfolio
or  basket  of  the  S&P  500  stocks  just  as  he  would  an  individual  stock.  But
the capital required to do so is radically reduced.

In  1998,  the AMEX  introduced  DIAMONDS™  (DIA),  Index  Shares  on
the  Dow–Jones  Industrial  Average™,  which  is  analogous  in  every  way  to
the SPDRs. Thus an investor may “buy the Dow–Jones Industrial Average.”
So  in  current  ﬁnancial  markets,  it  is  possible  to  “buy  the  market,”  unlike
those conditions under which Edwards and Magee operated.

Construction of the Index Shares and Similar Instruments

1

10 

/

The AMEX unit investment trusts are constructed to replicate the composi-
tion of their base instrument. The SPDR, for example, is an instrument which
represents 
of the full value of a basket of the S&P stocks and trades on
the AMEX,  just  like  a  stock.  Other  characteristics  of  stocks  are  also  repro-
duced.  Long  life:  the  SPDR  Trust  lasts  into  the  22nd  century.  Quarterly
dividends:  quarterly  cash  dividends  are  paid  on  the  SPDRs  reproducing
dividends  accumulated  on  the  stocks  of  the  S&P  500.  Even  dividend  rein-
vestment  is  possible,  and  the  units  may  be  traded  on  the  AMEX  during
regular trading hours. Under normal conditions, there should be little vari-
ance in the price of the SPDR relative to the S&P 500.

These  elements,  as  discussed  for  SPDRs,  are  common  to  all  the  Index
Shares — DIAMONDS, WEBs, etc. There are, of course, some expenses and
costs  to  using  the  Index  Shares  —  a  small  price  to  pay  for  the  use  of  the
instrument, and generally less than the costs of a fund. Index Shares are also
much more ﬂexible for the independent investor. Among other advantages
the  private  investor  can  control  the  tax  consequences  of  his  investment,
which is not possible in funds.

Other  Exchanges  have  created  similar  security  instruments  or  deriva-
tives or futures to replicate or track the well-known averages and indexes.
Among these are tracking shares or index shares or futures (let us call them
“instruments”)  on  other  indexes  (Russell,  Nikkei,  etc.)  or  options  on  the
futures or indexes until there is a bewildering array of instruments available
for trading, investing, and hedging. Among the more important exchanges
and instruments traded are the Chicago Board of Trade (futures and options
on  futures  on  the  Dow);  the  Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange  (futures  on  the
S&P,  Nikkei  225,  Mini  S&P  500,  S&P  Midcap  400,  Russell  2000,  and
NASDAQ 100);  Chicago  Board  Options  Exchange  (S&P  100  and  500
options)….  This,  by  no  means,  is  an  exhaustive  list.  All  the  futures  and
  under
options  which  matter  will  be  found  listed  in 
Futures Prices, or Futures Options Prices.

Wall  Street  Journal

The

This  book  does  not  deal  in  comprehensive  detail  with  futures  and
options.  But  it  is  worth  mentioning  these  exchanges  and  their  futures  and
options products because of the facility that they offer the investor and trader
for hedging portfolios in Index shares and Average trading, not to mention
opportunities for speculating.

Brieﬂy,  hedging  is  the  practice  of  being  neutral  in  the  market.  That  is,
one might be long the DIAMONDS and buy a put option on the DJIA at the
Chicago Board of Trade, meaning that advances in the DJIA would result in
proﬁts in the DIAMONDS, and a loss of premium in the put. Conversely, a
decline  in  the  Dow  would  result  in  proﬁts  in  the  put  and  losses  in  the
DIAMONDS. As this area is not the province of this book, this is a highly
simpliﬁed description of a hedge. Nevertheless, the reader should see and
understand that hedging can be a very important strategy. Hedging can take
the place of liquidation of a portfolio when the analyst recognizes a change
of trend or unstable conditions but does not wish to incur taxes, or wishes
to defer them.

An Outline of Instruments Available 
for Trading and Investing
It  would  be  herculean  to  attempt  to  list  the  entire  panoply  of  averages,
indexes,  futures  and  options  available  for  trading  —  herculean  due  to  the
fact that new trading instruments are constantly in creation, and due to the
fact that, now operating at Internet speed, we may expect the rate of change
to accelerate. In addition to those listed above, there are WEBS (World Equity
Benchmarks — meaning that exposure to world markets may be arranged).

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

In all, approximately 30 or more Index Share units or instruments were
available for trading on the AMEX at the turn of the century, in addition to
DIAMONDS and SPDRs. Similar instruments exist on the Philadelphia and
in Chicago, and others are being created daily. In order to reduce the con-
fusion, the general investor will probably ﬁnd the major indexes of the most
importance.  The  more  instruments  one  deals  with  the  more  complicated
become  the  strategy  and  tactics.  Therefore,  the  Dow,  the  S&P  500,  and  the
NASDAQ composite (DIA, SPY, QQQQ) are probably sufﬁcient for the pur-
poses of the gentleman (or gentlelady) investor. The Mid-Caps, the Nikkei,
etc., etc., begin to come into play when the trader begins to try to catch sector
rotation, fads, short-term cycles, etc.

The Importance of These Instruments: Diversiﬁcation, 
Dampened Risks, Tax, and, Most Important, 
Technical Regularity

It would be difﬁcult to underestimate the importance of these new trading
instruments. First of all, they afford the private investor what was previously
reserved for the large capital trader — the ultimate in market diversiﬁcation.
The S&P 500 represents stocks comprising 69% of the value of stocks on the
NYSE.  Buying  it  is  literally  buying  the  American  economy.  The  30  Dow
Industrial stocks represent the most important symbol in the American econ-
omy — and perhaps in the world. Investors are well advised to pay attention
to  both  averages  if  they  would  fare  well  in  the  markets.  Note  the  plural:
markets
. These two averages now have the inﬂuence or clout that once the
Dow alone had to express the state of the markets and stocks in general.

Buying the SPDR or DIAMOND then represents the immediate acqui-
sition of a diversiﬁed portfolio. And buying the NASDAQ or QQQQ gives
one immediate exposure to the more speculative and volatile sector of the
American  economy.  Given  the  long-term  bullish  bias  of  the  averages  and
the American economy, it is difﬁcult to argue with this as both strategy and
tactics for the long-term investor. This does not mean that positions should
be taken blindly without thought, or that positions should not be monitored.
On  the  contrary,  recall  if  you  will  the  record  of  the  Dow  Theory.  Even  for
the long-term investor, Bear Markets should not be allowed to destroy liquid-
ity  and  equity  value.  These  questions  are  discussed  at  greater  length  in
Chapter 18.1.

While  we  believe  these  instruments  are  good  vehicles,  it  is  wise  to
remember  Magee’s  frequent  admonition  (less  important  now  than  when
spoken) that it is a market of stocks, not a stock market. Meaning that when
the  tide  is  ﬂowing  down  with  the  Dow  and  S&P,  prudence  and  care  must
be used in taking long positions in stocks which are in doubt as to direction.
And  it  is  worth  noting  that  investments  in  these  instruments  will  be  less
proﬁtable than an astutely chosen individual stock. For example, Qualcomm
appreciated  approximately  240%  (temporarily)  in  1999–2000  compared  to

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AU3772_book.fm  Page 387  Saturday, November 18, 2006  5:29 PM

Chapter 20.1: The Long-Term Investor’s Viewpoint

387

about 24% in the S&P over the same period. Those who bought Qualcomm
at  its  top  and  sold  it  at  the  bottom  of  its  reaction  lost  about  75%  or  about
$148 a share. Traders in Qualcomm tended to obsess and pay hyperattention
to the stock, while investors in the SPDRs reviewed it once a week or less,
or  told  their  computers  or  their  brokers  to  give  them  a  call  if  it  broke  the
trendline, or entered stops. Then they slept at night and had eupeptic digestion.
Other  advantages  accrue  to  the  trading  of  the  SPDRs.  Ownership  of  a
fund  can  result  in  tax  liabilities  as  managers  adjust  portfolios  to  reﬂect
changing membership in the fund or withdrawals in capital by irate stock-
holders. Since Index Shares last into the 22nd century the long-term investor
has no need to realize gains and pay taxes. Bear markets may be dealt with
by hedging with other instruments — futures, options, or proxy baskets of
stock,  or  individual  stocks,  and  accepting  the  tax  consequences  of  these
trades.

John Magee aptly observed before the direct trading of the averages was
possible that the Dow–Jones Industrials were very regular and dependable
from the technical point of view. This observation is annotated at some length
in comments on Dow Theory in Chapters 5.1 and 36. So the investor in the
Index  Shares  may  have  a  smoother  time  technically  than  a  trader  of  an
individual stock.

Summary

The  long-term  investor  and  mid-term  speculator  attempt  to  capture  long
secular (as well as cyclical) trends in the markets. They shun frequent trading
and capital-eroding transactions.

They recognize that risk ﬂuctuates with time and trend and they know
that  frequent  turnover  beneﬁts  mainly  the  broker.  The  strategy  of  the
long-term investor may be to match the market by using funds or SPDRs or
baskets.  But  he  does  not  like  to  participate  in  bear  trends.  He  hedges  or
liquidates his positions on major trend shifts. And in fact he may even short
the indices if his analysis indicates major bear markets.

If he desires to outperform the market (which will happen automatically
if he follows the methods of this work), he ﬁnds some individual speculative
stocks to trade in addition to his foundation portfolio. Depending on his risk
tolerance, he may always be somewhat hedged. When long the indices, he
ﬁnds some stocks in downtrends to short. When he is short the indices he
ﬁnds some strong stocks to hold long. There is no excuse for a moderately
skilled and reasonably capitalized investor to lose money over the long term
in the market.

Selection of Stocks to Chart

The trader who operates on the “fundamental” basis, making his commit-
ments on his analysis of earnings, dividends, corporate management, pros-
pects  for  the  industry,  etc.,  will  usually  (of  necessity)  conﬁne  himself  to  a
few stocks or a single group of stocks in the same ﬁeld.

To  the  contrary,  the  technical  trader,  using  daily  charts,  should  have  a
large portfolio of issues. Since he is primarily interested in the technical chart
patterns, he will not try to make an exhaustive study of the background of
each  company.  In  fact,  the  characteristics  of  the  stocks  themselves,  as  they
act  in  the  market,  are  more  important  to  him  than  what  these  companies
make or what they are earning. This is because, although the stocks represent
ownership  in  the  company,  the  capital  structure,  “leverage,”  and  ﬂoating
supply of the stock may (and very often does) mean ﬂuctuations in the stock
price  that  are  not  directly  in  proportion  to  changes  in  the  affairs  of  the
business.

You will also ﬁnd many cases where the stock of a well-regarded, well-
managed,  long-established  concern,  whose  latest  earnings  report  shows
increased proﬁts, and with a long record of dividends paid, would not be a
good  buy  at  the  market  price.  It  may  be  overpriced  and  due  for  a  serious
depreciation.  You  will  ﬁnd  other  cases  where  a  stock,  which  apparently
represents no great promise of either earnings or dividends, suddenly starts
a series of spectacular moves upward, and is indicated clearly as a buy. Of
course,  the  answer,  in  each  case,  is  that  the  records  available  apply  to  the
past,  not  the  future;  and  very  often,  chart  action  will  indicate  the  inside
knowledge  of  those  who  are  in  possession  of  facts  the  public  has  not  yet
received.

To  change  our  example  to  something  more  easily  visualized:  there  are
two houses for sale. One is a ﬁne, well-built, modern home in an attractive
part of town at, say, $200,000 — and the other property, a somewhat shabby
six-family tenement in a less attractive section, at the same price of $200,000.
There is no question which is the “better” house. But in a case like this, the
market  for  well-built  single  homes  at  this  price  may  be  poor,  while  the
demand for apartments may be good. The six-family house may be the better
investment.

And then again, we have the question of what is conservative and what
is  highly  speculative.  It  is  not  always  enough  to  judge  from  the  type  of
business of the company itself. You may have a highly conservative concern,

carrying  on  a  stable  volume  of  business,  with  a  long  record  of  successful
operation.  And  yet,  if  there  are  bonds,  debentures,  preferred  stocks,  and
other senior obligations, the common stock may be subject to wide ﬂuctua-
tions. Also,  if  the  issue  is  small,  or  if  a  large  part  of  it  is  closely  held,  you
will have a “leverage” effect which results in wide swings in the stock.

Therefore, in choosing your stock to chart, you will want to consider the
kind  of  stock  and  its  character  and  habits  in  the  market,  rather  than  the
business  of  the  concern  it  represents.  We  will  come  back  to  this  point  and
show you how you can shape up a list that will give you the kind of stocks
you want for trading.

Meanwhile,  the  question  “How  Many  Charts?”  has  been  left  hanging.
One answer to this is that the more stocks you chart, the more good oppor-
tunities you will have. Many stocks, even of active issues, will go through
long periods when the chart tells nothing — when, indeed, there is nothing
much  to  tell.  In  a  period  of  stability,  the  chart  simply  indicates  that  it  is  a
period of stability, and the only possible trading activity would be purchases
and  sales  at  the  Bottoms  and  Tops  of  its  undulations.  The  charts  are  more
informative when a change in the situation occurs; they will signal a change
of trend as soon as (and usually before) the news of the changed conditions
has come out. If you have enough charts, you will always have some stocks
making decisive and clear-cut moves either up or down, at any time.

You  should,  therefore,  keep  as  many  charts  as  you  can.  Don’t  bite  off
more than you can chew, however. A man with only 15 minutes to half an
hour a day for this work might have to conﬁne himself to 20 or 30 charts. It
would be much better if he could have 100. And if he is in a position to give
a  major  part  of  his  time  to  the  work,  he  could  very  well  run  as  many  as
300 charts. A most important word of caution is indicated here. Don’t start
anything you can’t ﬁnish. It is better to have too few at the beginning than
too many. Then, if you ﬁnd that you can add others, you will be in a better
position,  from  your  experience,  to  pick  out  the  ones  you  want  to  include.
But if you start with too many charts, begin to run behind with your analyses,
you  will  not  be  getting  the  best  use  from  your  portfolio,  and  it  would  be

manual chartist. The modern computer-equipped investor has a different problem.
He can chart every issue in the market every day. The question becomes, how many
can  he  effectively  study  and  analyze?  There  is  even  a  computer  answer  to  this
question. Namely, the cybertrader can program the computer to report stocks on an
exception  basis.  For  example,  “Computer,  show  me  all  the  stocks  which  are  above
their 50-day moving average and which have unusual volume.”

From what we have already been over, you know that it is possible to
chart  anything  that  is  sold  in  identical  units  in  a  free  competitive  market.
This includes, of course, all kinds of commodities, bonds, debentures, when-
issued contracts, etc., as well as stocks. You may have some special interest
which will call for charting something outside the ﬁeld of stocks. Well and
good.

In general, however, you will want to chart active, listed stocks of well-
established  corporations.  There  is  no  reason  an  unlisted  stock  cannot  be
charted, but ordinarily, the only ﬁgures you can obtain on it are the bid and
offer prices. On these stocks, you do not have a published statement of the
volume of sales each day or any record of prices at which sales actually took
place, and those are essential to the charting of daily technical action. There-
fore, you will usually be charting stocks which are listed on some exchange.
This is also an advantage, since concerns listed on the larger exchanges are
required to meet certain conditions, publish certain information, and comply
with  deﬁnite  rules  and  practices.  In  this  book,  most  of  the  examples  have
been  taken  from  stocks  listed  on  the  New York  Stock  Exchange.  There  are
thousands  of  issues  traded  on  the  NYSE,  and  these  stocks  represent  every
type  of  security,  from  the  most  conservative  to  the  most  speculative,  from
the  cheapest  to  the  most  expensive,  and  they  include  every  principal  type
of industry and business. However, there is no reason that stocks should not

ad inﬁnitum

In choosing your stocks, you will probably look for the greatest diversity in
the 
 of industry. Since you are not specializing in the detailed study of
a single group, you will try to get stocks from as many different groups as
possible. You will want to include mines and oils, rails and chemicals, liquors
and amusements, airlines, utilities, techs, Internets, biotechs, 
….
The  reason  for  this  is  simply  that,  very  often,  many  stocks  in  a  particular
industrial group will show the same or similar patterns, as the entire industry
is affected by certain Major conditions. You will often ﬁnd, for instance, that

when Allis-Chalmers

followed  by  a  sharp  upward  move,  Deere 
Moline, Harvester, and Case will make similar Triangles, or possibly Rect-
angles or some other Consolidation Pattern, followed by a similar upward
move. When Schenley is moving in a long downtrend, you will very likely

each

Therefore,  unless  you  plan  to  keep  enough  charts  to  include  several
stocks of 
 important group, it is best to pick your stocks to make up as
widely diversiﬁed a list as possible. In this way, during times when certain
groups are moving indecisively, or are inactive, you will have some repre-
sentation in other groups which may be active. (Do not infer from this that
all  stocks  of  a  group  move  together  at  all  times.  Individual  concerns  will
frequently move according to special inﬂuences that bear on a single com-
pany.  But  where  the  Major  inﬂuence  is  some  industry-wide  condition,  the
group will move more or less as a unit.)

We,  therefore,  choose  stocks  representing  a  wide  variety  of  groups  or
basic industries. But, suppose we are limited as to the number of charts, and
we must choose one stock from a group; which stock to choose? Suppose,

percentage

If you examine the past records of stocks you will ﬁnd that, in general,
the lower-priced issues make much larger 
 moves than the higher-
priced stocks. It is not unusual for a stock selling around 5 to make a rise of
100%, moving up to 10 sometimes within a few weeks. On the other hand,
you do not ﬁnd 100% moves in days or weeks among the stocks selling at
100 or 200. The same industry-wide move which carries your $5 stock from
5 to 10 might carry your $100 stock from 100 to 140. Obviously, if you had
put  $1000  into  outright  purchase  of  the  stock  at  5,  the  move  would  have
increased  the  value  of  your  stock  100%  or  $1000.  In  the  other  case,  if  you
had  put  the  same  amount  into  a  stock  at  100,  the  move  to  140  (although
many  more  points)  would  have  increased  your  capital  to  only  $1400.  The
gain  in  the  lower-priced  stock  would  be  about  two-  and  one-half  times  as
great.

The  authors  have  worked  out  and  tabulated  the  percentage  moves  of
large groups of stocks over long periods of time (cf. Appendix A), and have
  average  sensitivity  of  stocks  at  dif-
set  up  a  table  which  shows  the 
ferent price levels. This table pertains only to the price level of stocks; thus,
the  same  stock  which  today  sells  at  5  and  makes  wide  percentage  swings
will not swing so widely when it has moved up to a price level of 20 to 30.
Several questions may come to your mind at this point. Do not the costs
of trading low-priced stocks relative to higher-priced issues have to be taken

into account? 
the Internet economy, calculation of those costs here would be tantamount to wasting
trees. This cost question may be researched quickly and easily given availability of
google.com and the Internet.

In selecting the price level of the stocks you prefer to trade in, you cannot
set  too  arbitrary  a  limit,  since  there  are  other  factors  to  consider,  and  you
may have to make some compromises on one score in order to get what you
want  in  some  other  direction.  Stocks  from  20  to  30  are  in  a  good  trading
price range. Very often, you will ﬁnd stocks in the 10 to 20 range which are
so interesting you will want to chart them, and trade in them. You will ﬁnd
good  situations  in  stocks  selling  at  30  to  40.  Furthermore,  you  will  under-
stand, of course, that the stocks which are now selling at 10 may be selling
next  year  at  40,  or  vice  versa.  And  since  you  cannot  be  changing  your
portfolio of charts all the time, you must not be too “choosy” in picking the
price  range  of  your  stocks.  However,  you  would  not  ordinarily  pick  out  a
stock that was selling far above the price range of most stocks of its group,
say at 150, when several others in the same industry were selling at 15, 28,
or 37. For the high-priced stock, as we have said, is likely to be sluggish as

a trading medium. On the other hand, you would not take the very lowest-
priced  issues  of  the  group,  selling  at,  say,  4  or  2  when  others  were  in  the
10 to 30 bracket. You would not only be faced with erratic and tricky chart
action,  and  much  higher  percentage  costs  for  commissions;  but  you  might
not be able to operate on margin at all. There are, from time to time, limita-
tions  on  the  amount  of  margin  on  stocks  at  all  levels.  In  the  lower-priced
issues,  these  limits  are  often  more  stringent.  And  in  the  lowest-priced

the  general  margin  requirement  has  been  50%.  The  Fed  came  in  for  some  sharp
criticism  for  not  dampening  speculation  in  the

margin rates to 100%, and its lack of action exacerbated the blow off of 2000. A
change in margin rates should get the immediate attention of the tecnical analyst.
Something will be up.

ﬁn  de  siècle 

Ordinarily, you will get the greatest effective leverage at some point in
the  20s,  considering  all  these  factors.  And  your  trading  can  run  down
through the teens and up through the 40s. Above 40 and below 10, you will
have to have strong reasons for trading, which might be, of course, ample
capital.  It  would  therefore  be  best  for  the  moderately  ﬁnanced  investor  to
choose a majority of his stocks from the middle price range (10 to 40), plus
only  those  special  situations  you  are  particularly  interested  in  watching
among the very low and very high brackets.

However, if you will go back to the long-time past record of any group
of stocks, you will ﬁnd that even among stocks moving at nearly the same
price levels today, there are widely different behavior patterns. You will ﬁnd
that some stocks respond to a severe market setback by reacting, let us say,
20% — that is, if they were selling at 30, they would move down to around
24. And  you  will  ﬁnd  others  that  will  respond  to  the  same  setback  in  the
general market by a reaction of 50% — that is, if they were selling at 30, they
would end up at around 15. And you will notice, if you examine the records,
that the same stocks which make these relatively different reactions in one
setback  will  make  about  the  same  moves,  relative  to  each  other,  in  other
setbacks. Furthermore, the same ones which make only moderate corrections
on declines will make only moderate advances on rises. And the ones that
go down sharply on setbacks will also skyrocket in a Bullish Market. This
has nothing to do with the phenomenon we discussed earlier, by which we
saw that cheap stocks move faster than expensive stocks. This is due to the
habits  of  particular  stocks,  and  these  habits  seem  to  be  quite  stable  over
periods of many years.

We  will  ﬁnd,  for  instance,  volatile  and  speculative  issues  which  make
larger percentage swings than most other stocks at their price level. And, on
the other hand, we will ﬁnd a stock, selling for much less, that has smaller
percentage  swings  than  most  stocks  at  its  price  level.  This  fact  may  be
obscured, as the comparatively low-priced stock may actually make larger
swings than the higher priced. It is only when we have taken the price level

into account that we can see what the individual habit of the stock really is.
Knowing this, we can project that habit to other price levels.

We  are  not  too  interested,  as  we  have  said  before,  in  stocks  which  do
not ordinarily make substantial moves. We are very much interested in those
which make the wider moves. We can compute the basic swing power of a
stock, which we call the Sensitivity Index, and will outline the method for

a “Sensitivity Index,” may be regarded as the historical predecessor of what are now
called “betas.” The beta of a stock compares its relative volatility to that of the market
as  a  whole,  so  that  if  the  beta  of  the  market  is  1.00  and  the  beta  of  the  stock  in
question is 1.50 a move of $1 in the market will probably be matched by a move of

So,  you  will  have  eliminated  from  your  list  stocks  at  the  wrong  price
level and stocks without enough swing power (for you want to chart only
those stocks in which you can trade proﬁtably). Of the ones that are left, you
will eliminate others. You will ﬁnd that some stocks, which make wide price
moves  and  apparently  offer  large  opportunities  for  proﬁt,  may  be  very
“thin.”  The  charts  will  be  spotty,  ﬁlled  with  gaps,  days  of  “no  sale,”  and
moves  of  several  points  on  only  a  few  hundred  shares  of  business.  These
stocks  are  thin  because  of  a  small  issue,  because  of  ownership  of  a  large
block  of  shares  by  some  corporation  or  by  insiders,  or  for  other  reasons.
They are difﬁcult to trade in because they are hard to buy and hard to sell;
you  stand  to  lose  heavily  on  the  “spread”  between  bid  and  offer.  It  might
be hard to liquidate even 500 shares without driving the price down badly,
to your loss, and sometimes you will see changes of 1 or 2 full points between
sales  of  single  hundreds.  These  you  will  want  to  eliminate,  and  if  you  do
not  know  the  habits  before  you  choose  your  portfolio,  you  will  probably
ﬁnd it worthwhile to drop any stocks that prove too thin, substituting new
and more dependable choices.

After  you  have  culled  the  list  from  all  these  angles  you  will  ﬁnd  you
have left a choice of a number of stocks, all of them selling in a price range
that  is  attractive,  all  of  them  sufﬁciently  active  and  responsive  to  market
trends,  and  all  of  them  available  in  sufﬁcient  supply  to  provide  a  good
trading medium. The ﬁnal choice of any one (or several) of these stocks is
then a matter of personal preference.

and  indicators.  In  fact,  if  the  investor  desires,  rather  than  trading  an  individual

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

In this connection, if you are not planning to represent all groups, there
are  some  groups  that  are  more  likely  to  provide  good  trading  stocks  than
others.  The  foods  and  tobaccos,  for  example,  are  generally  less  responsive
to market swings than the rails, liquors, and airlines, which are very respon-
sive. Do not worry too much, however, about exactly which stocks to choose.
For even if you took the ﬁrst 50 or 100 stocks in the listed issues, you would
have among them at least 25 good trading stocks. You can start with almost
any list, and, as time goes on, you will drop some and add others, improving
your portfolio and tailoring it to your own needs.

EN: As additional commentary here it is worth noting that “techs,” “biotechs”
(or whatever the mania of the moment is — probably space hotels and intergalactic
travel in this millennium) will present areas of risk and reward sufﬁcient to excite
the 17th century tulip trader. The centered investor and trader will consider vogues
and  manias  as  he  chooses  his  active  portfolio  and  choose  to  participate  (or  not)
depending on his appetite for risk and excitement. Or as the popular maxim has it,
one man’s champagne is another man’s poison. This question is pursued in greater
detail in Chapter 23.

By way of further simpliﬁcation, the investor may choose to follow only one or
two issues — the SPDRs (SPY) or DIAMONDS (DIA). If it were not only bought,
but also sold, or hedged, the market would be outperformed. This would be a simple
investor’s life indeed.

Choosing and Managing 
High-Risk Stocks: Tulip 
Stocks, Internet Sector, 
and Speculative Frenzies

Nothing could more vividly illustrate the timeless nature of chart patterns
and  situations  than  the  Internet  stocks  which  bloomed  at  the  turn  of  the
century.  These  stocks  repeated  that  eternal  pattern  —  the  tulipomania,  the
gold rush, the can’t-fail-opportunity-to-get-rich-quick.

It is almost impossible to resist comparing the speculative frenzy which
took place in the Internets and technology issues to the famous 17th century
mania which Holland experienced in the famous tulipomania. In MacKay’s
Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of
undying classic account (
Crowds
),  the  trading  of  tulip  bulbs  replaced  sober  commerce  and  business
as the occupation of the country, and enormous fortunes were made trading
the tubers. Blocks of real estate, breweries, assets of real and large value were
traded for one tulip bulb. And MacKay produced my favorite paragraph in
the  literature  of  ﬁnance:  “A  golden  bait  hung  temptingly  out  before  the
people, and one after the other, they rushed to tulip-marts, like ﬂies around
a  honey  pot.  Every  one  imagined  that  the  passion  for  tulips  would  last
forever,  and  that  the  wealthy  from  every  part  of  the  world  would  send  to
Holland, and pay whatever prices were asked for them.”

That mania ended in ruin. A better long-term prospect may be in store
for the Internets as there is a basis of technology and economic substance to
the  sector.  You  could  not,  after  all,  use  your  tulip  to  check  the  market  for
prices. And, in fact there were those, admittedly a small number, who struck
it rich in the California gold rush of 1849. It’s an ill wind, etc….

But as an exercise in rueful perspective, the seventh edition of this book
remarked,  in  the  words  of  Richard  McDermott,  “Companies  like  Lotus  or
Microsoft  went  public  and  grew  into  business  giants  in  a  short  period  of
time….  A  signiﬁcant  theme  stock  for  the  1990s  has  been  Internet  stocks.
Names  like  America  Online,  CompuServe,  and  Netscape  have  provided
important products and services that allow individuals to ‘surf the net’ for
information around the world.” Young students of the market will search in
vain for Lotus, CompuServe, and Netscape in the lists of stock symbols. The

giant  Lotus  was  swallowed  by  IBM,  in  part  because  Microsoft,  a  ruthless
competitor,  disemboweled  it.  CompuServe  and  Netscape  disappeared  into
the belly of a larger ﬁsh, AOL, with some of the same factors involved. Later
Microsoft got its comeuppance — halving in value as the U.S. Justice Depart-
ment brought successful antitrust action against it.

There are those who fault the great Wall Street investment banks for having
brought half-baked potatoes (or unblooming tulips) to market. The Street ﬁrms,
cashing in on the mania, were willing to sell the public every immature prof-
itless idea and company named “dot.com inc” that venture capitalists ﬂoated
on a sea of seed money. Mining engineers will recognize the phenomenon of
“salting the mine.” It was the ﬁnest moment for the great old ﬁrms of the Street
since the investment trusts of the 1920s. The reader is most recommended to
 by John Kenneth Galbraith to compare the Street
look into 
ﬁrms’ behavior from one mania to the next. It will be found most edifying. At
the pinnacle of great manias, no one can be trusted.

The Great Crash 1929

Managing Tulipomanias and Internet Frenzies

In a time of excess, the centered investor maintains his composure and focus.
Probably  easier  said  than  done.  Nonetheless,  many  investors  and  traders
proﬁted from the Internet boom or were not severely damaged. Many man-
schaden-
agers and traders watched with envy from the sidelines, and with 
freude

 when the bubble burst.

For technical analysts speculating and trading according to the principles
of this book, important opportunities arise in speculative frenzies and buying
panics  —  namely  important  proﬁts  may  be  made  by  remaining  calm  and
methodical  while  the  uninformed  and  naive  cause  speculative  blow-offs.
And, speculative blow-offs have some things in common with the ends of
great bull trends in substantive issues.

So the question becomes that of realizing some of the proﬁts to be made
in  these  exciting  times.  Of  course,  the  ﬁrst  thing  to  do  is  not  get  excited.
These manias come and go — sometimes they are called biotechs, sometimes
computers,  sometimes  Internets,  and  probably,  at  some  point,  human
genome miracle drugs or Martian real estate. It should be emphasized that
these proﬁts are to made on both sides, long and short. The crowd will only
think  of  the  riches  to  be  made  long.  Professionals  and  skilled  technicians,
professional or not, will take the proﬁts on the short side.

all
Here is the most important concept in trading these runaway issues: 
of the techniques and methods described in this book remain valid for dealing with
these kinds of stocks.
 In addition, here are some other points which should be
taken  into  consideration.  The  sector  in  question,  tech-tech,  web-tech,  bio-
tech, Internet, space travel, whatever, will be a market unto itself, and special
technical factors will apply to it. The phases of market lives, accumulation,
attraction, mark up, mania, blow-off will occur in compressed time spans —
much  shorter  than  the  cyclical  life  of  an  issue  with  fundamental  data  to
attach it to reality (cf. Figure 205.2 of Palm Computing).

Multitudinous  lessons  in  Microsoft.  But  short-lived  joy.  The  top
rounds  over,  price  makes  another  attempt,  and  then  the  momentum  is  clearly,  if
puzzlingly down. The cancellation of the runaway day in January deﬁnitely marked
this move as a bull trap, and the short-term trendline from October would also have
taken the trader out of the trap. Use of basing points technique (Chapter 28) would
also have allowed escape from the trap. Failed signals, as this one, often are excellent
signals for a trade in the other direction.

By the time the IPO occurs, the insiders are already prepared to begin the
distribution  phase.  For  example,  when  Palm  Computing  was  spun  off  from
3Com in 2000, only 3% of the shares were sold — creating an artiﬁcial scarcity
and propelling it to absurd heights — so that Palm attained an instant market

value greater than that of 3Com which owned most of its stock. 
since The Fall, learned of “laddering.” In order to let their inside clients in on the IPO
some of the underwriters required the clients to buy more of the stock in the open market
after  the  IPO  at  higher  prices.  A  clever  way  to  throw  gasoline  on  a  raging  bonﬁre.
Whether Palm was laddered or not is not known.

These  issues  must  be  traded  with  the  utmost  care  and  attention.  For
example, it is the height of foolishness to enter a market order to buy on the
issue of the IPO. An issue going public at 12 might trade on the opening at
50 in these frenzies — a sign to the savvy technician that the sheep are headed
for the shearing shed.

Certain factors must be kept in mind. Some IPOs collapse shortly after
going public. Others rocket off before distribution is complete. So stops must
be  carefully  computed.  Once  it  is  clear  that  the  rocket  is  taking  off,  as
indicated by price and volume, some discreet pyramiding might be possible
for the experienced and skilled speculator.

Monthly.  It  is  easy  to  lose  perspective  when  looking  at  a
daily chart of a bull trap in which one has lost a leg. A monthly long-term look at
Microsoft can help restore perspective. Unfortunately, the Dow–Jones Company was
looking at this chart, not the nearby, when they added Microsoft to the Dow 30 in
2000. Expert timing? At the time the John Magee Newsletter observed that it was a
negative indicator of a major top in the Industrials.

Detailed Techniques for Management 
of the Runaway Issues

The technique described in Chapter 28 for progressive stops is certainly one
way of dealing with these stocks. There the method for ﬁnding basing points
and raising stops based on the 3-days-away rule is detailed. Also, especially
in the case of these rocket stocks, the practice of raising stops based on new
percentage highs should be implemented. Since these are “game” situations,
and irrational, one may employ tactics that he might not ordinarily use with
his  serious  capital —  some  light  pyramiding  and  some  scaling  out  of  the
position based on continuous new highs. Additionally in the blow-off phase
when close monitoring is necessary, one might want to exit on a long reversal
day, or on a key reversal pattern (see Chapter 10.1), and then go to the beach.
Or, if from Texas, one might want to short the issue.

The editor learns a lesson. Never leave a chart unanalyzed, even
if the implications are obvious. And never be afraid to belabor the obvious. Obviously
Figure 205.1.1 should have had a long-term trendline drawn on it. No monumental
bull market should be ignored. Why give the market its money back? It should have
been obvious from Figure 205.1 that the Microsoft party was over and not just the
fat lady but the entire chorus was beating on anvils. And. The protective line must
be drawn. Here the broken line at A is the most important and saves a bit of capital
rather  than  waiting  for  the  plaintive  signal  at  C.  Given  the  robust  bull  market  in
Microsoft  the  long-term  investor  might  have  been  justiﬁed  in  waiting  until  the  C
trendline was broken. A matter of investing style and philosophy. There appears to
be  some  long-term  support  at  18.  And  the  5  year  sideways  market  appears  to  be
resolving itself into a macro triangle which might breakout one way or the other in
2005. This is a case in which an investor might make a fundamental analysis to guide
his  position  (always  conﬁrming  with  the  chart  analysis).  Microsoft  is  beset  with
howling  wolves  on  all  sides.  Linux,  Unix,  sales  of  only  one  copy  of  Windows  in
China,  hackers  playing  hob  with  security  holes  in  its  software.  Can  it  rise  again?
Only the chart knows for sure, and it is silent at this recording.

Essentially, I view these stocks as interesting aberrations in the early part
of their lives. So I would not look for long-term investment type trades. Take
the money and run. In all likelihood, these stocks will explode like ﬁreworks
and then expire. There will, of course, be the Microsoft and — it remains to be
seen — the Yahoo. After the ﬁreworks show, the patient technician may return
to the scene of the crime to see if there are any burning embers. Once they have
blown off, crashed, and made reasonable bottoms, then one begins to look for
investment possibilities, which there will deﬁnitely be. The technology of the

And

, in the beginning it behooves the trader to regard them as specula-

tive instruments of exceptional risk and opportunity.

Several caveats are in order.

One, that the prudent speculator does not commit too much of his capital

to such enterprises. Probably no more than 5–10%.

Two,  when  selling  them  short,  one  should  not  be  early. A  deﬁnite  top
should be seen, because there might be a second stage of the rocket.
Three,  emotional  involvement  with  tulips  and  Internet  stocks  —  or

Dealers palmed all the missing capital in PALM? Somebody made

instead  of  three  as  like  an  insidious  amoeba  PALM  divided  into  two  tulips  PLMO
and PSRC. Keep you eye on the magician closely. For the analyst all the smoke and
mirrors could not hide the fact that gravity took PALM in all its manifestations down.
The downtrend lines are broken in 2003 and 2004 and a respectable Kilroy Bottom

it eventually goes IPO at 85 in an innovative public offering. Then the fun
starts. Future readers of this book may observe the mark up made as of the

Amazon  weekly. Amazing Amazon  dances  in  the  Internet  follies.
The breathtaking plunges are the direct result of the breathtaking speculative excess.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

AMZN (Amazon.com, Inc.)

© 2002-2006 Prophet Financial Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

FIGURE 205.7.1.
Amazon daily. In cases of speculative blow-off, trendlines are of
little use. A dozing trader (presumably it was obvious that this was not an investment
issue) would have been mauled in the plunge. An alert trader, knowing that in blow-
offs the procedure is to sell strength, might have avoided it. Other techniques include
recognition of the second exhaustion gap and exit. Also a trader using the techniques
described  in  Chapter 28,  setting  progressively  tight  stops,  might  have  avoided  the
fall.

ruler. A  clear  top  for  the  rational  analyst  with  clear  broken  trendlines  and  broken
horizontal lines and then a clear bear market with a clear bottom resembling a Kilroy
Bottom and then a clear breakout and another bull market and then another down-
trend. Talk about your fearless bull riders down at the rodeo. But this bull/bear is
ridable with a little technical analysis. Without technical analysis it’s like being the
target in a shooting gallery. A sitting duck.

cepts the downtrend in progress at a gap (a coincidence of indicators which occurs
too  often  to  be  a  coincidence),  the  trendlines  drawn  later  are  of  such  strength  that
even the novice analyst should know how to exit. And, in fact, one of my students,
an employee of Cisco, did just that, saving himself thousands of paper dollars in this
very case.

FIGURE  205.8.2.
You  thought  all  the  tulips  and  bulls  had  been  exhausted  in  the
tulipomania in 2000? Silly you. There is an inexhaustible supply. All you need is a
company  and  a  story  and  an  underwriter  to  peddle  it.  Sometimes  there  are  even
earnings. Sometimes the earnings are even real. Sometimes the earnings are skating
uphill on roller blades. And sometimes the characters are so appealing that you are
almost willing to buy the IPO at face value. But not if you are a cynic as all technical
analysts are. Google was rumored at $200 or more on the IPO. The editor offered to
sell all of it at that price and throw in the Brooklyn Bridge for free. This offer (well,
there may have been other factors also) knocked the IPO down to $85 (still an arrant
speculation), but only insane, not unreasonable. The oversubscription in an innova-
tive  offering  revealed  that  the  tulip  virus  was  not  dead,  but  very  much  alive  and
infecting not just the same old suspects, but many new ones. We love a horse race
and this is a great one. Notice the obvious defensive lines and support and resistance.
How long Google can defy gravity (a galactic P/E ratio) remains to be seen. Prudent
gamblers will have a stop identiﬁed. On this chart, for the long-term gambler it might
be  in  the  182  area.  For  the  more  agile  gambler  it  might  be  failure  of  the  support
around  204,  or  closing  of  the  breakaway  gap  there.  No  opprobrium  is  attached  to
the-term  gambler.  In  fact  bolder  investors  (competent  readers  of  this  book)  should
take a ﬂyer from time to time with about 5% of their capital. This, of course, is the
ﬂyer  which  should  have  been  taken.  The  breakaway  gaps  in  October  and  April,
operating against disbelief, were signals of enormous technical strength. And Google
ad inﬁni-
went to 475!! The lesson here, which must be learned and relearned and…
tum

… is: Trust the chart. Ignore the story.

The Probable Moves 
of Your Stocks

At  ﬁrst  glance,  all  stocks  appear  to  move  helter-skelter  without  rhyme  or
reason, all over the lot. All stocks go up at times, and all go down at times —
not  always  at  the  same  time.  But  we  already  have  seen  that  in  these  rises
and falls stocks do follow trends, make various typical patterns, and behave
in a not completely disorderly manner.

It is also true that each stock has its own habits and characteristics, which
are more or less stable from year to year. Certain stocks normally respond
to  a  Bullish  Phase  of  the  market  with  a  very  large  upsurge,  while  others,
perhaps in the same price class, will make only moderate moves. You will
ﬁnd that the same stocks which make wide upward swings are also the ones
which make large declines in Bear Markets, whereas the ones that make less
spectacular up-moves are more resistant to downside breaks in the market.
In  Appendix  A  you  will  ﬁnd  in  a  discussion  of  Composite  Leverage  that
there are stocks which ordinarily move many, many times as fast as others.
We  do  not  know,  for  example,  whether  a  year  from  now  Glenn  Martin
(EN: Read, Microsoft, Ebay)
 will be moving up or down, but we do know, and
it is one of the most dependable things we know, that whichever way it is
going, it will be covering ground much faster than American Telephone and
(EN9: Even T accelerated into hyperspace after its ill-advised divestment
Telegraph. 
of local Bells. And, unlike the leopard, completely changed its spots.) 
These differ-
ences of habit, of course, are due to the size of issue, ﬂoating supply, nature
of business, and leverage in the capital structure, matters we have touched
on brieﬂy before. As a matter of fact, we are not especially concerned with
why the differences exist. We are interested mainly in what the differences
are, and how we can determine them.

This  is  important:  stocks  which  habitually  move  in  a  narrow  range,
although excellent for investment purposes where stability and income are
the  chief  desiderata,  are  not  good  trading  stocks.  A  fairly  high  degree  of
sensitivity 
, with wide percentage moves, is necessary in order
to make possible proﬁtable commitments that will cover costs and leave a
net  gain.  In  order  to  be  in  a  position  to  make  a  proﬁt,  you  should  see  the
probability of at least a 15% move in your stock.

(EN: volatility)

How  then  are  you  going  to  tell  which  stocks  are  most  sensitive  and

potentially most proﬁtable?

FIGURES  206  and  207.
Some  stocks  move  faster  than  others.  We  have  already
noticed that low-priced stocks have much larger percentage moves than high-priced
issues.  But  even  between  two  stocks,  which  may,  at  a  particular  time,  be  selling  at
the  same  price,  there  are  enormous  differences  in  their  habits.  Furthermore,  these
habits change very little from year to year.

Here we have a weekly chart of Corn Products Reﬁning Company (left), covering
an  18-month  period  in  the  years  1945  and  1946. Also  a  chart  of  Schenley  Distillers
(right)  for  the  same  period.  The  average  price  between  the  high  and  low  on  these
charts is about 64

,the same for both stocks.

 and 100, a range of 71

However, during this period, we see “CFG” moving between a low of 58

 and a
 points, while at the same time, “SH” has moved between
high of 71, a range of 12
½
28
. A thousand dollars put into outright purchase of “CFG”
at its extreme low would have grown to $1210 at its extreme high, whereas the same
amount used for outright purchase of “SH” at its low would have grown to $3510.
Your gain of $2510 in “SH” would be more than 10 times the gain of $210 in “CFG,”
and this without using margin.

½

It  is  not  likely,  of  course,  that  you  would  actually  purchase  either  stock  at  the
extreme low, nor sell at the extreme high. The point we are bringing out here is that
there are enormous differences in the swing habits of stocks.

Individual stocks have their characteristic habits, and so do some entire industries.
In general, the food stocks, of which “CFG” is one, are stable and slow-moving. On
the other hand, liquor stocks make wide moves on any general advance or decline
of the market. At this time “CFG” had a Sensitivity Index 
of
0.58, whereas Schenley’s was 2.05.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

By examining the record of a certain stock for a number of years back,
and comparing the percentage moves it has made with the percentage moves
of the market as a whole, you can obtain a fair picture of that stock’s habits.
You  will  not  be  able  to  say,  at  any  particular  moment,  “This  stock  is  now
going  to  move  up  25%,”  but  you  can  say,  with  a  good  deal  of  conﬁdence,
“If the market as a whole makes an advance of 10%, this stock will probably
advance  about  25%.”  Or,  conversely,  of  course,  “If  the  market  goes  down
10%, this stock will very likely go down at least 25%.”

Many methods have been used for measuring and checking these per-
centage-move  habits,  differing  only  in  detail.  Indexes  on  several  hundred
important  stocks  listed  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  have  been  com-
puted by the authors and are presented in Appendix A.

EN: Current day betas may be compared with these and/or substituted for them
in  other  computations  suggested  in  this  book,  for  example  in  Composite  Leverage
formulas. The reader may read in the following text “beta” for “Sensitivity Index”
and avoid the annoyance of excessive notation by the editor.

(EN: beta)

The Indexes are relative. They show that stocks with a high Sensitivity
Index 
 will move much faster in either Bull Markets or Bear Markets
than  stocks  with  low  Indexes,  and  about  how  much  faster,  relative  to  the
other stocks.

EN: As  is  obvious  to  the  experienced  reader,  and  new  to  the  inexperienced,
Magee’s method predates the compilation of 
systematic
 of a stock, or for those who are not into ﬁnancial industry jargon, the sensitivity
risk
of a stock to the market. Thus, if the market moves one point, a stock with beta of
1.5  will  move  1.5  points.  And  a  stock  with  a  beta  of  .5  will  move  a  half  a  point.
Approximately. Or more or less. For readers who like to roll their own, I offer here
the formula for computing the beta of a stock, which is somewhat more sophisticated
than Magee’s method:

 measures the 

betas. Beta

(

(

N Sum of  XY

)(

)

(
) − (

)(
Sum of  X Sum of  Y

)

)

where
N =  the number of observations 
X =  rate of return for the S&P 500 Index 
Y =  Rate of return for stock or fund. 

The general investor may not be avidly interested in this calculation, especially
when the beta is readily available at Value Line and is published regularly by Merrill
Lynch. 

Of  equal  or  greater  importance  is  the  individual  risk  of  a  stock  which  profes-
sionals  like  to  determine  by  computing  its  volatility.  Somewhat  akin  to  Magee’s
“normal  range  for  price,”  volatility  measures  the  variability  of  a  stock’s  returns
(price movement). The general investor should be informed that the study of vola-
tility is an extremely sophisticated subject, and that professionals expend enormous

resources dealing with the question. Numerous methods are used to derive volatil-
ities, but these mainly come into play in options arbitrage and professional trading
on exchange ﬂoors.

For  the  private  investor  it  is  sufﬁcient  to  know  of  the  dangers  of  this  arcane
area. Before venturing into “volatility plays,” the newcomer should take a postgrad-
uate  course.  For  the  general  investor  who  wants  to  know  enough  to  calculate  his
own volatilities (not recommended or necessary), I note the formula here:

To calculate the volatility of a portfolio, ﬁrst ﬁnd the difference between each return
and the average. Then square each difference and add them together. Divide the sum
by the number of returns minus one. This result is known as the variance. Finally,
take the square root of the variance to get the volatility. Combining these steps into
a formula:

n

• Step 1: Calculate the average return.
• Step 2: Calculate the deviation of each return.
• Step 3: Square each period’s deviation.
• Step 4: Add them together.
• Step 5: Divide the sum by the number of periods – 1. This is the variance.
• Step 6: Take the square root.

Two Touchy Questions

This  chapter  is  directed  largely  to  the  new  trader,  to  the  investor  who  has
followed other analytical methods, and to the investor type who is now, for
the ﬁrst time, taking up the technical trading of stocks for the shorter term.
The ﬁrst question here is the use of margin. There are many people who,
knowing of the disastrous margin calls of 1929 and the staggering way losses
can be multiplied against one in a margined account during a sharp break
in  the  market,  take  the  attitude  that  the  use  of  margin  is  intrinsically  bad,
dangerous, foolish, and unsound. They will tell you that they are willing to
risk  their  own  money,  but  they  never  speculate  on  borrowed  funds.  They
will tell you that by buying securities outright, they are safe against any kind
of break in the market.

There  is  something  to  this  line  of  argument,  although  very  often  you
will ﬁnd that the arguer has not really thought the case through all the way.
If he had, he might realize that, in buying outright stocks which are sensitive
or  highly  leveraged,  he  is  accomplishing  almost  exactly  the  same  thing  as
someone  else  who  buys  more  conservative  stocks  on  a  margin  basis.  Very
often,  despite  his  feeling  that  outright  purchase  is  more  conservative  than
margin  buying,  he  is  a  speculator  at  heart.  He  is  not  really  interested  in
dividends and a stable investment. Rather, he is looking for “something with
appreciation opportunity.” And because he is not facing the issue squarely,
he may fall into expensive errors.

To  be  thoroughly  consistent  here,  a  man  who  shuns  the  risks  inherent
in margin trading should shun the risks of leverage and volatility. He should
avoid  risk,  forget  “opportunity  for  appreciation,”  and  conﬁne  himself  to
sound, income-producing stocks of a sort that will not ﬂuctuate widely.

If we are looking for stability, we do not want excessive ﬂuctuation. And
there  are  securities  that  provide  stability.  In  this  work,  however,  we  are
looking  for  “swing  power.”  We  want  the  highest  degree  of  ﬂuctuation  we
can  handle  safely.  We  can  secure  this  by  buying  outright  a  stock  that  is
normally subject to fairly broad swings; that is, a stock with a high Sensitivity
.  We  can  get  the  same  effect  by  trading  in  a  stock  of  more

Let  us  assume,  for  example,  that  we  will  buy  100  shares  of  a  rather
speculative  stock,  which  we  will  call  UVW,  on  an  outright  basis.  It  has  a

Sensitivity Index of 1.50, and now sells (let us say) at 20. At the same time,
we  buy  a  somewhat  less  speculative  stock,  XYZ,  also  selling  at  20;  but  in
this case, we buy on 70% margin, putting up only three quarters of the value
of the stock. In a general advance affecting both of these stocks, the proba-
bilities would favor a somewhat greater percentage move in UVW than in
XYZ. If such a general rise should bring UVW to 30, we might expect XYZ
to  rise  to  a  lesser  degree,  say  to  28.  Now  the  advance  of  10  points  on  the
$2000 invested in outright purchase of LVW will represent a gain of $1000
or 50%. The advance of XYZ to 28 on the $1400 invested at 70% margin will
mean a gain of $800 or 57%. In other words, we have, by the use of margin,
increased the effective leverage of XYZ; made it, in fact, slightly more spec-
ulative than UVW.

The effect of margin use is simply to accentuate or increase the sensitivity
of a situation. It is a mechanism for assuming more risks and, therefore, more
opportunities for faster gains. Assuming you are willing to assume risk (as
you must be if you intend to make speculative commitments), it is simply
a matter of knowing approximately what risks you are taking and whether
you can afford to take them. The danger in margin lies in cases where the
customer grossly overextends himself, taking on a risk far beyond his ability
to protect himself. This will not happen if he sets a reasonable limit to his
total leverage 

(EN: put another way, his portfolio risk)
.

The  margin  transaction  is  simply  a  matter  of  buying  (or  selling  short)
more stock than you have money to pay for in full. The purchase of a home
on a mortgage is essentially a margin transaction. The ﬁnancing of business
operations, using borrowed money for part of the capital, is the same. The
buying  of  anything  where  the  purchaser  puts  up  part  of  the  capital  and
borrows the rest, using the value of the purchased property as security for
the loan, is exactly similar to the trading of stocks on margin. In each case,
any change in the value of the property will cause a larger net change in the
 capital. Thus, if a man buys a home for $100,000, paying
value of the 
$50,000 cash, and later sells it for $150,000 (an increase of 50% in the value
of  his  property),  he  will  beneﬁt  to  the  extent  of  $50,000  proﬁt,  or  100%  on
his invested capital.

margin

The question of margin calls, being “wiped out” on margin transactions,
will seldom, if ever, come up if you protect yourself properly by maintaining
stops at all times or by closing out the transaction when it has violated certain
predetermined danger points. Needless to say, if you have allowed a trade
to  go  so  bad  that  it  has  reached  the  minimum  margin  maintenance  range,
the best thing is to take your loss and forget it; not try to meet the margin
call. But again — this need not ever happen.

As we will see in discussions of sensitivity and leverage, stop levels, etc.,
there are certain limits which can be fairly well deﬁned, beyond which you
cannot safely venture. If you could buy stock on a 10% margin, as you could
at one time, you might have visions of highballing a thousand dollars up to
a million in one Bull Market. But that is not a reasonable hope, and it is not

Short Selling

The other touchy question is that of short sales. A majority of traders avoid
the short side of the market. Six out of seven you meet, who have bought
or sold stocks, will tell you that they would never sell a stock short under
any conditions, at any time. In fact, short selling is limited, very largely, to

fund rules requiring them to maintain only long positions. Even with this develop-

disadvantage of the nonprofessional.

Winning the Mental Game on Wall Street,

Now, if you have studied long-term charts (weekly and monthly), and
the daily charts in this book, you will recognize several facts about the action
of  markets.  Most  stocks  go  up  most  of  the  time.  There  are  almost  always
more advances than declines in the list of most active stocks published each
day. Stocks, in general, advance about two thirds of the time, and go down
(EN9: Probably a truth over the long term, but
only about one third of the time. 
in the modern context ample short opportunities exist.)

Furthermore, most of the news releases, rumors, and comments in the
press related to stocks and corporate affairs have to do with the brighter side
of  industry.  It  is  only  natural  that  executives,  public  relations  people,  and
the reporters themselves should be interested in forward-looking develop-
ments,  new  processes,  expansion  of  facilities,  increased  earnings,  and  the
like; and that such items should prove more newsworthy than less optimistic
reports.

These various factors may explain why “the public” is always Bullish.

And, yet, examination of the long-term charts, covering the action of the
Averages over many years, will show you that through these long periods,
the levels rise and fall about the same amount.*

This being the case, it must follow that stocks come down as far as they
go up, and since they go up about two thirds of the time, they must come
down much faster than they go up. This you will ﬁnd is true. The angles of
decline in the Averages and also in individual stocks are usually steeper in
Bear Market Moves than the advances are in Bull Market Moves. A corollary
can be made faster on the downside
 of the market than on

Such proﬁts are made by 

. It is important if you are a trader
that you understand the meaning of a short sale. When you sell a stock short,
you borrow that stock from someone who owns it, and then you turn around
and sell it to someone else, agreeing with the original owner to replace his
shares at some unspeciﬁed time in the future. All of the detail of this trans-
action is, of course, handled by your broker. Shares of most stocks of large
outstanding issue are available for loan at all times in the hands of brokers,
and your own broker has access to them. The mechanics of this borrowing
and  sale  are  interesting;  you  may  wish  to  get  from  your  broker  the  whole
story  of  how  these  operations  are  carried  out.  For  all  practical  purposes,
however,  all  you  need  to  do  is  tell  your  broker  what  you  wish  to  sell  and
leave the rest to him.

He  will  advise  you  if,  by  any  chance,  the  stock  you  have  selected  for
short sale is not available for loan. Another practical point, although of minor
consequence,  is  that  a  slight  additional  tax  is  assessed  against  short  sales.
EN: In that gains on short sales are not eligible for long-term capital gains tax.

It is important also, if you are a trader, that you accept opportunities to
sell short as readily as you go long stock. Unfortunately, there are psycho-
logical barriers to short selling. There are, for example, the unintelligent and
entirely irrelevant slogans about “selling America short.” There is the feeling
on  the  part  of  many  who  are  poorly  informed  that  short  selling  is  the
somewhat  unethical  trick  of  the  manipulator.  Others  have  the  impression
that, in selling short, one is hoping to proﬁt by the misfortunes of others at
times  of  disaster  and  Panic.  It  is  not  the  purpose  of  this  book  to  persuade
anyone to sell stocks short, any more than it is our purpose to advise anyone
who  shouldn’t  to  speculate  on  the  long  side  of  the  market.  But  so  many
questions are constantly raised, even by fairly sophisticated investors, about

 In spite of the long-term “secular trend” and the history of these recent

 in the Average, it seems safe to assume that there will continue to
be  major  general  declines  in  the  future  as  there  have  been  in  the  past. As  a  matter  of  fact,  a

the  ethics,  as  well  as  the  practical  procedure  of  short  selling,  that  we  may
perhaps be pardoned for saying a few more words in its defense.

All of the popular ideas about short selling mentioned in the preceding
paragraph  may  be  branded  as  so  much  nonsense.  There  is  nothing  more
reprehensible about selling short than buying long. Each is a speculation in
relative  values.  The  truth  is  that  money  is  a  commodity,  just  as  much  as  a
share of stock. There is no moral or practical difference between borrowing
money to buy stock because you believe that the latter will go up in value
in terms of the former, and borrowing stock in order to “buy” money because
you believe the latter is going to go up in value in terms of the former. In
each case, you are obligated eventually to repay the loan whether it be money
or stock. In each case, you are taking a risk on the basis of your considered
forecast as to the future trend of 

 values.

relative

There are, in fact, many common business practices which are more or
less analogous to selling stocks short. For example, every time the publisher
of  a  magazine  accepts  cash  in  advance  for  a  subscription  he  is  making
something like a short sale. His ultimate proﬁt or loss will depend on what
the  magazines  he  will  eventually  supply  have  cost  him  by  the  time  the
subscription runs out.

When  you  sell  stocks  short,  you  (or  rather  your  broker)  receives  the
proceeds  of  the  sale  at  once  but  you  are  obligated  to  turn  back  an  equal
number of the same shares at some future date to the man from whom the
EN: One of the advantages or edges that pro-
stock certiﬁcates were borrowed. 
fessionals enjoy over private investors is the credit of short sales to their accounts
and the payment of interest thereon. While the proceeds are credited to the private
investor, no interest is generally paid on it, unless the investor has inﬂuence with
the  broker.  A  favorable  situation  is  created,  however,  in  that,  if  a  short  sale  of
$100,000 were made on, say, 50% margin, a credit of $150,000 would be made to
his  account,  and  no  interest  would  be  charged.  Any  dividends  the  trader  paid  on
the transaction would be expensible.
 Consequently, sooner or later, you have to
go  into  the  market  again  and  buy  those  shares.  When  you  buy  them,  you
(or  rather  your  broker)  returns  the  shares  to  the  original  lender,  thus  dis-
charging  your  obligation.  If  the  cost  of  your  purchase  was  less  than  the
proceeds of the earlier sale, the difference is your proﬁt. If it costs you more
to  buy  in  the  shares  —  or  as  it  is  termed,  cover  your  short  —  then  the
difference  represents  a  loss.  Of  course,  you  do  not  enter  into  a  short-side
transaction unless you expect the price of the stock to go down and, hence,
show you a proﬁt.

One of the little-appreciated results of a large volume of short selling is
actually  to  strengthen  the  market.  Every  short  seller  is  a  potential  buyer.
Most  short  sellers  are  glad  to  cover  and  take  their  proﬁts  on  a  relatively
Minor Decline. Consequently, if there is a big short interest at any given time
in a particular issue, that means that there are many people waiting to buy
that stock when it goes down. This situation tends to “cushion” bad breaks.
Some astute operators will actually buy a stock when they learn that there
is a very large short interest in it (that is, that a great many shares of it have

been sold short and not yet covered) because they realize that competition
among the short sellers to buy the stock whenever it has a small decline may
result in a very fast and proﬁtable Short-Covering Rally. Any stock is stron-
ger, technically, if there is a good-sized short interest in it.

There  is  one  further  objection  raised  against  short  selling.  It  will  be
pointed  out  that  when  you  buy  stock,  your  loss,  if  worse  comes  to  worst,
can  be  no  more  than  the  total  amount  you  paid  for  it.  But  in  the  case  of  a
short sale, the price of your stock could, theoretically, rise against you to $50,
$100, $1000, $10,000 a share; in other words, could rise without limit. This
argument sounds much more alarming than it really is. Certainly there is no
occasion  to  lose  sleep  over  it.  Stocks  do  not  go  up  without  limit  all  of  a
sudden. It is just as easy to set a stop on the loss you are willing to take on
a  short-side  transaction  as  it  is  on  a  long  purchase.  Such  situations  as  the
famous  1901  corner  in  Northern  Paciﬁc  are  not  likely  ever  to  occur  again

occur but extremely rarely in big liquid issues. A famous short squeeze occurred in
the silver markets of the 1980s when the Hunt brothers trapped Exchange members
and almost bankrupted them. The Members, of course, being in control, retaliated
by  quintupling  margin  requirements  and  bankrupted  the  Hunts.
  The  authors
realize that nothing they can say, and probably no amount of cold-blooded
analysis on the part of the reader himself, will remove entirely the trepidation
which  most  nonprofessional  traders  experience  when  they  sell  short.  The
mental hazards will always be slightly greater than in buying long. Never-
theless,  from  every  practical  angle,  a  short  sale  is  exactly  the  same  thing
(although  in  a  reverse  direction)  as  a  long  purchase,  with  no  greater  risk,
with actually somewhat greater chance of quick proﬁt, and differing only in
details of execution.

A commitment in commodity futures contracts, whether long or short,
though quite different in theory, has some similarities to a short sale of stock.
In making a contract, no actual sale takes place, and no loan of either cash
or  the  commodity  is  involved.  Such  a  contract  is  simply  a  binding  legal
agreement to accept delivery or to deliver a certain commodity at a certain
price at a certain time. In this respect, it is 
 from a short sale of stock.
It is also different in that it must be closed out on or before a deﬁnite date.
But the purchase or sale of a commodity contract is similar to a stock short
sale  in  that:  (1)  it  is  necessarily  a  margin  transaction,  and  (2)  it  creates  an
“open” or incomplete transaction which must eventually be liquidated.

different

A short sale of stock must always and necessarily be a margin transac-
tion. Thus, if you buy 100 shares of stock outright at 20, it can sink to 15 and
you cannot be called for more margin. You have lost $500, but the stock is
still  yours.  If  you  sell,  you  get  back  $1500,  disregarding  commissions.  On
the other hand, if you sell a stock short at 20, putting up a margin of 100%,
and  the  stock  rises  to  25,  you  will  also  have  lost  $500.  The  broker,  under
certain  conditions,  such  as  the  100%  margin  requirements  in  effect  at  one
time,  might  call  on  you  for  $500  additional  margin.  Or,  if  the  transaction
were  to  be  closed  out  at  that  point,  you  would  receive  back  $1500  less

commissions,  the  same  as  in  the  long  transaction.  In  the  case  of  this  short
sale, had the price dropped to 15, your proﬁt would have been $500.

On  short-term  moves,  the  effect  of  short  selling  is  exactly  the  same  as
the buying of long stock, but in the opposite direction. You simply apply the
same methods here in reverse, during a Bear Market, that you would use in
a  Bull  Market. As  we  have  already  seen,  the  various  technical  indications
that  point  to  upward  moves  in  a  Bullish  Phase  have  their  counterparts  in
downside signals during a Bearish Phase.

Execution  of  short  sales  cannot  be  made  at  any  time  and  at  any  price
you wish. A short sale must be made in a rising market. You are not permitted

Round Lots or Odd Lots? 
(EN: Or, Put Another Way, Size?)

in  an  odd  lot  position

One of the minor tactical questions bound to plague you is whether to trade
in round lots of 100 shares or odd lots (less than 100 shares in active stocks).
EN: In Internet Age markets this question has virtually lost its relevancy. In
Magee’s time, there was a distinct disadvantage to trading odd lots, and one only
traded  odd  lots  if  hampered  by  limited  capital.  Now  that  an  investor  can  achieve
full  diversiﬁcation 
  by  buying  odd  lots  of  SPDRs  and
DIAMONDs  there  seems  little  point  in  discussing  it.  There  is,  of  course,  always
the  question  of  broker  commission  —  if  the  broker  has  a  ﬁxed  commission  rate
regardless of the size of the trade, then the small investor gets nicked. It would seem
that this follows the old adage that the rich get richer. But now the small investor
can  strike  back  by  ﬁnding  a  broker  who  does  not  charge  commissions.  At  ﬁrst  I
thought that commission-free brokers were making up their proﬁt on volume. But
there are in fact other ways to make a proﬁt on trades than charging a commission —
for example, directing the execution of the orders to a trader who needs “order ﬂow.”
In the Internet Age, the question of what size a trade or investment should be
is different from the question which confronted traders of, as it were, ancient times.
Now it is not so much a matter of cost disadvantage in trading odd lots as it is a
much  deeper  question  —  that  of  risk  and  portfolio  management.  So  how  does  the
aware investor determine the size of any individual trade?

I  am  indebted  to  a  longtime  friend,  colleague  and  broker,  and  fellow  trader,
William  Scott,  for  articulating  the  common  sense  procedure  here  for  calculating
trade size and controlling risk.

First, we determine the percentage of our capital we want to risk on any given
trade.  Among  many  professional  traders  of  our  acquaintance,  this  ﬁgure  is  often
2 or  3%.  For  the  sake  of  illustration,  using  round  numbers,  if  we  have  $100,000
capital this means we will be risking $3000 on a trade. Let us say that we are going
to  buy  a  $20  stock  and  defend  our  position  with  a  stop-loss  order  $5  away.  Our
formula for computing position size is

If  we  were  going  to  accept  a  $10  risk,  our  trade  size  would  be  3000/10  =

300 shares. Thus we adjust our trade size to ﬁt our risk parameters.

This is a simple, practical, elegant way to implement risk control at the indi-

vidual trade level.

Stop Orders

We  are  going  to  take  up  two  kinds  of  stop  orders,  or,  rather,  two  entirely
different uses of the mechanism of stop orders.

First, let us look at the protective stop order. At best, it is not a happy
subject.  Stop  orders  of  this  type  are  like  ﬁre  extinguishers.  The  occasions
when they are put into operation are not times of rejoicing. Stop orders are
used  for  emergency  rescue  when  things  get  so  bad  that  there  seems  no
reasonable hope for a situation.

Wherever you set your protective stop, it is likely to be touched off at
what seems to be the worst possible moment. You will set it at a safe distance
under a certain bottom. The stock will break through, catch your stop, and
then proceed to build a new bottom at this level for the next rise, or to rally
at once and make new highs. No matter. You had your reasons for setting
the stop. The stock did not act the way it should have. The situation is not
working  out  according  to  Hoyle,  and  certainly  not  the  way  you  hoped  it
would.  Better  to  be  out  of  it,  even  at  a  loss,  rather  than  face  a  period  of
uncertainty and worry. If the stock has started to act badly, you cannot tell
how much worse it is going to behave. If you fail to set a stop, you may go
on day after day hoping for a rally that never comes, while your stock sinks
lower and lower, and eventually you may ﬁnd (as millions have found) that
what  started  to  be  a  small  reaction,  and  an  annoying  but  trivial  loss,  has
turned out to be a ruinous catastrophe. Stop orders cannot always be placed.
In certain cases in active stocks, the exchanges may even restrict the use of
stop orders.

The question is where and when to set the stop, realizing that there is
no perfect and absolutely satisfactory rule. If the stop is too close, you will,
of course, take unnecessary losses; you will lose your holdings of stocks that
eventually  forge  ahead  and  complete  the  proﬁtable  rise  you  hoped  for.  If
stops are too wide (too far away), you will take larger losses than necessary
in those cases where your stock deﬁnitely has broken out of pattern.

Now  it  will  be  obvious  that  the  setting  of  stop  orders  depends  on  the
price of the stock and its habits. You would not place your stop level at the
same  percentage  distance  under  a  Bottom  in  a  conservative,  high-priced
stock when it is selling at 80 that you would to protect a speculative issue
at a time when it is selling at 8.

The  higher-priced  stocks,  as  we  already  have  seen,  make  smaller  per-
centage moves. Conversely, the lower-priced stocks make wider percentage

moves. Therefore, the lower-priced stocks should have more leeway for their
gyrations.  We  will  need  a  wider  stop  for  them  than  we  will  for  the  less
volatile “blue chips.”

Similarly, we can take our Sensitivity Indexes 

(EN: Betas in considering a
stock relative to the market, and Volatilities for absolute measure of one stock against
another)
 to give us a picture of the individual habits of the stock. Although
two stocks may be selling at the same price at a given moment, you would
expect  a  high-beta,  high-volatility  stock  to  make  wider  swings  than  a
low-beta,  low-volatility  stock;  therefore,  you  will  set  your  stops  wider  on
the higher-volatility stock.

We must take these factors into account and work out some sort of simple
rule  of  thumb  that  we  can  follow.  Let  us  arbitrarily  assume  an  imaginary
stock of “average” habits and a price of 25. Let us further assume that we
will be satisﬁed, in this particular case, with stop protection 5% below the
last established Minor Bottom.

For  a  stock  of  the  same  sensitivity  selling  at  5,  we  would  need  about
half  again  as  much  stop  leeway  (on  a  percentage  basis).  That  is,  the  stop
. We arrive
would be placed 7.5% below the last Bottom 
at this by taking the normal expected range of an average stock at price 25,
which  is  represented  by  the  Index  Figure 15.5,  and  comparing  it  with  the
normal range of a stock selling at 5, which is 24. These are merely relative
indexes and mean only that the stock selling at 5 will normally move about
24%,  while  the  stock  selling  at  25  is  making  a  move  of  about  15.5%.  We
multiply the basic stop distance of 5% by the fraction 24/15.5, and we get
approximately 7.5%.

(EN9: Signiﬁcant low)

In exactly the same way, we introduce the relative sensitivity of the stock,
using the Sensitivity Index. If this Index should be 1.33, we multiply the stop
distance  again  by  this  ﬁgure  and  get  10%.  In  the  case  of  a  stock  having  a
sensitivity of 2.00 at this same price, our stop distance would be 15%. If the
sensitivity of the stock were only 0.66, we would get 5%.

In any case, the stop distance, expressed as a percentage, is obtained by
dividing the Normal Range-for-Price by 15.5, then multiplying by the Sen-
sitivity Index, and multiplying this result by 5%. (This operation can be done
most easily and quickly with a calculator or computer routine.)

All  of  the  foregoing  may  seem  needlessly  complicated  to  the  average
reader.  We  realize  that  many  will  not  care  to  take  the  time  and  trouble  to
work out an exact, scientiﬁc stop level for each of their occasional commit-
ments. However, the method of determining where stops should be placed
in  a  systematic  and  consistent  way  has  been  given  in  some  detail  here,  so
that the principles involved will be perfectly clear, and so that you can change
or adapt the various factors if you feel your experience justiﬁes changes.

For most ordinary purposes, a simpliﬁed table of stop distances will be
sufﬁcient. This table, which follows, gives you the approximate stop distance
you  would  get  by  the  method  outlined  above,  for  stocks  in  various  price
classiﬁcations and of various degrees of sensitivity.

conservative group.

EN: The  informed  reader  may  consider  an  alternative  to  Magee’s  Sensitivity
Index which I have conjectured here — that is, basing the stop distance on implied
volatility, which would present a dynamic method of adjustment. Implied volatility
is produced from, for instance, the Black–Scholes Model when the model is solved
for volatility rather than price, taking the market price as the given.

The  stop  level  should  be  marked  on  your  chart  as  a  horizontal  line  as
soon  as  an  actual  or  theoretical  transaction  has  been  entered  into,  and  it
should  be  maintained  until  the  transaction  is  closed,  or  until  progressive
stops  (which  we  will  explain  in  a  moment)  have  been  started  in  order  to
close it out. In the case of purchases, the stop level ordinarily will be at the
indicated distance below the last previous Minor Bottom. In the case of short
sales, it ordinarily would be at the indicated distance above the last Minor
Top.

To  determine  the  position  of  this  stop  level,  simply  ﬁgure  what  the
percentage  distance  would  amount  to  at  the  price  of  the  stock.  If  you  are
dealing with a stock selling at 30 and the stop distance comes out 10%, then
allow 3 points under your last Minor Bottom.

To  make  this  even  easier,  if  you  are  using  the  TEKNIPLAT  paper,  you
will see that it is possible to divide each of the two cycles making up a chart
sheet  into  ﬁve  spaces.  If  the  center  of  the  paper  were  numbered  10,  then
these spaces would be from 10 to 12, 12 to 14, 14 to 16, 16 to 18, and 18 to
20. Each of these “jumps” is made up of 16 of the smallest vertical spaces.
In the lowest section, it will take about four of these small spaces to make
5%. It will take ﬁve in the second position, six in the third position, seven
in the fourth, and eight in the top position. You will soon learn to count out
an approximate stop interval of 15% or 8% or 12% at any price level, without
a moment’s hesitation.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

In  no  case  would  we  ever  set  a  protective  stop  level  at  less  than  a  5%

interval, even for the most conservative, high-priced stocks.

These questions remain: “What constitutes a Minor Bottom? What makes
basing point
an established Minor Top? How do we know how to choose the 
(EN9:  cf.  Chapter  28) 
from  which  to  measure  off  our  stop  level  interval?”
What constitutes a Bottom or a Top will be taken up in the next chapter. For
the present, let us accept the proposition that we will determine the correct
basing point and that we will always, always set our stop level at the moment
we make the commitment.

It  is  understood,  of  course,  that  protective  stops  under  long  stock  are
never moved down, nor are protective stops over shorts ever moved up. As
soon as the stock has moved in the right direction far enough to establish a
new basing point, the stop level is moved up (on longs) or down (on shorts),
using  the  same  rules  for  determining  the  new  stop  level  as  were  used  in
ﬁxing the original level.

The Progressive Stop

There is another use of the stop which is properly considered here. This is
the  progressive  stop,  used  to  close  out  a  stock  that  has  made  a  proﬁtable
move, or in some cases where a stock has given a danger signal before either
completing a proﬁtable move or violating a previous Minor Bottom.

You will ﬁnd that on many moves, the stock will progress in the primary
direction for several days, and then may develop exceptional volume. Often,
this occurs just as the stock reaches an important trendline or pattern border
or Resistance Area. This heavy volume means one of two things. Usually it
means that the Minor Move has come to an end, that this is the top of the
rise for the moment. Occasionally, however, the volume may signal the start
of a breakaway move that may run up several (and perhaps many) points,
almost vertically. (The reverse situation, of course, may develop on downside
moves.)

If, noticing the heavy volume following a good rise, and assuming that
this day marks the end of the move, you sell the stock at the market or at a
limit, you are going to be dreadfully disappointed if this should be one of
those  rare  cases  where  the  stock  opens  next  day  on  an  upside  gap  and
continues  3,  5,  or  20  points  up  in  the  following  days.  On  the  other  hand,
experience  will  have  shown  you  that  it  will  not  pay  to  expect  that  sort  of
move very often. You will know that, nine times out of ten, you will be better
off out of the stock.

Very well. After such a day when volume is exceptionally high (provided
this  is  not  the  ﬁrst  day  of  breakout  into  new  high  ground  beyond  the  last
previous  Minor  Top),  cancel  your  protective  stop  and  set  a  stop  order  for
  point  under  the  closing  price.  For  example,  you  have
the  day  only,  just 
bought a stock at 21. It goes up on moderate volume, smashes through the
old Minor Top one day at 23 on very heavy volume, the next day continues
  on  moderate  volume,  the  third  day  advances  on  moderate  volume
to  23

The  morning  after  this  close  at  25,  you  will  notice  the  volume  signal. You
will cancel your protective stop, which may be at 18, and you will place a
stop order, for the day only, to sell on stop at 24
. In most cases, this will
mean  that  your  stock  will  be  stopped  out  on  the  ﬁrst  sale  of  the  day. And
you may get a slightly lower price than you would get with a straight market
order.  On  the  other  hand,  after  a  day  of  high  volume  activity,  you  are  not
likely to be left in a thin market; there should be bids enough, near the top,

A progressive stop of this sort can be indicated on the chart by any mark
you choose to use; for example, a band of short diagonal lines. When a stock
moves for several days in a runaway move, you may repeat this mark each
 point under the close for each successive day,
day, indicating a tight stop 
until  ﬁnally,  one  of  these  stops  is  caught.  In  the  case  of  short  sales,  a  buy
stop is used in precisely the same way as the selling stop we have discussed,
to follow the stock down on a sharp runaway dive.*

This  use  of  stop  orders  is  indicated  wherever  a  stock  has  reached  its
reasonable objective on high volume, or where it has exceeded its objective
and is moving out of the Trend Channel in free air, so to speak, and in some
cases, where the stock has failed to reach its objective.

If  your  stock,  for  instance,  is  rising  in  a  Trend  Channel,  and,  about
halfway between the lower and upper trendlines, suddenly develops great
volume, then a progressive tight stop will protect you against the threatened
failure of the move. Extreme volume in such a case, before there has been a
breakout to a new high above the last Minor High, is deﬁnitely a warning
and a threat. This would be especially true if there were also a gap or a One-
Day Reversal at this point.

* In the case of a stock which has presumably completed its proﬁtable move and has given a
Minor Top signal by volume, you may place a near 
 point) stop
the ﬁrst day. If the stock moves up the next day, without abnormal volume, you may leave the
stop  at  this  same  point  each  day  until  another  “blowoff”  or  Top  signal  appears;  that  is,  until
you see another day of heavy volume, a gap, or a One-Day Reversal, and then move the stop
up to 
 point below the close of that day. This method often works out somewhat better than
the continuously progressive near stop.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

The  one  day  on  which  a  tight  stop  would  not  be  applied  after  heavy
volume had appeared would be the day the stock made a new high, running
entirely  through  the  previous  Minor  Top  and  closing  above  it.  This  action
generally means the move is not yet completed. However, should the move
continue  higher  and  again  show  heavy  volume,  even  if  it  is  the  very  next
day, we would then protect with a progressive stop.

In this chapter, as throughout the book, the expression “heavy volume”
means heavy only with respect to the recent volume of sale in the stock you
are watching. A thousand shares may be signiﬁcantly heavy volume in some
thin issues, whereas 10,000 shares would be no more than a normal turnover
in more actively traded stocks. The volume chart itself will show, by a market
peak, when a day of abnormally heavy volume occurs.

It  should  be  understood  that  the  progressive  stops  we  have  been  dis-
cussing are intended to take short-term gains, or to close out an exceptionally
proﬁtable runaway move terminating in an Intermediate Climax. While the
extreme conditions that call for this type of operation are by no means rare,
they are not the usual, everyday action of the market. In the case of ordinary
Minor Tops, even when they are fairly apparent on the basis of Trend Chan-
nels,  volume  peak,  and  other  indications,  many  traders  and  investors  will
prefer to wait out the expected reaction rather than pay additional commis-
sions and lose a position that is still presumably in a favorable Major Trend.
In  short,  the  progressive  stop  is  a  device  which  may  be  very  useful  on
occasion, but it is intended to cope with a special and somewhat unusual move.
The  protective  stops,  on  the  other  hand,  offer  the  average  trader,  the
man who is not able to spend his entire time studying the market, or who
has not had long experience, a device by which he can limit his possible loss.
He will be protected from his own unwillingness to close out the bad holding,
and so, he will avoid the ruinous condition of becoming frozen into a hope-
less situation. Since he will be taken out automatically, regardless of whether
he has an ultimate gain or loss, he will have the capital to use in better-look-
ing issues and will not have to worry about the prospects of recovery in his
stock after it has gone many points against him.

However, if one has sufﬁcient knowledge and sufﬁcient determination to
get out as soon as the trend has shown convincing evidence on a turn, there is
EN: This  editor  believes  that  only  the  proven

trader-investor should trade without a stop in the market. The reader may determine
if he meets this criterion by examining his portfolio to see if he has ever let a loss run,
or allowed a signiﬁcant proﬁt to slip away. If so he, or she, or they, or it, is not proven.
It is possible for such a person to operate successfully without them; and there
are some advantages in doing this, since a stop order will occasionally be caught
by a false move or an extended dull reaction. There are also advantages in not
using  stop  orders  for  the  experienced  technician  who  is  looking  toward  a
possible long-term gain and who is willing to wait out a Secondary reaction.
But it is a thousand times better for the person who is not sure of his methods
to be stopped out early, then to be left holding a stock bought at, say 60, when
it has declined to 29 — or to 5!

What Is a Bottom — What 
Is a Top?

EN9: In this extremely important chapter I have left intact Magee’s usage of “Tops
and Bottoms.” It will be less potentially confusing for the reader to think of “highs
and lows” as that terminology is commonly used in the business in the modern era.
Also, thinking in terms of highs and lows is an important concept in itself. Thus,
for a bull trend, higher highs, higher lows. And when this pattern is broken in an
important  way  the  trader  should  be  alert  for  a  trend  change.  And,  as  the  use  of
eighths is of the essence in Figure 210, I have left the discussion in eighths while
the reader knows that decimals are now used in the markets.

Intermediate

In this chapter, we are not talking about what makes a Major Top or Bottom,
 Top or Bottom. We are speaking of the Minor
nor what makes an 
Tops  and  Bottoms  that  give  us  important  hooks  on  which  to  hang  our
technical operations. Stop-order levels, trendlines, objectives, Supports and
Resistances  are  determined  by  these 
  Tops  and  Bottoms.  They  are  of
prime importance to us as traders.

Minor

Usually, these Minor Tops and Bottoms are well marked and perfectly
clear. Often they are not. Sometimes, it is not possible to say deﬁnitely that
this or that place is or is not a Top or Bottom. But it is possible to set certain
standards, practical working rules, that will help us in making these points;
and these rules will not fail us too often.

⅛

3 days

A good rule for setting stop levels is to consider that a Bottom has been
made when the stock has moved “three days away” from the day marking
the suspected low of the Bottom. If a stock reacts for some days and ﬁnally
makes a low at 24, with a high for that day at 25, then we will not have an
 in which the stock sells at no
established Bottom until we have had 
lower than 25
. The entire price range for 3 full days must be entirely above
the top price for the day making the low. This is the “three days away” rule,
and  it  would  apply  in  reverse  in  declining  markets,  where  the  range  for
3 days must be entirely below the entire range of the day making the high.
This  gives  a  rule  for  setting  an  original  stop  order.  It  also  gives  a  rule
for  changing  the  stop  order. As  soon  as  the  stock  has  moved  3 days  away
from a new Bottom, we move the stop order to a position below that Bottom.
(We  have  already  explained  in  Chapter 27  how  we  determine  the  distance
this stop level should be below the Bottom.)

The  ﬁrst  protective  stop  would  immediately  be  placed  6%  below  the  previous

stop level at 9

entirely “away” from the September 17 Minor Bottom, and, on September 28, a third
day. We would then move the stop up to 6% under the September 17 Bottom, or to

long

Protective  stops  for 

  stocks  can  move  only  up.  A  stop  level,  once
established, is never to be moved down except when the stock goes ex-div-
idend or ex-rights; then the stop may be dropped the amount of the dividend
or  rights.  Similarly,  protective  stops  for  short  sales  are  to  be  moved  only
down, and may not be raised. (In the case of ex-dividends and ex-rights, the
short-sale stop would be dropped the amount of the dividend or rights.)

There  are  certain  situations  where  it  is  difﬁcult  to  determine  Bottoms
and Tops; where, indeed, it seems as though a Consolidation or Correction
had been made without any signiﬁcant move in the Secondary Direction. In
such cases (as contrasted to the obvious situation where the stock moves up
or down in series of well-marked steps and reactions, like a staircase), you
will need all your judgment and experience to determine where the Minor
Basing Points actually occur.

Basing Points

Basing
Let us call the levels which determine where stops should be placed 
Points
. In a Bull Market Move, we will consider the Bottom of each Minor
Reaction as a Basing Point, from which we will ﬁgure our stop-order level
as soon as the stock has moved up to “three days away.” We will also use
each Minor Top as a Basing Point in a Bull Move. In a Bear Market, we will
consider the Tops of each rally and also each Minor Bottom as Basing Points
for the protective stops, in the same way.

Where a stock makes a substantial move in the Primary Direction, say
a move of 15% or more, and then moves back at least 40% of the distance
covered from the previous Basing Point to the end of the Primary Move, that
surely  gives  us  a  Basing  Point  as  soon  as  the  stock  again  starts  off  in  the
Primary Direction. However, if the stock reacts less than 40%, perhaps even
marks time at the same level for a week or more, that should also be con-
sidered  a  Basing  Point  as  soon  as  the  move  in  the  Primary  Direction  is
continued (provided the volume indications are right).

The  daily  volume,  as  we  have  seen,  is  like  the  trained  nurse’s  clinical
thermometer; it tells a great deal about what is happening in a stock, more

you  may  look  for  exceptionally  heavy  volume:  (1)  on  the  day  of  breakout
from  a  pattern  or  a  period  of  inaction,  especially  if  the  breakout  is  on  the
upside;  (2)  on  the  day  on  which  the  stock  goes  into  new  ground  in  the
Primary or Intermediate Direction, that is, goes above the last Minor Top in
a Bull Market, or below the last Minor Bottom in a Bear Market; and (3) the
day on which the Minor Move is completed or nearly completed, that is, the
new  Minor  Top  in  a  Bull  Market  and  the  Minor  Bottom  in  a  Bear  Market.

To  this  we  might  add  that  extra  heavy  volume  on  any

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Now, after a Minor Top has occurred, the stock now being in new high
ground, and the Top having been made on very heavy volume, we may look
for the corrective move. Ordinarily, that would be a decline of several days,
a  week,  sometimes  longer.  Occasionally,  the  correction,  as  we  said  a  few
paragraphs back, will take the form of a horizontal hesitation lasting a week
or more without any particular corrective move in the downward direction.
Where there is a downward correction, it is likely to come down to or near
the  Top  of  the  last  previous  Minor  High  (support). Also,  and  often  at  the
same time, the corrective move will carry down to the Basic Trendline drawn
through two or more previous Minor Bottoms; or to the “parallel”; or to a
trendline drawn through the last two or more previous Minor Tops. If the
corrective move is horizontal, it is likely to run out until it meets one of these
lines.

In any case, the thing to watch for is the decline of volume. If the trading
shrinks, perhaps irregularly, but on the whole, steadily, for some days after
a new Top has been made, during which time the stock either reacts or, at
any rate, makes no progress in the Primary Direction, then you are justiﬁed
in  considering  this  as  a  Minor  Correction.  If  the  stock  now  continues  the
Primary Move and gets to a point that is “three days away,” you can consider
the Bottom (that is, the point you draw your trendline through, not neces-
sarily the extreme low point in the case of horizontal moves) as a new Basing
Point.

Where  a  stock  is  starting  what  appears  to  be  a  new  move,  a  breakout
from  a  period  of  vacillating  moves,  it  is  sometimes  hard  to  say  precisely
what  point  should  be  considered  the  Bottom.  There  may  be  several  small
and indecisive moves on low volume preceding the real breakout. In such
a case, we would consider the appearance of high volume as the breakout
signal, and set our Basing Point at the low point immediately preceding this
signal. There will usually be such a point on one of the low-volume days in
the 3 or 4 days just before the breakout.

All that has been said about Basing Points in a Bull Market would also
be  true,  in  reverse,  in  a  Bear  Market,  except  that  heavy  volume  does  not
always accompany a downside breakout.

Now there comes the difﬁcult and distressing situation where the stock,
having made a long runaway move (let us assume it is an upward move),
starts  out,  apparently,  to  make  a  Flag,  and  is  bought  after  a  sufﬁcient  cor-
rection  of  40%  with  a  decline  of  volume,  and  then  continues  to  go  down
steadily, without any rallies and without any clear volume indications. This
is  an  unusual  situation,  but  it  does  happen  on  both  the  upside  and  the
downside, from time to time. In the case we have just mentioned, we would
look for Support Levels (Consolidation Patterns, Multiple Tops, etc.) formed
 in the previous trend, and lying below the level at which
on the way 
we purchased the stock. We would use these supports as Basing Points rather
than hold a stop under the extreme Bottom of the vertical move.

down

In many cases of this type, you will not be able to ﬁnd adequate Basing
Points. Therefore, it seems unwise to try to get in on corrections after long

runaway moves except: (1) where the stock has risen well above good Sup-
port  that  can  serve  as  a  Basing  Point,  or  (2)  where  the  stock  is  completely
above all prices for several years and is moving “in the clear.” (The reverse,
of  course:  in  Bear  Markets,  the  stock  should  have  fallen  below  a  strong
Resistance Area, or must be in new low ground for the past several months
before you consider a short sale.) And in any case of this sort where you are
thinking  of  a  trade  in  a  stock  that  appears  to  be  making  a  Consolidation
must
 have pronounced and conspicuous
after a fast, long, vertical move, you 
drying up of volume throughout the formation of the Flag or Pennant Cor-
rection.

There is one more word of caution needed here regarding trading in an
Intermediate Trend. A series of moves in a trend will often take place in very
regular form. There may be a good trendline, and the reactions may be about
40%  to  50%  and  may  come  back  to  the  previous  Minor  Tops.  The  volume
on the Corrections may shrink, with increasing volume on the new Tops. It
is easy to start trading on such a “staircase” in the expectation that the moves
will continue to be regular and consistent. But trends do not go on forever.
Any  Minor  Top  may  be  the  last.  The  importance  of  ﬁnding  your  Basing
Points is to enable you to get out, at best, on any closing violation of one of
these points, and at worst, on your protective stop order. The volume may
again come to your aid in this question of when to stop trading on a trend.
Although  you  look  for  high  volume  on  the  Tops,  you  will  be  exceedingly
suspicious of volume that is 
 higher than that on any of the preceding
Minor  Tops  (or  Bottoms  in  a  Bear  Market).  The  ﬁnal,  or  the  next-to-ﬁnal,
“blow-off” of a trend will usually show more volume than any of the Minor
blow-offs  along  the  way;  and  when  you  see  such  climactic  volume,  you
should prepare to retire into your shell and wait for a full Correction of the
entire series of moves making up your Intermediate Trend. Later, weeks later,
or perhaps months later, you may ﬁnd the stock has corrected 40% or more
of the whole Intermediate Move and is resting quietly with very little activity.
Then is the time to watch it for new opportunities and a new trend in the
Primary Direction.

EN9: In a book composed of nothing but important chapters this Chapter 28 might
not  get  the  emphasis  it  deserves  from  the  unwary  reader.  In  fact  the  procedure
outlined here is of absolutely basic importance in analyzing and trading trends. In
Chapter 28.1 I have added to it material which has been of great importance to my
trading and to the trading of my students.

Basing Points – A Case Analyzed

The  longer  one  thinks  about  the  chart  so  casually  tossed  off  in  Figure  210
the more he realizes that it embodies a profound and natural understanding
of  trends  and  the  market.  Consider  —  wave  up,  wave  recedes;  wave  up,
wave recedes, and so on. As long as the trader or investor is not chased from
his position by the corrective wave he will under normal circumstances ride
the trend to its natural end. But locals and hedge funds and those who proﬁt
from  volatility  know  that  the  previous  low  is  where  investors  and  traders
set their stops. So in the ordinary ﬂow of trading if they see an opportunity
to take out an important low they will do it. If possible. And it is sometimes
possible. And the low sometimes falls from the natural ﬂow of trading. 

Bruce Kovner, on being interviewed by Jack Schwager (

),
was asked where he set his stops. “Where they’re hard to get to,” he said.
A stop set on a basing point with a prudently calculated ﬁlter is hard to get
to, unless the market has truly reversed direction. In fact, what is a long-term
moving average but a lagging stop with a ﬁlter built in?

Market Wizards

And what are Basing Points but the marking of highs and lows in full
realization  that  a  pattern  of  higher  highs  and  higher  lows  is  a  bull  trend,
and  when  that  pattern  changes  to  one  of  lower  highs  and  lower  lows  the
trend is changing, or has changed. This is the principle behind Dow Theory,
and  it  is  the  principle  behind  trading  trends  of  lesser  duration  than  Dow
trends. And, as is quickly realized, a pattern of lower highs and lower lows
means inevitably 

that the trendline has been broken.

As  for  Figure  210,  Mark  Twain  had  some  cogent  comments  on  it.  He
said  that  anyone  trying  to  make  sense  of  it  would  go  crazy,  and  anyone
trying to justify the prices with the chart would be shot. Figure 210 preserves
unexplainable conundrums and conﬂicts carefully preserved since the ear-
liest editions. The reader is urged to take it as a concept rather than using
it as a lesson. And see Figure 210.1. Therefore let me codify the rules implic-
itly presented in the Figure:

1. A high is made, being recognized by no higher prices occurring for

the moment.

2. Prices recede and a low is made. This low is found by watching each
day after the previous high until no lower prices are made. As prices
begin to rise again we note each day on which prices are completely
outside the range of our low day candidate.

3. When  three  such  days  are  observed  before  a  new  low  is  made  we
mark the candidate day as a Basing Point and raise our stop to 6%
(or x%) under the low of the basing point day. (See Chapter 27).
If a new high is 3% greater than the previous high a new Basing Point
is found at the low of the new high day.

4.

The Basing Points Paradigm

By no means will every issue be amenable to this kind of analysis. But the
method is so paradigmatic that it is worth examining at greater length. And
like virtually every other method of classical chart analysis it must be used
with  caution  and  good  and  thoughtful  judgement.  Sometimes  on  some
stocks it will seem to work as smooth as silicon lubricant and on other issues
it will appear to be useless. However, even on recalcitrant issues the princi-
ples  underlying  the  method  will  be  of  use,  if  not  the  actual  method  itself.
With this in mind Figure 210.1 is presented. The careful reader will see that
the chart in this example uses only bottoms or lows in stop setting and does
not advance stops on the making of new highs as in Figure 210. This is done
for  instructional  purposes  and  to  keep  the  example  simple  for  the  general
investor. More advanced traders will want to study and perhaps utilize the
techniques in Figure 210.

Figure  210.1  actually  serves  more  than  one  instructional  purpose.  It
illustrates  a  picture  perfect  case  of  the  use  of  Basing  Points,  and  it  also
illustrates a complete analysis of a bull market from entry to exit with keys
marking  events  in  the  life  of  the  market.  Thus,  the  observation  of  Basing
Points, the setting of the stops, the tracking of potentially false turns are all
noted.  The  chart  is  accompanied  by  the  keys.  Originally  the  marked  and
keyed  chart  was  used  in  graduate  seminars  at  Golden  Gate  University  for
instructional purposes. Shortly it became obvious that marking the chart in
this manner was extremely useful in trading. So it is suggested to the reader
as a way of making his charts more communicative and more useful.

Trendlines in Action

From what has already been said in Part One of this book, you will be familiar
with the characteristic single-line trends of stocks, and the numerous excep-
tions and deviations that come into the picture from time to time. We know
that stocks often move in parallel trends, sometimes for months, occasionally
even for years. We also know that they may, and do, break out of trend or
change the direction of their trends without notice.

Most  of  the  pattern  formations  we  have  studied  can  be  considered  as
manifestations  of  trend  action,  that  is,  as  Continuations  or  Reversals  of  a
trend.

Thus, a Symmetrical Triangle is simply the meeting of two trends. During
the formation of the Triangle, the stock is following both trends in a narrow-
ing  pattern,  until  ﬁnally,  the  dominant  trend  asserts  itself.  An  Ascending
Triangle  is  following  an  upward  trend,  but  has  encountered  a  Resistance
Level at the Top. A Head-and-Shoulders shows the end of an upward trend
and  the  beginning  of  a  downward  trend.  A  Rectangle  is  a  Parallel  Trend
Channel running in a horizontal direction. And so on.

We can project a Parallel Trend, and, in the case of stocks which happen
to continue moving in that trend, we can buy and sell at almost the precise
points of contact with the trendline. Unfortunately, long and perfect straight-
line  trends  of  this  sort  are  the  exception  rather  than  the  rule.  For  actual
trading  purposes  we  will  project  our  trends  more  or  less  continuously  on
the basis of the most 

recently established data
.

From  the  standpoint  of  tactics,  let’s  consider  the  trends  as  they  are
indicated by the successive Minor Tops and Minor Bottoms. For illustration
of  this,  and  as  a  guide  to  what  we  are  leading  up  to,  we  will  consider
simpliﬁed, ideal situations (see diagram examples on the next page).

To  avoid  confusion,  mark  the  top  trendline  in  blue  and  the  bottom
trendline  in  red.  This  can  be  done  on  daily  charts  easily  by  using  colored
pencils. We will refer to the upper trendline as the Blue Trend, and the lower
trendline as the Red Trend. From time to time, we will also want to draw a
line parallel to a Blue Trend across the Bottom of the trend so as to include
a segment of the Trend Channel between two Tops within parallel lines. This
we will call the Blue Parallel, and we will mark it with a dotted or broken
blue line. Conversely, we may wish to draw a parallel to the Red Trend so
as to include the segment of the Trend Channel between two Bottoms; and
this dotted red line we will call the Red Parallel.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

DIAGRAM  3  (Left,  above).
Here  is  a  rising  trend  showing  the  Basic  Trendline
across two Bottoms, which we call the Red Trendline, and its parallel (indicated by
a  broken  line)  through  the  Top  of  the  intervening  peak.  The  parallel  suggests  the
approximate objective of the next move if the stock continues in trend.

DIAGRAM 4 (Right, above).
The same rising trend with the Return Line, which
we  call  the  Blue  Trendline,  drawn  through  two  Tops.  Broken  line  represents  its
parallel through the intervening Bottom. This Blue Parallel is useful in determining
a  buying  point,  especially  in  trends  of  rapidly  changing  form  when  the  stock  may
not react to its Basic Trendline.

DIAGRAM 5 (Left, above).
This is a declining trend showing the Basic Trendline
across  two  Tops,  which  we  call  the  Blue  Trendline,  and  its  parallel  (indicated  by  a
broken line) through the Bottom of the intervening decline. The parallel suggests the
approximate objective of the next move if the stock continues in trend.

DIAGRAM 6 (Right, above).
The same declining trend with the Return Line, which
we  call  the  Red  Trendline,  drawn  through  two  Bottoms.  Broken  line  represents  its
parallel  through  the  intervening  Top.  This  Red  Parallel  is  useful  in  determining  a
point  at  which  to  make  short  sales,  especially  in  trends  of  rapidly  changing  form
when the stock may not rally to its Basic Trendline.

At the start, the stock declines in a Parallel Trend Channel. Blue Trendline is basic
here. A short sale on a rally to the Red Parallel at point A will ﬁnd its objective on
the Blue Parallel at B. Another short sale on the Red Parallel at C would be followed
by failure to reach the objective. Chances are good, however, that increased volume
would develop at the Double Bottom and give warning to get out of short commit-
ments. The upside penetration of the basic Blue Trendline at E, alone, is not sufﬁcient
reason  to  reverse  position  and  go  long.  Trendlines  set  up  during  formation  of  the
Rectangle  would  be  marked  in  the  regular  way,  but  are  indicated  here  by  broken
lines to emphasize the pattern. Another short sale, if tried on the sixth point of contact
with the Rectangle at F, would be stopped out on the breakout.

The trend is now rising, although we cannot yet draw a Basic (Red) Trendline. The
ﬁrst  buy  would  be  made  on  a  40–50%  correction  of  the  breakout  move  from  the
Rectangle, or on a return to the Top (Support) level at H.

A trendline would be drawn to the ﬁrst Bottom established in the Triangle. This
is  not  shown,  as  it  would  ultimately  be  replaced  by  the  line  shown  through  the
outermost point in the Triangle. We have indicated by broken lines the trendlines set
up during the formation of the pattern.

The objective of the breakout move from the Triangle would be the Red Parallel
to our now rising Basic Trendline. This objective is reached at J. A Return Line (Blue)
would be drawn from the ﬁrst Reversal Top of the Triangle at G through the Top of
the breakout move at J, and the parallel to this through point I would indicate about
where to make the next purchase. As a matter of fact, the stock does not actually get
back  to  that  point;  in  practice,  the  purchase  would  probably  be  made  at  K  on  the
basis of a 40–50% correction, or on a reaction to the Support Level G.

The subsequent upward move would not carry through to the Red Parallel marked
W. However, the alarm would probably be sounded clearly by a day of heavy volume,
a One-Day Reversal, or a gap. Since the trend is now obviously convergent, no further
purchases would be considered. The next move fails to make such headway and falls
far  short  of  the  objective  set  by  the  Red  Parallel  marked  Y.  Soon  after,  the  Wedge
breaks out downside.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Since, ordinarily, a Top will be formed after a Bottom and a Bottom after
a Top, we will expect to draw, alternately, a Blue Trendline and then a Red
Trendline,  these  lines  being  drawn  as  soon  as  the  new  Top  or  Bottom  is
established.  (In  some  cases,  a  light  pencil  line  may  be  drawn  to  indicate
suspected Tops or Bottoms, until developments conﬁrm their validity.)

We have already taken up the important and rather difﬁcult question of
determining  the  Minor  Tops  and  Bottoms.  Very  often,  these  points  will  be
clear and obvious. Sometimes they will be obscure, and you will be able to
draw trendlines with conﬁdence, in such cases, only after considerable expe-
rience covering many types of action. The most difﬁcult times to determine
Minor Trends are during Reversals, especially where these are of the rounded
and  irregular  types.  However,  in  these  cases  (of  Reversal),  we  will  not
depend so much on the trendlines to determine buying and selling points.
So  long  as  a  stock  persists  in  a  Parallel  Trend  Channel,  it  is  perfectly
clear that you should buy near the Bottom of the channel and sell near the
Top.  From  the  geometry  of  the  situation  (see  examples),  you  will  see  at  a
glance that it is not likely to be proﬁtable to sell short in an upward-moving
trend (since the reactions are necessarily smaller than the advances), nor to
buy stock in a downward-moving trend.

Therefore,  a  trend  must  show  that  it  is  presumably  an  uptrend  before
you are justiﬁed in buying stock. And you must have what is presumably a
downtrend to justify a short sale.

You  will  notice  from  the  simpliﬁed  examples  shown  here  that  pattern
formations indicate trends. The breaking of a Rectangle on the upside results
in  an  upward  slope  of  the  Blue  Trend.  The  move  up  out  of  an Ascending
Triangle conﬁrms the rising Red Trend and creates a rising Blue Trend. The
downside breaking of a Head-and-Shoulders neckline conﬁrms a descending
Blue Trend and sets up a descending Red Trend. And so on.

From studies of these patterns and various trend actions, we arrive at a
compact set of trading rules based on these Red and Blue trendlines. These
rules are summarized below.

Buying Stock, “Going Long”

•

Preparatory  Buying  Signals
  (indicating  that  a  buying  opportunity
may  be  in  the  making).  Penetration  of  Blue  Trend  to  a  new  high
closing  (in  most  cases).  (The  simple  breaking  of  a  descending  Blue
Trendline,  where  no  other  pattern  or  indication  is  present,  is  not
sufﬁciently conclusive evidence of Reversal to justify commitments.)
– Contact  with  the  ascending  Blue  Trend  if  Red  Trend  is  also  as-
cending, provided the trends do not converge (Parallel or Diver-
gent Trend Channel).

– Contact with horizontal Blue Trend if Red Trend is also horizontal

or ascending (Rectangle, Ascending Triangle).

– Penetration of descending Blue Trend on volume if Red Trend is

ascending (Symmetrical Triangle).

–

Execution of Buys
–

 (after preparatory buying signal).
In  case  the  previous  Blue  Trend  has  been  ascending,  draw  the
Blue Parallel and buy at or near this line.
In case the previous Blue Trend has been horizontal or descending
(that is to say, emerging from Rectangles, Triangles, and various
Reversal Patterns), buy on a reaction of 40 to 45% of the distance
from  the  last  previous  Minor  Bottom  to  the  extreme  Top  of  the
most recent move.

Liquidating, or Selling a Long Position

Immediately  on  execution  of  the  buy  order,  determine  the  stop  level  (see
Chapter 27 on Stop Orders), and place your protective stop. Penetration of
this stop level will automatically close out your transaction. The stop level
may be moved up according to the “three days away” rule, but may never
be moved down (except to adjust for ex-dividend or ex-rights). If the stock
closes  below  a  previous  Minor  Bottom  (thus  setting  up  a  descending  Red
Trend), sell on tight 

(EN: or hair-trigger)

 progressive stops.

If the stock advances on moderate volume and then develops unusually
high volume on any day during the advance before either the Blue Trend is
broken  (with  a  close  above  that  trendline)  or  before  the  stock  has  made  a
new high closing over the last Minor Top, close out the transaction on tight
progressive stops.

If  the  stock  develops  high  volume  on  the  day  on  which  it  either  tops
and  closes  above  the  Blue  Trend  or  makes  a  new  high  closing  over  the
previous Minor Top, hold it. If heavy volume again occurs on the following
day or any subsequent day, however, sell on tight progressive stops.

You will ﬁnd that, in many cases, the heavy volume signal will develop
(sometimes with also a One-Day Reversal or an Exhaustion Gap) on or near
the  Red  Parallel. You  will  watch  especially  for  this  volume  indication  as  a
sign of a good proﬁt-taking point. If the volume signal does not show up,
your selling objective is this Red Parallel, at a limit or on tight progressive
stops. In case there is no such volume signal at the top of the move and the
move  does  not  reach  the  Blue  Trend  nor  make  a  new  high,  you  are  very
likely running into a Triangle situation. In that case, you will have to wait
for a breakout one way or the other. Meanwhile, maintain your stop protec-
tion underneath.

recent move.

Covering Short Sales

Immediately  on  execution  of  the  short  sale,  determine  the  stop  level  (see
Chapter 27 on Stop Orders), and place your protective stop. Penetration of
this stop level will automatically close out your transaction. The stop level
may be moved down according to the “three days away” rule, but may never
be moved up.

If  the  stock  closes  above  a  previous  Minor  Top  (thus  setting  up  an

ascending Blue Trend), buy to cover on tight progressive stops.

If the stock declines on moderate volume and then develops unusually
high volume on any day during the decline before either the Red Trend is
broken  (with  a  close  below  that  trendline),  or  before  the  stock  has  made  a
new low closing under the last Minor Bottom, close out the transaction on
tight progressive stops.

If the stock develops high volume on the day on which it either breaks
and  closes  below  the  Red  Trend  or  makes  a  new  low  closing  under  the
previous Minor Bottom, hold it short. If heavy volume again occurs on the
following day or any subsequent day, however, buy to cover on tight pro-
gressive stops.

You will ﬁnd that in many cases the heavy volume signal will develop
(sometimes with also a One-Day Reversal or an Exhaustion Gap) on or near
the Blue Parallel. You will watch especially for this volume indication as a

sign of a good proﬁt-taking point. If the volume signal does not show up,
your buying objective is the Blue Parallel, at a limit or on tight progressive
stops. In case there is no such volume signal at the bottom of the move and
the move does not reach the Red Trend nor make a new low, you are very
likely running into a Triangle situation. In that case, you will have to wait
for  a  breakout  one  way  or  the  other,  meanwhile  maintaining  your  stop
protection overhead.

Additional Suggestions

When  a  level  is  reached  which  appears  to  be  either  a  Minor  Bottom  on  a
reaction or a Minor Top on a rally, and when the stock continues to stall and
remain  at  this  point,  moving  in  a  very  narrow  range  for  3 weeks  or  more
without giving any signal either by way of price change or volume action
as to its next move, it is wise to assume that this congestion is deﬁnitely a
key area, should be considered a Minor Top or Bottom, and protective stops
adjusted to it as a Basing Point, instead of the previously established Top or
Bottom,  as  against  the  possibility  that  the  move  out  of  this  area,  when  it
comes, 

 be in the wrong direction.

may

After  a  series  of  moves  in  a  trend,  with  each  move  in  the  Primary
Direction marked by heavier volume than the retreats or Corrective Moves
against  the  trend,  you  are  likely  to  have  a  move  in  the  Primary  Direction,
  volume;  that  is  to  say,  by  much  larger
which  is  marked  by 
volume than the normal increase for a Primary Move. On such a move, after
taking your proﬁts on previous commitments, you would ordinarily begin
to plan the next commitment on the Correction. But in this particular case,
noting  the  extreme  volume,  you  would  cancel  any  immediate  plans  for
further commitments in the Primary Direction.

extraordinary

climactic

The reason for this is that such 

 volume normally indicates the
ﬁnal “blow-off” of the Intermediate Trend, to be followed either by a Rever-
sal,  or  at  least  by  a  period  of  stagnation,  or  formation  of  Consolidation
Patterns,  or  Intermediate  Correction.  In  such  a  case,  it  is  not  safe  to  make
any further commitments on this trend pending further developments and
the positive reassertion of the trend.

If you examine daily charts of various stocks, covering long and impor-
tant  trends,  you  will  ﬁnd  that  the  series  of  Minor  Moves  making  up  the
Intermediate Trend is likely to culminate in a Minor Move marked by tre-
mendous volume. This is more true of Tops than Bottoms, although at the
end of the Panic Phase of a Bear Market, we very often see climactic volume.
The climax indicates, on the other hand, the sale of large amounts of stock
by  strong  investors  to  weak  traders,  near  the  top;  on  the  other  hand,  the
liquidation  of  holdings  by  weak  traders  occurs  near  the  bottom,  into  the
hands of strong investors who will hold them for the next Major Move.

One of the most common errors, and one of the easiest to fall into, is to
mistake a Climactic Top or Bottom for a normal conﬁrmation or preparatory
signal for a new commitment in line with the preceding trend.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

It is similar in nature to the error often made by novices in the market
of buying on the Minor Tops (becoming dazzled with the rapid price advance
and the great volume of activity). However, in the case of these ﬁnal “blow-
off” moves, the volume is greater and the adverse portent far more serious.

General Outline of Policy for Trading in the Major Trend

B.

A. Always  trade  in  the  direction  of  the  Major  or  Primary  Dow  Trend
(EN: See the editor’s comments in Chapter 3)
 as it is indicated at the time.
If the two component Averages of the Dow Theory (Industrials and
Rails 
) are not in agreement, trade in the direction
of  the  last  established  Primary  Trend  but  only  in  the  component
which is still following that trend. 

EN9: Transportations

C. Examine charts of group Averages covering groups of businesses in
the  same  or  related  lines;  trade  in  the  Primary  Direction  when  the
trend of the group corresponds.

D. Trade in any particular stock when its own individual chart indicates
a  trend  in  the  same  direction  as  the  Primary  Trend,  and  when  the
technical picture has indicated a probable move in that direction.

Make  all  new  commitments  on  the  reactions  or  rallies  following  the
signaling move in the Primary direction, except in the case of Primary Rever-
sals from Bull Market to Bear Market, when short sales may be made at the
market immediately following the Reversal.

Exception: after an extended move or a series of moves in the Primary
Direction,  when  signs  of  exhaustion  and  Reversal  appear  in  individual
charts, commitments in the opposite direction may be made with objectives
limited to a correction of the preceding Intermediate Move in the Primary
Direction.

great value to a Trader and are worth study. Technology rides to the rescue. A color

Use of Support and 
Resistance

We  know  that  after  many  breakouts  from  well-deﬁned  Reversal  and  Con-
solidation  Patterns,  we  get  a  short  countermove  back  to  the  edge  of  the
pattern,  and  that  the  checking  of  this  move  at  that  point  is  an  example  of
Support  or  Resistance,  as  the  case  may  be. Also,  we  should  be  familiar  by
now with the tendency of stocks to move up or down in a series of zigzag
steps. If the move is upward, the reaction after each advance tends to stop
at the level of the preceding peak. If the move is downward, the rally after
each decline tends to stop at the level of the preceding bottom. This is again
a  matter  of  Support  and  Resistance,  and  provides  the  basis  for  buying  on
reactions or selling on rallies.

It  has  also  been  pointed  out  that  Intermediate  Secondary  Moves  will

frequently stop at or close to the previous Intermediate Top or Bottom.

It is necessary to evaluate the importance of these phenomena of Support
and Resistance, and apply them in market practice, for they are among the
most  important  tools  we  have.  Unfortunately  it  is  not  easy  to  reduce  this

be made. See endnote of this chapter for an interesting effort to do just that.)
 Here
you will depend very largely on experience and observation. You will have
to be alert in spotting the levels where Resistance or Support is likely to be
encountered, and some judgment is needed in balancing the various factors
that will affect the situation.

For example, there is a stock which has broken up out of a well-deﬁned
Rectangle of considerable duration. Should the heavy volume of the breakout
move give way to a dull reaction, you will look for an opportunity to buy
this  stock  at  a  point  a  little  above  the  top  level  of  the  Rectangle.  It  will
probably not penetrate very far below that level and, indeed, will often fail
to  react  all  the  way  to  the  Support.  If  the  stock  should  then  advance  to  a
new high, and once more decline on low volume, you may look for another
buying point at about the level of the peak reached on the original breakout.
Another advance may be followed by reaction to the second peak, and this
process may be repeated a number of times, each reaction carrying back to
the level of the preceding high.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Now we all know that this sort of thing does not continue indeﬁnitely.
When  the  stock  ﬁrst  breaks  out,  moving  from,  say,  15  to  19,  we  may  buy
rather  conﬁdently  on  the  reaction  to  17,  if  that  is  the  Support  Level.  If  we
did not buy on this move, we may buy with considerable assurance on the
reaction to Support after the next advance. This advance might have carried
the  price  to  21  and  our  buying  point  would,  of  course,  be  at  the  previous
peak  of  19.  However,  as  the  stock  moves  up  to  25,  30,  40,  it  must  be  clear
that we are approaching a real Top; that although we cannot say where that
Top will be reached, we can be sure that it is becoming increasingly tempting
to long-time holders of this stock to sell and take their substantial gains. The
series of steps is bound to come to an end. To be sure, the Major course of
the stock and of the market may continue up for months or years, but after
a  series  of  sharp  rises,  we  may  reasonably  expect  a  Reversal  and  a  rather
substantial Intermediate Decline before the upward move is continued.

Therefore, we must regard each successive step of advance with increas-
ing  suspicion,  and  it  is  a  fair  rule  that  after  a  stock  has  made  three  such
moves in the Primary Direction, it is time to look for an Intermediate Cor-
rection, or at least an important period of Consolidation.

Thus, we have the rough shape of a rule. Buy on the reaction to Support
after the ﬁrst breakout. Buy on the reaction to the ﬁrst Minor Peak after the
next move. But do not buy on the reaction to the second Minor Peak.

Let us say, then, that we have been successful in two short-term moves,
buying on the reaction to Support and selling on the climax after a new Top
has been made. But we have decided not to attempt a third such trade. What,
then, may we expect next? We may see a period of Consolidation, we may
see  the  beginning  of  an  Intermediate  Decline,  or  we  may  see  the  stock
actually go right on moving up. No matter. We will wait for the Intermediate
Reaction. We will wait until the stock makes a very substantial decline, and
this may take many weeks. Then, if the Major Trend has not reversed itself,
we  will  again  look  for  a  buying  opportunity  at  (or  somewhat  above)  the
Intermediate  Support,  which  will  usually  be  the  top  level  of  the  advance
preceding the one just completed, for this is the level from which the next
Primary Advance is likely to proceed and is a good buying point.

Of  course,  we  ﬁnd  the  same  situation  in  Bear  Markets.  A  breakout  is
likely  to  be  followed  by  one,  two,  three,  or  more  steps  of  decline,  with
intervening rallies to Minor Resistance. Sooner or later (and we would count
on  no  more  than  three  such  steps  in  a  series),  we  will  get  a  turn  and  an
Intermediate Recovery. We will then wait for this rally, which may itself be
made up of several Minor steps, to reach or approach closely the preceding
Intermediate Bottom, at which point we may look for substantial Resistance.
Here is the place again to put out shorts.

Questions  will  come  to  your  mind.  One  of  them,  and  one  of  the  most
important  is:  how  do  we  decide  when  an  expected  Support  or  Resistance
has failed us, and at what point do we then abandon our position?

It will be clear that this question can be a very painful one. Let us suppose

on the basis of expected Support at 23, the level of a previous Minor Peak.
The  order  is  executed  during  a  dull  reaction.  The  next  day,  the  stock  slips
, on perhaps only two or three sales. The next day, it continues
down to 22
, still on low volume. And during the next week, it goes down
down to 21
steadily, without much volume, nearly every sale being at a lower price, as
though  no  new  bids  were  being  received,  and  as  though  no  substantial
number  of  bids  were  standing  on  the  book  at  any  point. A  decline  of  this
sort can eventually assume the magnitude of an Intermediate Reaction. The
move  may  carry  down  to  15  before  it  turns.  Obviously  this  was  not  what
you expected, and you should be out of the stock.

The painful part of these drifting moves is that you do not want to sell
your  stock  (which  you  bought  at  23
)  on  just  a  slight  move  down,  say  to
22
, since the probability is strong that it will shoot up at any moment to
new  high  levels.  And  yet,  at  some  point  during  a  continued  decline,  you
must decide, “This has gone through the Support; I should sell and take a
small loss now, rather than risk a more serious loss.” And the most painful
part of all is that sometimes, the moment you have sold and taken your loss,
the stock will come to life and complete what would have been an extremely
proﬁtable move.

You might just as well prepare yourself for this sort of disappointment;
for it will happen to you. But to avoid nights of pacing the ﬂoor and days
of worry, you should decide, 
 just
how much leeway you are prepared to give the stock. Then you will not be
tempted  to  put  off  a  decision  from  day  to  day  if  things  are  not  going  the
way you hoped.

at the time you make the original commitment,

In  the  case  of  purchases  or  short  sales  made  against  Minor  Peaks  or
Bottoms, as the case may be, you might set up the following rule. Measuring
from  the  extreme  high  of  the  previous  (Supporting)  Minor  Top,  or  the
extreme low of the previous (resisting) Minor Bottom, set a stop using the
(EN9:  See  also  Chapter  28.  And
method  we  have  outlined  in  Chapter 27. 
consider the risk limitation procedures in Chapter 42.) 
This would often be the
intraday  high  or  low,  not  necessarily  the  closing  price.  Penetration  to  that
extent should be presumptive evidence that your expected Support or Resis-
tance is not going to function.

Where you are buying against Major or Intermediate Support, or selling
short against Major or Intermediate Resistance, you can allow a little more
leeway  for  penetration.  In  such  cases,  examine  the  Support  or  Resistance
Area, and estimate visually its core or axis; in other words, try to gauge the
“center  of  gravity”  of  this  area,  the  point  which  is  most  nearly  the  mean
price  of  sales  occurring  there,  taking  into  account  the  volume,  since  the
important thing is to determine the approximate price level at which a great
many  shares  changed  hands.  Having  determined  this  point,  set  your  stop
beyond it, according to the methods speciﬁed in Chapter 27.

Up to this point we have concerned ourselves (reversing the usual order)

about where, precisely, to get in, nor where, precisely, to take proﬁts.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

In  the  matter  of  getting  in,  i.e.,  making  the  original  commitment,  you
will  feel,  perhaps,  that  there  is  a  conﬂict  between  acting  on  Support  or
Resistance, and acting on either trendline action or a computed reaction of
40% to 50% after a previous move. At times there is such conﬂict, and it is
not possible to state any exact rule which will reconcile these three different
trading  indications.  However,  in  a  great  number  of  cases,  you  will  be
delighted  to  observe  that  a  reaction  of  about  45%  will  bring  your  stock  to
the trendline, and will also bring it near to the Support or Resistance Level.
After a move to a new Minor Top, a stock may be expected to react: (1) about
40% to 50% of that move, (2) to the Basic Trendline, and (3) to the previous
supporting Minor Top. Your purchase, then, will be based on a consider-
ation  of  all  three  factors.  If  you  have  bought  “early,”  on  the  basis  of  one
factor alone, you may expect the stock to react a bit further without spoiling
the triple indications to the extent of catching your stop. It would be best
to  make  your  purchases  on  the  basis  of  whichever  factor  indicates  the
smallest  reaction,  and  to  place  your  stop  beyond  the  greatest  reaction
indicated  by  any  of  the  three.  Ordinarily,  there  will  not  be  too  much
difference  between  these  three  points.  As  usual,  the  method  applies  in
reverse to short sales.

Where you are buying after an Intermediate Decline, or selling after an
Intermediate  Rally,  you  will  lean  somewhat  more  heavily  on  Support  and
Resistance  than  on  either  a  computed  percentage  for  the  Secondary  Move
or a trendline. You will, of course, examine the history of the stock, preferably
on weekly or monthly charts ﬁrst, to see its Major Trend, to locate important
Support or Resistance Areas, and to estimate roughly the extent of the Cor-
rective  Move,  the  termination  of  which  you  are  trying  to  gauge.  You  will
then  check  these  data  in  the  more  detailed  picture  you  can  get  from  your
daily charts. As the Intermediate Corrective Move approaches within 4% or
5% of the Support or Resistance Level, you may come to a day of extremely
heavy  volume;  and  this  day  may  also  be  a  One-Day  Reversal.  If  so,  your
commitment should be made at once, protected, of course, by a stop. Oth-
erwise,  you  may  make  your  commitment  whenever  the  chart  begins  to
hesitate  or  ﬂatten  out,  or,  lacking  other  indications,  when  it  has  come  to
within 3% of the Support or Resistance.

Now in this case, your problem in taking proﬁts is a bit more difﬁcult
than in the case of Minor Moves. You are expecting a Reversal of the Inter-
mediate Corrective Move and the establishment of a new Intermediate Trend
in the Primary Direction. You are at a point where the course of the market
is uncertain. You must realize that prices may stay at the Support (or Resis-
tance)  Level,  forming  a  Line  or  Rectangle,  and  ﬁnally  penetrate  that  level,
establishing Reversal of the Major Trend. Or they may be stopped and turned
at  the  Support  or  Resistance  Level,  only  to  make  a  small  move  away  and
then return for another, and possibly successful, attempt at penetration. Or
(and  this  is  what  you  hope,  of  course)  a  continuation  of  the  Major  Trend
may  develop,  with  a  sharp  move  on  increased  volume  in  the  favorable
direction, to be followed, perhaps, by a Minor Corrective Move and another

thrust in the Primary direction; perhaps a new series of Minor Moves car-
rying the entire Primary Trend into new ground.

Taking  these  cases  one  by  one,  if  the  stock  remains  at  the  Support  or
Resistance Level for many days or several weeks, and then penetrates that
level, closing at a price that is clearly through it, get out at once. If the stock
makes  a  small  move  in  the  right  direction  and  returns  to  the  Support  or
Resistance, prepare to get out if there is a deﬁnite penetration. If, however,
the move is in the right direction, watch for volume indications, and prepare
to set tight stops to take your proﬁts as soon as heavy volume appears (except
on a day of breakout). Of course, once such a signal has appeared, you are
then  justiﬁed  in  continuing  to  make  new  commitments  on  the  following
Minor Correction, and the one following that, for you are again moving in
the Major Trend.

There is one other situation that should be mentioned here. Up to this
point,  we  have  assumed  that  all  of  your  commitments  have  been  made  to
take advantage of a move in the direction of the Major Trend. Let us suppose,
however, that a move which has carried a stock up to new high levels in a
series  of  Minor  steps  proceeds  to  form  and  then  breaks  out  of  a  Reversal
Pattern.  We  must  now  look  for  a  Secondary  Move  of  Intermediate  extent.
We  may  sell  short  on  the  rally  to  the  Minor  Resistance,  and,  if  the  move
continues down, we may make a second and even (more cautiously) a third
commitment against successive Minor Bottoms. But, in this case, we will be
looking for the decline to end somewhere in the vicinity of the last previous
Intermediate  Top,  which  is  now  a  Support  Level.  Similarly,  following  a
recognized Reversal Pattern and upward breakout on volume during a Bear
Market, we may expect an Intermediate Rally which can be used for trading
up to the previous Intermediate Bottom where strong Resistance is likely to
show up. A skillful trader can turn these Secondary Moves into proﬁts during
periods when it is not possible to trade along the indicated Primary Trend;
but it should be remembered that, ordinarily, such moves cannot be expected
to go as far as will those in the Primary Direction.

We might close this chapter by reminding you again that, while Support
and  Resistance  action  in  the  Minor  Trend  is  shown  clearly  in  daily  charts,
the Intermediate and Major Supports and Resistances are most easily recog-
nized on weekly or monthly charts.

EN9: It seems to this editor that Magee’s discussion here of the use of Support
and Resistance is really most pertinent to position building and pyramiding. Alter-
natively the method applies to an issue which has just caught the analyst’s attention,
and he has missed the breakout, which is usually obvious (at least in hindsight). I
feel strongly that the serious trader should not miss the original breakout. Chasing
moving trains is never a helathy activity. Does this appear an impossible occupation,
watch  thousands  of  stocks?  Impossible  for  your  average  analyst,  but  not  for  your
average computer. For example the computer may be programmed to alert you when
a stock is gapping on volume or trading at volumes which are suspiciously large.
And given the plethora of services and user groups the trader stands a good chance
of spotting an issue to put on his watch list before it takes off.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Investors  should,  in  theory,  never  miss  a  breakout,  because  they  should  be
watching a much more limited group of issues. In my opinion these are primarily
indices and ishares. Of course an investor’s portfolio might include a few well chosen
individual  issues,  but  these  would  be  of  obvious  visibility  to  the  individual,  e.g.,
biotechs for an investor with some knowledge of the area, or Internets for an engineer,
etc.

The  unending  effort  to  remove  ambiguity  from  market  interpretation  extends
to identifying areas of support and resistance. Metastock (metastock.com), an excel-
lent  software  package,  has  a  number  of  value  added  packages.  One  of  the  more
interesting of these, Powerstrike™ by John Slauson of Adaptick, Inc. (adaptick.com)
attempts to mathematically deﬁne support and resistance zones. Slauson’s package
is interesting, and the reasoning and observation behind it are interesting. Market
analysis  is  rooted  in  one  thing:  the  intelligent  observation  of  the  operation  of  the
market. Dow watched the markets for years and came to the understanding of waves
which led to Dow Theory. Schabacker and Edwards, equipped with these observations
and comments, collated and observed more data and recognized the persistent pat-
terns which occurred over and over in the markets, and added Magee for his practical
engineer’s approach to solving the tactical and strategic questions. In the 1980s one
of my friends, a Chicago market maker in the options pit, noticed that there was a
90 second delay on data coming out of the futures pits to the options pit. He set up
a “human ticker” with a direct phone connection to his pit and enjoyed a 90 second
advantage over other market makers until the glitch was noticed and corrected.

Slauson (among others) noticed that important trading and support and resis-
tance  in  optionable  stocks  tended  to  cluster  around  important  option  strike  price
levels. In fact these levels inﬂuence stock prices and may be said to determine where
“important” buying and selling occur. Obviously support and resistance levels are
set by concentrated face offs between buyers and sellers. A battleground metaphor
is appropriate: Since the time of the Greeks battles have occurred time and again in
the same physical locations. The reason is obvious. You need physical space to deploy
an army. So commanders will be attracted to the plain or open ground for face offs,
and to the high ground for defensive purposes. Option strike prices have the same
attractiveness for traders that a good battleground has for a military commander. A
good place to test the enemy.

Powerstrike™  analyzes  the  instrument  price  and  volume  around  the  nearby
option  strike  prices  and  determines  whether  support  or  resistance  is  stronger.  All
in all a clever application of number-driven analysis to the support and resistance
question. The chart analyst may supplement his analysis with a routine like this.

Not All in One Basket

EN: As diversiﬁcation for the small investor is nowadays inﬁnitely easier, an inter-
esting endnote follows Magee’s text.

Diversiﬁcation  is  important  because  technical  patterns  do  not  always
carry out their original promise. If all your capital is tied up in one stock, or
in a few stocks of the same group or line of business, you may be hurt by a
false move affecting only your holdings, even though the rest of the market
may continue to hold ﬁrm or even to move farther along the Primary Trend.
By diversifying, you are protected by the law of averages against all of your
holdings going the wrong way, except of course, in the case of some Reversal
that affects the entire market or a large segment of it.

Intelligent diversiﬁcation calls for study of the costs of buying and selling
stocks, especially in small quantities. You might wish to have a portfolio of
stocks  representing  the  entire  Dow–Jones  Averages,  or  a  selection  that
includes at least one stock of every major group. But if your capital is limited,
this  might  mean  buying  only  a  half-dozen  shares  of  each  stock,  and  the
minimum  commission  charges  would  make  this  an  expensive  operation,
entirely too costly for short-term trading. The short-term trader must always
think of these costs. They are more important to him than to the long-term
investor who may intend to hold the same stock for many months or years.
To you as a trader, a quarter point or a half point may mount up to serious
proportions when it is multiplied through a number of transactions.

Your broker can give you a schedule showing commission and tax costs,
and in case there are any important changes in the rates, you should study
them to see what effect they will have on your costs of trading in stocks at

various  prices. 
checking websites of scottrade.com, etrade.com and tdameritrade.com. google.com is
as ever an important price checking resource, and Barron’s publishes a yearly edition
evaluating  brokerage  houses.  In  general  this  editor  believes  that  the  investor  who
does  it  the  “old-fashioned  way,”  i.e.,  by  phone  and  human  broker  operates  at  a
disadvantage unless the broker’s value added can be quantiﬁed and proven.

You will ﬁnd that your round-trip costs are a higher percentage of the
capital invested in low-priced stocks than in high-priced stocks. Also, that
the percentage costs will be higher on a smaller number of shares than on
a round lot, and increasing as the number of shares decreases. Also, that the
percentage costs rise as the total amount of capital used is less.

If your capital is, say $1000 or $2000, you might do well to divide it into
units of about $500 each and conﬁne your trading to odd lots of stocks selling

at 40 or higher. With larger capital, you could use larger trading units and
extend the range of trading into somewhat lower-priced stock. In any case,
it is important to diversify your holdings. By dividing your capital and using
it  in  such  a  way  as  to  avoid  unnecessary  penalties  in  high  costs,  you  will
have greater protection against freak moves and sudden changes that might
affect a single stock very seriously.

On  the  other  hand,  if  you  have  sufﬁcient  capital  to  secure  plenty  of
diversiﬁcation  (8  or  10  stocks  should  be  a  maximum  for  an  active  trading
account), you can increase the size of the trading units. The whole question
here is as to the minimum amounts to be invested in a single commitment,
and if these amounts were doubled or tripled, it would not increase costs,
but would, in many cases, reduce them.

EN: Diversiﬁcation and Costs 

In this original chapter, Magee discussed the necessity for considering costs while
striving for diversiﬁcation. In present-day markets, diversiﬁcation may be achieved
through the use of SPDRs and DIAMONDS and similar instruments at compara-
tively reasonable costs. Index funds and mutual funds also represent diversiﬁcation
and cost control for the general investor. Mutual funds will not control costs and
expenses as efﬁciently as the Index Shares. This is because mutual funds create costs
that the Index Shares do not: management fees and expenses, slippage, the spread,
turnover,  and  taxes  resulting  from  realized  gains.  These  costs  may  be  avoided  by
the careful independent investor.

his

An internationally prominent trader has told me, on more than one occasion,
that his respectable trading fortune amounts to what brokers and specialists would
have made off him if he had been a member of the general public. The most important
weapon in 

 quiver was seats in Chicago, New York, and San Francisco.
The message is extremely clear. The general investor must control his costs. The
more  frequently  he  trades  the  greater  his  chances  of  having  his  capital  ground  to
hamburger meat by brokers, specialists, ﬂoor traders, market makers, tax authorities,
Exchanges, etc. Etcetera, because there is undoubtedly another party out there taking
a chunk as the capital changes hands. The phone company maybe.

Trading costs are the last item brokerage ﬁrms want to focus on (see the book

controlled commission costs, but entering the Internet Age a different ethos rules —
Cutthroat (and cutfees) competition, reluctantly brought to the old-line exchanges
by upstart competitors, and not suppressed by the SEC and CFTC.

It would be misleading to attempt to analyze costs in this book because of the

mercurial nature of cost ﬁgures as ﬁrms compete in the Internet Age.

 The SEC, runs a mutual fund calculator for computing costs of mutual funds.
Mutual funds are among those that manage somehow to not be overly punctilious
in estimating (read, disclosing) their costs to investors. (See Resources, Appendix
D.) morningstar.com is also a good resource for researching mutual funds.

But let me emphasize once again that ishares and etfs have really made mutual

funds obsolete if the investor uses the simple procedures outlined in this book.

Measuring Implications 
in Technical Chart Patterns

If you show one of your charts to a friend and tell him it looks Bullish, he
will reply immediately, “How far do you think it will go?” This is an auto-
matic response; you can count on it.

That

The question is a good one. How far is this expected move likely to go?
You don’t know. Nobody knows. Very often you can say, with a fair degree
of assurance, “This stock, which has just made such-and-such an advance,
  you  can  estimate
is  likely  to  react  to  around  such-and-such  a  price.” 
fairly  closely  seven  or  eight  times  out  of  ten,  by  referring  to  the  Basic
Trendline, the parallel projection of the top trendline, or the Support Level.
These rules work out fairly well as applied to reactions in the Bull Trend,
and similarly, we can estimate rallies in a Bear Trend. Not so with the move
in  the  direction  of  the  trend  itself.  A  Bullish  Move  may,  and  often  does,
overrun the upper trendline by running up as far again as the move to the
trendline. A Bearish Move may exceed the downtrend, dropping apparently
without  limit.  (That  is  one  reason  we  have  protective  stops  —  to  prevent
disaster in case the trend suddenly reverses itself.) And that is why we prefer
the use of nearby progressive stops as a method of taking proﬁts, rather than
using limit orders placed at a trendline, Resistance Level, or at some other
deﬁnite point. Very often, to be sure, a stock 
 check its advance at one of
these indicated points, but the cases where a move carries beyond its objec-
tives are fairly common, and in such cases, no one can make even a reason-
able guess as to what limit the stock will reach on the move.

will

This  follows  because  the  move  itself  is  an  unreasonable  one.  It  is  an
example of public participation, the surge of uncontrolled speculation (and
very often, it is the ﬁnal surge of that particular trend).

In  exactly  the  same  way,  and  often  more  violently,  the  uncontrolled
falling out of trend in a downward move is an example of Panic, and being
completely beyond reason, it follows no rule and knows no predetermined
limits.

There are, however, certain patterns and certain situations where we can
make some estimate of the probable extent of a move in the Primary Direc-
tion — usually an estimate of its minimum extent. In these cases, we have
a guide to help us in making the decision as to whether the situation offers

enough  potential  gain  to  be  worth  the  risks  involved.  Also,  the  indicated
measurement  gives  us 
  a  hint  of  about  where  we  might  reasonably
begin to look for the volume which will indicate the Top.

at  least

at least

For example, a decisive breakout from a Symmetrical Triangle is likely
to carry 
 as far as the height of the Triangle measured along its ﬁrst
reaction. This is a conservative measurement. The move may go much far-
ther. In fact, the trend implications of the Triangle would suggest a contin-
uation  equal  to  the  move  preceding  the  Triangle  and  leading  into  it,  for  if
the trend continues valid, the move should run up to the upper limit of the
channel. In the case of a Reversal, we would also use the height of the ﬁrst
reaction  as  a  minimum  measure.  With  Right-Angle  Triangles,  we  also  can
take the long side (formed by the ﬁrst reaction) as a rough measure of the
minimum expected move.

And  with  Rectangles,  the  minimum  we  may  reasonably  expect  after  a
breakout is a distance equal to the height of the Rectangle. The Head-and-
Shoulders Pattern carries a good measuring stick. The height of the formation
from the extreme Top of the head down to the point directly beneath where
the neckline crosses represents the minimum probable move from the neck-
line down. Again, this is a matter of Trend Channels, and most emphatically
this  is  only  a  minimum  move.  Some  Head-and-Shoulders  Patterns,  repre-
senting an implied move of no more than three or four points, have marked
the start of a decline eventually running to hundreds of points.

The rather unusual breakout which takes the form of an almost vertical
“mast”  running  up  (or  down)  many  points  before  arriving  at  a  stopping
point,  where  some  Consolidation  Pattern  is  made,  carries  with  it  a  most
explicit  measuring  rule,  and  one  which  works  out  with  amazing  accuracy.
The Flag or Pennant Consolidation will occur at the halfway point — “the
Flag  ﬂies  at  half  mast.”  The  speculation  move  leading  up  to  the  Flag  very
likely  will  be  duplicated  by  another  rise,  at  least  equal  to  the  ﬁrst,  in  the
near  future.  Following  this  rise,  there  may  be  another  Consolidation  and
other rises, or there may not. After two surges of this sort, it is best to stand
back and let someone else carry the ball. If you keep enough charts, and for
a  long  enough  time,  you  will  see  many  perfect  examples  of  this  beautiful
formation. You  will  also  see  some  imperfect  examples,  some  failures. And
because the move is so spectacularly proﬁtable when it works out, you will
be tempted to buy on every Consolidation Pattern formed after a sharp rise.
It would be best to wait until the example is clear — a nearly vertical, almost
unbelievable  rise,  followed  by  several  days  of  congestion  with  practically
no  volume.  If  the  congestion  continues  or  sags  off  for  more  than  about
3 weeks, sell the stock; it is probably not the real thing.

Needless to say, this same pattern appears in reverse in downtrends and

can be traded on accordingly.

The  questions  relating  to  the  measuring  attributes  of  gaps  have  been
reviewed  in  detail  in  Chapter 12.  The  only  type  of  gap  which  carries  sub-
stantial implications as to the extent of the move to follow is the Runaway
or  Continuation  Gap.  The  appearance  of  such  a  gap  during  a  rapid  price

move is likely to mark approximately the halfway point; and two or more
such  gaps  can  be  weighed,  in  connection  with  volume  and  total  extent  of
the move, to estimate the probable mid-point of the move, and thus to predict
a probable ultimate objective.

Measuring properties have been ascribed to other patterns and occasion-
ally  work  out  according  to  plan.  In  general,  however,  the  best  measuring
devices  are  your  trendlines,  Support-and-Resistance  Levels,  and  the  all-
important signals of increased volume.

ment  does  not  lead  the  trader  to  indulge  in  expectations  which  distract  him  from
 it might be quite all right. So as an
the 
off hand casual tool it might serve some use. Always better to observe closely what
the  situation  is  when  the  price  arrives  at  the  measured  point.  Decisions  should
always be made in the here and now, not in the I measured it then.

Tactical Review 
of Chart Action

The Dow Theory

The record shows that an investor who had bought a representative group
of  stocks  on  every  Major  Bull  Market  signal  according  to  the  Dow  Theory
as outlined in Chapters 3, 4, and 5, and had sold all his stocks on every Major
Bear Market signal, since the start of the Dow Averages, would have come

(EN9: Now
Although this tabulation does not take short sales into account, 
taken into account in the 9th Edition) 
it would be perfectly consistent to add
that  a  representative  group  of  stocks  might  be  sold  short  on  every  Major
Bear  Market  signal  and  covered  at  the  next  Bull  Market  signal. And  if  the
ﬁgures  for  such  short  sales,  based  on  the  level  of  the  Industrial  Average,
were included, the total proﬁts on these theoretical transactions, both long

and short, would be enormous. 
Theory, long only: $347,895.51. Dow Theory, long and short: $1,914,490.)

We  believe  that  this  record  carries  some  weighty  implications  which
have  a  bearing  on  the  operations  of  every  trader  and  investor.  We  will
comment on these shortly.

But before doing so, it should be pointed out that few, if any, investors
have  actually  followed  the  long-time  Dow  signals,  buying  or  selling  100%
on every Major signal.

In  the  ﬁrst  place,  to  do  so  would  require  a  long  market  lifetime,  and
would  presuppose  that  the  investor  had  accepted  the  Dow  Theory  in  its
  from  the  start,  and  that  he  had  never  wavered,  never
classic  form 
altered  the  deﬁnitions  nor  his  method  of  trading,  and  that  he  had  never
withdrawn any of his capital during the entire period.

in  toto

In  the  second  place,  we  would  have  to  assume  that  our  ideal  investor
had  an  extraordinary  degree  of  courage  in  order  to  stand  ﬁrm  in  periods
during  which  the  Major  Trend  appeared  to  be  making  dangerous  threats
against his position, and an extraordinary degree of patience in order to wait
out  the  many  months  of  stagnation  when  the  trend  seemed  to  be  getting
nowhere at all.

And in the third place, we would have to make the assumption that the
group of stocks actually bought or sold really represented a fair cross-section

July 15, served notice on holders of long commitments to sell at the market the next
day (at about 63) instead of waiting for the protective stop, which would have been

From this point, however, a weak rally on low volume started, and continued up
for 4 weeks. The weakness of this picture would justify a short sale on a rally of 40
to 50% of the move from the left shoulder to the bottom, or on a return to the neckline,
say,  at  63.  The  rally  actually  extended  to  the  neckline  at  64,  broke  away  on  a  gap
with volume, and continued down in a move that led, in the next 3 months, to prices
below 40, and later even lower.

An extraordinary feature of Head-and-Shoulders Tops is the frequency with which
a  comparatively  small  formation,  such  as  the  one  shown  here,  will  herald  a  Major
Move,  changing  the  course  of  the  stock  for  months  or  even  years  to  come.  Not  all
patterns of this type will lead to such big moves as this, but no Head-and-Shoulders
should be regarded lightly, ever.

Average  itself.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  if  the  group  were  well  diversiﬁed,  the
chances are good that its moves might approximate those of the Averages.
But it is taking a lot for granted to suppose that an investor could meet
all  these  conditions  over  a  period  of  years,  which  he  would  have  to  do  in

order  to  operate  strictly  as  a  “Dow  Theory”  trader.  It  is  not  seriously  sug-

spect, why not? Given, in the Internet Age, the availability of trading instruments
and markets, (DIA, SPY) it might not be such a bad idea. The implementation of
such a plan in Magee’s time would have been extremely cumbersome and expensive,
but it is eminently practicable in modern markets.

The  important  implications  of  which  we  spoke  are  these:  if  the  record
of  the  Averages  shows  that  on  these  Major  Signals  it  is  possible  to  take
substantial  theoretical  proﬁts  over  the  long  term,  and  if  the  Averages  are
composed  of  the  prices  of  individual  stocks,  then  the  probabilities  favor
buying  or  selling  a  majority  of  stocks  in  line  with  the  Major  Trend  of  the
Averages.  The  evidence  shows  that  Major  Trends  normally  continue  for
months or years. The line of “most probable gain,” therefore, is the line of
the Major Trend.

On this basis, we would be on safe ground to say that when a trend of
sufﬁcient importance gives a Major Signal that the Averages are under way,
there  will  be  a  greater  likelihood  of  ﬁnding  proﬁtable  situations  among
individual  stocks  moving  in  that  trend  than  among  those  moving  in  the
reverse trend.

It is suggested that you read this preceding paragraph again, carefully.
It means that we do not try to sell stocks “at the Top” in a Bull Market. We
do not try to “pick up bargains at the Bottom” in a Bear Market. We do not
deliberately buck the kind of trend that history shows is likely to continue
for an undetermined and possibly long time.

What  we  have  said  here  is  stated  with  a  little  different  emphasis  than
in previous editions of this book. You will notice we have not said that you
will never sell a stock short during a Major Bull Market, nor buy a stock in
a Bear Market. There will be, and often are, cases of stocks which are moving
against the Major Trend, and which, on the basis of their individual technical
behavior, may justify a commitment against the trend of the Averages.

But we feel such trades should be made cautiously and with a full realiza-
tion that the majority of stocks are moving in a contrary manner. Such trades
might be made, for example, in particular cases as indicated by the charts of
the stocks involved, as partial hedges to reduce overall risk. For example, if a
Bull Market had persisted for several years and was still presumably in effect,
but certain stocks had broken badly and showed individual weakness, a trader
might continue to hold three quarters of his capital in good long positions, but
might make a limited number of short sales in the weaker stocks. If, then, the
Bull  Market  continued,  he  might  eventually  have  to  close  out  the  shorts  for
losses, which could be regarded as the reasonable cost of “insurance.” On the
other  hand,  if  the  general  weakness  became  greater  and  eventually  reversed
the  Major  Trend,  then  the  short  sales  would  cushion  the  depreciation  of  the

which  the  present  Editor  has  developed  at  greater  length  in  the  theory  of  “natural
hedging.” And, given the complexity of modern markets proﬁts may be made on both
sides of the hedge, and this should be the objective.)

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

By using an Evaluative Index (see Chapter 38) instead of, or in addition
to, the Averages, it is possible to say, “The market appears to be about 60%
Bullish,” or “55% Bullish,” instead of merely Bullish or Bearish. This takes
account of the fact that some markets are more Bullish or more Bearish than
others; and it enables the investor to “roll with the punch” instead of having
(EN9:  I  have  called  this
to  take  an  all-out  position  one  way  or  the  other. 
“Rhythmic Trading.”)

It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  while  he  may  take  such  a  partial
position  against  the  (presumed)  Major  Trend,  he  will  continue  to  use  the
bulk of his capital in situations which accord with the main trend. He will
never risk the larger part of his assets in opposition to the trend, and he will
make  any  countermoves  with  a  clear  understanding  that  they  are  of  the
nature of insurance and serve this purpose even though they ultimately may
be closed out as small losses.

Summarizing all these implications of the Dow Theory: do not make a
majority of your commitments against the Major Trend. During periods of
potential  Reversal,  gradually  reduce  your  long  holdings,  and  make  short
sales to a limited amount in weak stocks; but do not attempt to anticipate
either  a  Major  Top  or  Major  Bottom  in  the Averages  by  making  an  all-out
commitment counter to the main trend. 

EN: Regarding speciﬁc formations, the following suggestions are made:

Head-and-Shoulders Top

A.

If you are long a stock, should a breakout down through the neckline
occur,  with  a  closing  at  least  3%  below  the  neckline,  next  morning
  point  below  the  last  close.  Continue  to  place  such
place  a  stop 
⅛
“tight  stops”  if  not  caught  the  ﬁrst  day, 
  point  under  each  day’s
close until one is caught.

⅛

B. Short  sales  may  be  made  after  a  breakout,  on  a  recovery  of  40%  of
the distance from the top of the right shoulder to the bottom of the
breakout  move,  or  on  a  recovery  to  a  line  drawn  down  across  the
top of the head and right shoulder, or on a Pullback to the neckline,
whichever  point  is  reached  ﬁrst.  If  the  breakout  move  continues
down another day, or for several days, the 40% recovery would be
based  on  the  entire  move  from  the  top  of  the  right  shoulder  to  the
lowest point reached.

Head-and-Shoulders Bottom

EN: The  editor,  long  distressed  by  the  paradox  of  the  term  “Head-and-Shoulders
Bottom,” proposes that this formation be renamed in technician’s nomenclature to
“the Kilroy Bottom.” See Figure 23.1.

Chapter thirty-three: Tactical Review of Chart Action

477

A.

If you are short a stock, should a breakout on increased volume occur,
penetrating the neckline and closing at least 3% above it, place a stop
 point higher than the close. If such a stop
next morning to cover at 
 point higher than
is not caught, continue each day to place a stop 
the previous day’s close until one is caught.

⅛

⅛

B. New purchases may be made after a breakout, on a reaction of 40%
of  the  distance  from  the  bottom  of  the  right  shoulder  to  the  top  of
the breakout move (which reaction must be on decreasing volume),
or on a reaction to a line drawn across the bottom of the head and
the right shoulder, or on a Throwback to the neckline, whichever is
reached ﬁrst. As in the case of the Top Formation, this 40% reaction
is  ﬁgured  on  the  entire  distance  of  the  breakout  move  if  it  should
continue up for several days.

Complex or Multiple Head-and-Shoulders

The  same  tactical  suggestions  apply  to  these  as  to  the  simple  Head-and-
Shoulders. Deﬁnitions and special features of these formations are covered
in Chapter 7.

Rounding Tops and Bottoms

It  is  difﬁcult  to  set  precise  rules  for  trading  on  these  gradual  changes  of
trend.  In  the  case  of  Rounding  Tops,  if  one  is  long  the  stock,  the  general
appearance  of  a  Rounding  Formation,  extending  over  a  period  of  several
weeks, leveling off from the rise and then turning down, very likely with a
tapering off of volume nearing the top of the rise and a pick-up of volume
as the turn starts down, would suggest getting out of the stock at the market
as soon as the picture looks more or less deﬁnite. A short sale of a Rounding
Top could be very proﬁtable; but no exact rule could be stated except that,
in the absence of ﬁxed Basing Points, one would want to be very certain that
the formation was unmistakably a Rounding Top. It would need to be well
formed and following a long rise, and extending over a period of some weeks
in  its  formation.  It  would  also  need  to  be  protected  with  a  stop  above  the
Top of the curve, as explained in the chapter on stops.

You would not be likely to be short a stock on a Rounding Bottom. The
long  and  gradual  rounding  appearance  with  dull  volume,  followed  by  a
sudden  revival  on  greatly  increased  volume,  would  be  signal  enough  to
cover if you should ﬁnd yourself in this uncomfortable position. Purchases
would  be  justiﬁed  in  a  stock  whose  chart  showed  a  Rounded  Bottom  or
Saucer,  after  the  ﬁrst  spasm  of  activity  following  a  long,  dull  period  of
dormancy.  You  would  buy,  according  to  the  rules  we  have  given  for  pur-
chases  on  reactions,  not  on  the  breakout,  but  on  the  reaction  following  it,
which would almost surely come.

Strictly speaking, a Continuation Head-and-Shoulders after a Secondary Correction
in the Bull Market. A Major Bottom, reversing a long Bear Market, would normally
take much longer to form.

Here we see heavy volume on the left shoulder, somewhat less on the head, and
very little on the right shoulder, with a sharp increase, as required, on the breakout
move of September 21. The breakout was followed by a Throwback to the neckline
on  diminishing  volume,  providing  a  good  opportunity  for  purchases  at  23.  The
upward move was resumed, and again there was a reaction to the neckline Support.
A second reaction of this sort is not unusual. The closing at 22
 on October 19, below
the previous Minor Bottom, and on increased volume, was mildly disturbing. But in
view of the strength of the pattern and breakout, we would not have sold the stock,
 was not even threatened. On October 25, the advance
and the protective stop at 21
was resumed with a Breakaway Gap and continued up to 29

The advance in “DG” from 4 to above 72 in just 3

 years, when seen on monthly
charts, is a smooth, accelerating curve which emerged from a long Bottom Formation
that had lasted 5 years from 1938 through 1942.

½

As we enter the ﬁnal 6 months leading up to the ultimate peak, note ﬁrst the action
during  January  and  February.  “DG”  had  just  completed  a  fast  run-up  in  the  last
quarter of 1945, and was about due for a Consolidation or a Secondary Correction.
On reaching 48, it turned back to 45, advanced to 50
, to 51, and ﬁnally to 52, and
then reacted to 44 at the end of February. Had the move on January 22 gone a little
lower and closed below the January 3 low, and then been followed by an even lower
closing on February 26, we would have had to consider this January–February pattern
a  completed  Broadening  Top,  a  deﬁnite  Reversal  signal.  However,  the  pattern  was
not  perfect,  and,  therefore,  not  valid,  but  the  erratic  price  action  shows  incipient
weakness.

½

It  is  not  unusual  in  these  last  stages,  when  public  participation  is  running  high,
for the climactic advances to be spectacular and fast. And that is what we see here.
A  5-point  Breakaway  Gap  occurred  on  March  25,  followed  by  an  advance  which
petered off at 63

, reacted, and then ran up to over 68.

½

From here on, the move advanced slowly, with suggestions of a Convergent Trend
and  a  succession  of  “heads”  and  “shoulders,”  and  volume  dropped  off  as  the  Top
was  reached.  The  drop  on  June  4  to  below  the  May  7  Minor  Bottom  on  increased
volume would complete the Rounding Top and call for immediate sale if we were
still long; and the penetration of the “neckline” on June 18 was a conclusive break.

Greyhound: a Rounding Bottom in 1945. A Continuation Pattern after

In July, volume ran fairly high on downside days, drying up as we entered August.

August 10 showed a spurt of volume on the upside, then more dullness.

The various small moves through August and September would not give us any
basis  for  trading  operations.  The  move  to  a  new  high  in  the  pattern  on August  31
suggested an upturn, and again on September 19–20, we see another little push up
to the 26 level. Still not conclusive, however.

The move which got under way in the week ending October 13 is more deﬁnite.
This decisive move with good volume carries right out of the “Bowl” in an almost
vertical ascent. Not a big move, but a clear indication of the probable trend. We would
look  for  a  point  to  buy  “G”  on  a  correction  of  40–50%  of  the  entire  move  up  from
the Bottom, or on a return to near the Support Level around 26. The purchase would
probably be made around 26

. Notice the drying up of volume on this reaction.

½

The  advance  from  here  to  30,  marking  an  entirely  new  Bull  Market  high,  came
almost immediately. On November 3, with very heavy volume for a Saturday, “G”
closed at 30, and since this volume was not on the day of breakout, we would have
closed out the transaction on a tight stop at 29
 on Monday (unless we had elected
to wait out the next Minor Reaction for a further advance).

⅞

Two  weeks  later,  on  the  basis  of  the  reaction  to  good  Support,  we  would  have
bought  “G”  again  at  about  29  (you  cannot  ﬁgure  on  getting  the  extreme  low  price
on any reaction). The following advance carried up to 34
 in 2 days. At that point,
proﬁts could have been taken or the stock held for the longer term. “G,” it might be
noted, continued up eventually to 54.

Symmetrical Triangles

A.

B.

If  you  already  have  a  position  in  the  stock.
  During  the  formation  of  a
Symmetrical  Triangle,  you  may  be  unable  to  make  any  change  in
your  holdings.  Let  us  say  you  have  bought  the  stock  on  a  reaction
after a Bullish Move. The next upsurge fails to make a new high and
gives no sufﬁcient volume signal to cause you to sell out. The next
reaction fails to carry below the previous one. You are “locked” into
the  Triangle,  and  you  cannot  safely  sell,  since  the  Triangle  that  has
formed may eventually break out in the original direction and show
you a good proﬁt (in fact, the odds favor that it will break out in that
direction). In case of a breakout move (which, of course, must be on
increased  volume  on  the  upside),  you  can  close  it  out  for  a  proﬁt
(according to rules for trading we have already given), and immedi-
ately mark it as a rebuy on the next reaction. If the breakout is down
(whether  or  not  on  increased  volume),  with  a  closing  outside  the
 point) stop the
Triangle, you should protect yourself with a tight (
next day, and continue to set such tight progressive stops under each
day’s close until it is sold.
If  you  are  short  the  stock,  the  same  rules  in  reverse  would  apply,
except that the breakout in the right direction (down) would require
no volume conﬁrmation, and the adverse breakout (up) would need
such increased volume.
If  you  do  not  have  a  position  in  the  stock
.  Stay  away  from  any  stocks
making  Symmetrical  Triangles  until  a  clear  and  deﬁnite  breakout
close has been made. After such a breakout, if on the upside, buy on
the next reaction if the Major Trend is up, or if on the downside, sell
short on the next rally if the Major Trend is down. Rules for making
such commitments have already been given.

⅛

Note:
 avoid breakouts from Symmetrical Triangles of the type which have
continued to narrow until the breakout point comes far out toward the apex.
The most reliable breakouts occur about two thirds along the Triangle.

Right-Angle Triangles

The  same  rules  would  apply  to  Right-Angle  Triangles  as  to  Symmetrical
Triangles (see Chapter 8 on Triangles). Early breakouts are more dependable
here, as in the case of Symmetrical Triangles. Volume conﬁrmation is more
important on upside breakouts from Ascending Triangles and is not strictly
required on downside breakouts from Descending Triangles. Commitments
already made are retained until the breakout and then closed out in the same
way as any transaction that shows a gain.

Triangle.  In  Point-and-Figure  charts,  this  type  of  pattern  is  known  as  a  Pendulum

decrease of volume.

on October 9 and 10.

No  question  about  the  validity  of  this  breakout.  Short  sales  were  in  order  on  a

 to 39. The rally carried to the apex of the Triangle, then broke away fast
for the decline to 33 where, on October 30, a Selling Climax and One-Day Reversal
occurred — a signal to take proﬁts.

Chapter thirty-three: Tactical Review of Chart Action

483

Since the Ascending and Descending Triangles carry a directional fore-
casting implication that the Symmetrical Triangles do not have, it is possible
to  make  new  commitments  on  reactions  within  an  Ascending  Triangle  or
rallies  within  a  Descending  one.  However,  since  the  ﬂat  horizontal  side  of
one  of  these  Triangles  represents  a  supply  or  demand  area  of  unknown
magnitude, and since, therefore, such a Triangle can be (and sometimes is)
turned  back  before  the  horizontal  line  has  been  decisively  penetrated,  it
might be better policy to note such formations in the making, and wait until
the decisive breakout before making the new commitment.

Broadening Tops

Presumably, you would not be long a Broadening Top. The early Reversals
in the pattern would have taken you out of the stock, if you follow the tactical
rules based on trendlines, as previously outlined, long before completion of
the pattern. Neither would you be tempted to buy into such a pattern, since
the trend indications would be clearly against a move.

On the other hand, a Broadening Top, after its completion, offers excel-
lent  opportunities  for  a  short  sale.  After  downside  penetration  and  close
below the fourth point of Reversal in the pattern, you are justiﬁed in selling
short on a rally of about 40% of the distance covered from the extreme top
(ﬁfth point of Reversal), and the lowest point reached on the breakout move.
The stop, of course, would be placed at the proper distance above the ﬁfth
Reversal, that is, the extreme top of the pattern.

Rectangles

A.

If  you  already  have  a  commitment  in  the  stock.
  The  early  moves  of  a
Rectangle may provide no volume signals to permit you to get out.
And there will, of course, be no “breakout” moves during the forma-
tion of a Rectangle that will allow you to take a proﬁt. However, as
soon  as  the  character  of  the  Rectangle  is  well  established  (and  that
will require at least four Reversals to set up a clear Top and Bottom),
you may trade on the Tops and Bottoms, that is, sell at or near the
Top; or buy at or near the bottom. Since, as in the case of Symmetrical
Triangles, there is a deﬁnite presumption in such formations that they
are more likely to lead to continuous moves than to Reversals, this
would mean that you would probably pass up your ﬁrst opportunity
to get out (on the ﬁfth Reversal), and would indeed probably decide
to  “ride  along”  in  the  expectation  of  a  continuation  of  the  original

An Ascending Triangle. “CMR,” after emerging from the doldrums
in  1943,  forged  up  to  about  12  early  in  1945.  The  ﬁrst  8  months  of  the  year  on  a
monthly  chart  showed  an  Ascending  Triangle  with  Top  at  12
.  On  daily  charts,
however,  we  see  the  more  detailed  aspects  of  this  large  pattern.  For  instance,  the
ﬁnal reaction of the whole (monthly) formation in August became here a Symmetrical
Triangle. The breakout from this pattern carried out the minimum measuring require-
 Top, from which point there was a reaction
ments, bringing the price again to the 12
which was stopped cold at 11, the apex of the Triangle. A purchase on the reaction
after  the  powerful  breakout  from  the  Triangle,  say  around  11
,  would  have  been
closed out on progressive stops, starting September 28 when “CMR” reached 14, the
⅞
sale being consummated October 2 at 14

, a highly proﬁtable move.

Proﬁt-taking  of  this  sort  would  largely  explain  the  stopping  of  the  rise  and  the
formation of a Consolidation Pattern which turned out to be the Ascending Triangle
with Top at 16
, lasting 8 weeks. Notice the November 7 volume when price went
  level,  but  failed  to  close  outside  the  pattern;  and  the  volume  on
through  the  16
November 30 when a clean, decisive breakout move closed at 17. This move ran to
20, and purchases would have been made at 18 or less on the reaction. The next wave
took “CMR” to its ultimate Bull Market Top at 24 in January. On the ratio scale, the
Top of the Ascending Triangle was exactly halfway between the September Bottom
at  11,  and  the  extreme  high  of  24.  This  type  of  halfway  consolidation  is  typical  of
Flags and Pennants, and this is a very similar case.

FIGURE  217.
A  Broadening  Top.  This  somewhat  rare  but  beautiful  and  highly
dependable formation developed as CertainTeed made its Bull Market Peak in 1946.
A quick glance at the volume scale in this daily chart shows the high volume on the
ﬁnal stages of the advance, the dullness during the development of the Top Pattern,
and the increased volume after the breakout.

As we all know by now (or go back to Chapter 10 and review the speciﬁcations),
a Broadening Top is a Five-Point Reversal, differing from the Head-and-Shoulders,
Triangles,  Rectangles,  etc.,  in  that  each  Reversal  must  be  at  a  new  high  or  low  for
the pattern. It is, if you wish, a sort of reversed Triangle with its apex to the left, the
swings becoming continually wider.

¼

In the second week of May, “CT” (the symbol has since been changed to “CRT”)
made  a  new  Bull  Market  high  at  25
  (marked  “1”).  The  reaction  carried  back  to
Support  at  the  previous  Minor  Peak  (point  “2”)  and  the  following  week,  “CT”
advanced to another new high at 3, closing 

 point above the previous Top.
½
Another week had brought “CT” down to point “4” with a closing at 22

, three
quarters of a point below point “2.” This, in itself, is not sufﬁcient reason for making
short  commitments.  Three  weeks  later,  “CT”  closed  at  25
,  another  new  high,  at
point  “5.”  Finally,  the  stock  dropped  to  21
  on  July  23,  and  at  this  point  (marked
“B”),  the  pattern  was  completed.  Notice  the  tendency  of  volume  to  rise  at  each
Reversal point of the pattern.

⅛

½

⅝

Long holdings would be sold at the market the day after the breakout. But short
sellers should wait for a correction of 40–50% of the move from point “5” to point
“B.”  If  shorts  were  put  out  at  23,  we  would  not  worry  if  the  stock  advanced  for  a
time, as it did, without making a new high. The downside move in “CT” went quickly
to 15

, and within 12 months to 11

FIGURE 218.
Rectangles in Remington Rand. This is part of a long Bull Market rise
that  carried  “RR”  from  under  10  to  above  50  in  the  period  from  1942  to  1946.  The
last  3  years  of  this  advance  were  almost  continuous,  as  seen  on  monthly  charts,
without any extensive reactions. When we put the chart on a daily basis, such as this
section covering the end of 1944 and the early months of 1945, right in the middle
of the advance, we see that the rise was not actually continuous but was built up of
steps in an ascending “staircase” of Accumulation Patterns. Each sharp advance on
increased volume is followed by a period of dullness and slight recession.

¾

A picture of this type suggests the methodical campaign of buyers who intended
to purchase large blocks of the stock for large long-term advances without creating
a “skyrocket” market by their own buying operations. Presumably each advance was
checked by the temporary distribution of part of the stock held by such buyers, and
reaccumulation started on reactions.

In October and November, there is a well-marked Rectangle between 20

 and 22.
A purchase could have been made at or near the bottom limit, say at 21, on the ﬁfth
Reversal on November 14. The move out of pattern in the week of December 2 did
not  carry  3%  out  of  pattern,  but  about  2  weeks  later  a  move  got  under  way  that
qualiﬁed as a valid breakout, with volume conﬁrmation as required on upside moves.
Notice  the  volume  increase  and  One-Day  Reversal  on  December  20  as  this  move
neared  its  Top.  Purchases  would  have  been  made  at  about  22
  on  the  basis  of  a
normal correction, and you would have expected Support at the 22 level. This Support
was  respected,  but  the  move  did  not  advance  beyond  23
,  made  this  same  Top  3
¼
times in a period of 2 weeks, and returned again to 22
.

¾

½

There was no question about the breakout on January 25. Extent and volume were
decisive. Notice the gap and One-Day Reversal on the following day as this Minor
Move reached its end.

In  mid-March,  as  you  will  see,  “RR”  plunged  down  from  its  high  of  27,  but  the
decline  was  stopped  in  its  tracks  at  the  top  level  of  the  January  Rectangle,  a  good
Support shelf. Never again during the Bull Market did “RR” even threaten this level,
since it moved up in April and continued its long march to the 1946 Top.

If  you  are  not  committed  in  the  stock.
  Trades  can  be  made  within  the
Rectangle  on  the  ﬁfth  and  subsequent  Reversals.  Since  there  is  the
slight probability that the move will eventually continue in the same
direction as the preceding move leading up or down to the Rectangle,
it might be best to wait until the sixth Reversal for new commitments,
which would set your interests in the same direction as a continua-
tion.  And,  of  course,  short  sales  can  be  made  after  any  downside
breakout close from a Rectangle, or purchases after an upside brea-
kout close with increased volume. Both the short sales and the long
purchases  would  be  made  on  the  Corrective  Move  following  the
breakout.

Double Tops and Bottoms

Double and Multiple Tops or Bottoms are not valid unless they conform to

be read carefully in this connection.

The  handling  of  these  on  breakouts  through  the  horizontal  side  would  be
similar  to  what  has  been  said  about  Multiple  Tops  and  Bottoms,  and
Right-Angle Triangles.

The Diamond

If you are sure that what you have is a valid Diamond Pattern, the rules for
trading  will  be  the  same  as  those  we  have  already  covered  in  connection
with breakouts from Symmetrical Triangles. As in the case of such Triangles,
new  commitments  should  wait  for  a  deﬁnite  breakout;  and  commitments
already in force would have to remain until such a breakout had occurred,
either  declaring  a  Reversal,  or  indicating  a  probable  continuation  of  the
original trend.

FIGURE  219.
A  Double  Bottom  in  Paramount  Pictures.  Double  Tops  and  Double
Bottoms are not as common as many traders like to think. They require considerable
time to develop and must conform to speciﬁcations as to price range and time, and
also  (on  upside  breakouts  from  Double  Bottoms)  as  to  volume.  They  are  easier  to
spot on weekly charts than on dailies.

This is a weekly chart of “PX” from September 1941 through March 1943. A Bottom
was made on climactic volume at 11
during the “Pearl Harbor Panic” Move. Then
⅝
came a rise lasting 8 weeks which brought “PX” back to 15
 — a rise, incidentally,
on  feeble  volume,  strongly  suggesting  the  possibility  of  another  crack-up  to  even
lower  levels.  This  rise,  you  will  notice,  was  a  considerable  one,  amounting  to  35%
of the price at the December low.

¾

The  downward  move,  however,  which  lasted  to  mid-April,  was  on  low  volume
and ended precisely at the December low of 11
 it is not necessary that moves
of this sort end at exactly the same level; the second Bottom could have been a bit
higher or lower without spoiling the pattern.)

order on reactions from this point on.

The move continued up for 3 years to an ultimate Top at 85.

FIGURE 220.
A Right-Angled Broadening Formation in Associated Dry Goods. A
beautiful  example  of  a  breakout  through  Multiple  Tops,  followed  by  an  important
move.  This  is,  however,  a  pattern  that  is  more  fun  to  observe  in  retrospect  than  to
follow as an active trader. The stock had moved up from an important Bottom around
4,  established  in  1938,  1940,  and  1942. At  the  time  of  this  chart  in  1945,  “DG”  was
starting the accelerating climb that eventually ended with the 1946 Rounding Top at
over 70. (See Figure 213.)

½

If you had been holding the stock, you would have been watching for a substantial
corrective move after the advance from 12 to 20. In late February and the ﬁrst week
of March, “DG” went into new Bull Market high-ground, reacted to Support around
19 to 19
, and then advanced again in the week of March 17, failing in this move to
make a new high. Ten days later, “DG” had reacted to 18
, closing below the previous
Minor  Bottom.  An  inexperienced  observer  might,  at  this  point,  have  commented
“Double  Top”  and  planned  to  sell  “DG”  at  once  or  even  to  make  a  short  sale.
However, the pattern was not large enough in duration nor extent of price movement
to qualify as a Double Top, nor did it conform to any other recognizable pattern of
Reversal. Nor was the volume as high as one would expect on an important Top.

The rally in early April carried through to a decisive breakout of more than 3% in
the move which reached 22
 on April 18. This move was a near penetration of the
middle Top, and conﬁrmed the uptrend. If you still held your long stock, you would
not  rest  easier,  and  in  any  case,  you  would  have  looked  for  a  chance  to  buy  on  a

FIGURE  221.
A  Diamond  Pattern  in  American  Can.  The  daily  chart  covers  the
period from 3 December 1946, through May 1947, inclusive. For background on this
situation, keep in mind that “AC” made its Bull Market Peak in October 1945 when
it reached 112. The tendency of high-grade, high-priced stocks to top-out early at the
end of a Bull Market has already been noted. The ﬁrst decline carried nearly to 90
and was followed by a rally to 106. The stock then dropped to below 80 and a second
rally brought us to the situation we see here.

You will notice at once that the moves have a gradual “rounding” appearance, due
to the fact that, at this price, conservative stocks do not make large percentage moves.
If  charted  on  a  scale  having  larger  vertical  intervals,  the  patterns  would  look  very
much like those in more speculative stocks.

The ﬁrst part of the pattern is similar to a Broadening Top. The ﬁrst Minor Peak
at 96 is followed by a reaction to 92. The second peak carries even higher, to 98; and
the reaction this time goes down to 91
. A third rally takes “AC” to 99. So far, we
¼
have the ﬁve Reversal points of a Broadening Top, needing only a close below 91
to  conﬁrm  the  Bearish  indications.  However,  the  next  decline  fails  to  break  out  of
 picture like a Symmetrical
the pattern, and for several weeks, we have a 
Triangle.

narrowing

¼

Eventually, the stock makes a clean breakout to 89, which is the signal to get out
of longs and to consider short sales on the next rally. As a matter of fact, the 3-week
rally which then started never made an upside penetration of the Resistance Level
at  94,  the  level  of  the  apex  of  the  converging  lines  bounding  the  latter  part  of  the
Diamond.

American Can did not make a spectacular move down from this point, which is
not surprising considering the markdown that had already taken place in “AC,” and
considering the habits and price of the stock, and the general condition of the market.
It did not, however, again rise to the level shown here, and, in fact, retreated to the
80 level.

To review the nature of the Diamond — it is not a common pattern. It is somewhat
like a Complex Head-and-Shoulders with a bent neckline. It resembles, at the start,
a Broadening Top, and its latter phase narrows like a Symmetrical Triangle.

Wedges

There is no need to set forth detailed rules for policy within a Wedge and
during  its  formation,  since  the  general  principles  taken  up  in  connection
with trendlines and Support and Resistance, would take you out of such a
situation at the ﬁrst opportunity after the convergent nature of the pattern
became clear. At the very worst, your stops (which we hope you maintain
faithfully in all situations) will take you out before the consequences become
serious.

Regarding new purchases (from a Falling Wedge breakout) or short sales
(from a Rising Wedge), the same volume characteristics would be expected:
notably increased volume on an upside breakout from a Falling Wedge; less
pronounced  volume  action  on  the  ﬁrst  stages  of  breakout  from  a  Rising
Wedge.  New  commitments,  in  line  with  the  implications  of  the  breakout,
may be placed on rallies or reactions after a clear breakout closing occurs,
carrying beyond the trendlines forming the Wedge.

One-Day Reversals

One-Day Reversals are not technical patterns suitable for trading in the same
sense as the important Reversal and Consolidation pictures we have exam-
ined. They are mainly useful as a gauge in helping to ﬁnd the precise Top
or  Bottom  of  a  Minor  Move  in  order  to  protect  proﬁts  on  commitments
previously made. The One-Day Reversal, the Exhaustion Gap, and the day
of  exceptionally  heavy  volume  following  several  days  of  movement  in  a
Minor Trend are strong indications that the move may have run out. Any of
these  three  signals  is  worth  watching  for;  any  two  of  them  together  carry
more  weight  than  one  alone;  and  the  appearance  of  all  three  carries  very
strong implications of a Minor 

(EN: or even a Major)

 Top or Bottom.

So  far  as  trading  on  movements  signaled  by  One-Day  Reversals,  this
type of trading would lie almost in the ﬁeld of gambling, or at least trading
for  quick,  small  proﬁts  on  short  moves.  It  would  not  be  the  same  kind  of
trading  at  all  that  we  have  been  studying  in  the  greater  part  of  this  book.
The indications and some suggestions for trading on those one-day moves
are covered in the discussion of them in Chapter 10.

Flags and Pennants

In  many  cases,  the  total  decline  from  a  Flag  in  an  uptrend  will  bring  the
price back to a point where the stock may be bought according to our regular
trading  tactics,  that  is,  the  decline  may  carry  down  to  the  Basic  (Red)
Trendline, to the Blue Parallel, or make a 40 to 50% correction of the rising
“mast” preceding the Flag. If the “mast” move is the ﬁrst such move out of
a level or only moderately rising trend, and if the Major Trend of the market

It  is  rather  hard,  with  a  formation  of  this  sort,  to  say  at  what  precise  point  the
convergence  of  the  trends  is  established.  The  breakout  move  late  in  April  was,  of
course, normal; the stock was a buy on the next reaction. The following advance in
May, which reached 23
, did not carry out a Parallel Trend Channel, and we saw a
tendency to converge as prices retreated on the reaction. The next three advances all
repeated and conﬁrmed the Wedge picture, and at the top, we see a sort of “bunching
up”  as  prices  make  little  or  no  headway.  The  chances  are  that  at  11  an  alert  trader
would have taken proﬁts on long commitments after the high volume appeared at
the top of the Minor Move ending June 4 and 5. In any case, he would have main-
tained a protective stop at all times to take him out if and when a downside breakout
occurred.

is  Bullish,  we  would  be  justiﬁed  in  buying  at  the  ﬁrst  opportunity,  which
would be on the Blue Parallel. In such a case we would expect, and ordinarily
get, some further reaction, but it is important to get in early because some-
times the reaction is very brief, and does not meet either of the other require-
ments for the correction. It is most important in a situation like this that the
volume  drop  off  sharply.  Volume  must  decrease  and  remain  slight.  Any
increase of volume during the formation of the Flag should be reviewed as
casting  suspicion  on  the  entire  pattern,  except,  of  course,  the  increasing
volume  that  characteristically  attends  the  start  of  the  breakout  drive.  This
drive is usually so virile that we would be safe in placing a tight (⅛ point)
stop under the close of any day during formation of a Flag or Pennant that
showed notably increased volume. So that if the volume indicated failure of
the pattern, we would be taken out at once; but if the breakout was under
way, we would probably be left in, since the stock would ordinarily move
up then without a reaction, very often making a Breakaway Gap.

In downward movements, when the Major Trend of the market is Bear-
ish, the same suggestions would apply, with one difference. The ﬁnal high
day  of  the  Flag-type  of  rally  may  be  on  high  volume,  and,  of  course,  may
also show the Exhaustion Gap or One-Day Reversal. If a short sale has been
made  into  such  a  day  showing  high  volume,  gap,  or  One-Day  Reversal,  a
stop  order  placed  above  the  peak  of  the  Flag  will  protect  you  should  the
advance be resumed unexpectedly.

In either the up-moving or down-moving manifestations of this type of
action, there may be Flags having horizontal Tops and Bottoms, which are,
of  course,  Rectangles.  If  the  drying-up  of  volume  and  other  aspects  of  the
picture, including the sharp upward or downward move preceding it, sug-
gest a Flag-type Consolidation, you would be justiﬁed in making a commit-
ment on the sixth Reversal point, or for that matter, at almost any point in
the pattern (since you cannot expect this pattern to continue very long).

Flags and Pennants which do continue too long (over 3 weeks) are open
to question. Stops should then be set at the usual computed distance above
or  below  their  extreme  Tops  or  Bottoms  (as  the  case  may  be).  The  fairly
frequent appearance of Flag-like Formations which eventually fail is unfor-
tunate,  since  it  is  particularly  hard  to  give  up  hoping  with  this  kind  of
pattern, and it is necessary to set the 3-week time limit to prevent the stock
from drifting all the way back to previously established stop levels. On the
other hand, breakout moves from these patterns, when completed normally,
are among the fastest and most proﬁtable forms of market action.

The question remains what to do in the case of stocks you may be holding
as they go into Flag or Pennant Formation. Obviously, they should be held
if  you  are  long  and  the  move  leading  to  the  Flag  is  up;  or  short  positions
should  be  retained  if  the  move  is  down.  However,  this  would  not  happen

FIGURE 223. A Pennant in Martin–Parry. This type of pattern is fairly common in
fast-moving markets. The extraordinary point about Flags and Pennants (and some-
times other Consolidation Patterns in fast moves) is their tendency to form almost
exactly halfway between Bottom and Top.

Just  before  this  move,  “MRT”  had  built  a  Rectangle  between  10  and  12  lasting
7 months, which followed the 1944 rise from around 4 to 12. The May breakout on
heavy volume carried “MRT” right to the top of the Pennant without any adequate
reaction. Note the increase of volume at the top of that rise. For 3 weeks prices drifted
off  with  a  drying  up  of  volume  that  is  clearly  shown  in  the  chart.  The  pattern  did
not correct the entire ﬁrst phase, but found Support at the Minor Peak at 14½.

Suddenly,  on  high  volume,  the  move  was  resumed,  and  this  time  went  right  up
to 24¾. The chances are that traders who were still long their original stock or who
had bought in around 15 on the Pennant would have sold after the high volume of
June 6 when “MRT” reached 19⅞.

FIGURE  224. This  daily  chart  of  Lehigh  Valley  R.R.  through  late  1945  and  early
1946  shows  a  variety  of  gaps. At  this  particular  time,  “LV”  was  completing  a  Sec-
ondary Corrective Move before making one more (and as it turned out, ﬁnal) effort
to  exceed  the  1945  Top  just  above  17.  This  long-term  situation  could  be  used  for  a
discussion of Double Tops, since the Bottom of the intervening move was violated
in  the  summer  of  1946  and  the  stock  continued  a  downward  course  to  below  the
5 level.

Not all gaps are signiﬁcant; for example, the ﬁrst gap shown, on October 3, when
the  stock  was  moving  in  a  narrow  range  on  low  volume.  The  gap  on  Saturday,
November  3,  however,  is  important,  since  the  Saturday  volume  (when  doubled)  is
high. The move failed to qualify by a 3% new high closing as a true breakout, but
the implications of the move were Bullish and might well have justiﬁed purchases
on Minor Reactions. The low-volume gaps on these reactions were of no particular
interest.

It is not until the third week of January that we see another gap that looks like a
real breakaway. On January 14, with high volume, “LV” moved up and out in a rush
that took it to 15⅞ on January 16, closing at 15½. The second appearance of volume
here would have suggested application of progressive stops, and long trades would
have been closed out at 15⅜.

New purchases could have been made on the reaction at 14½. A second advance
accompanied  by  a  Breakaway  Gap  developed  on  January  23.  If  we  consider  the
second  gap  (of  January  24)  a  Runaway  or  Measuring  Gap,  we  would  estimate  the
probable top of this move at around 17¾. However, when a third gap appeared on
January  28  with  a  One-Day  Reversal  and  climactic  volume,  it  would  be  clear  that
this move was about ﬁnished, and progressive stops would be used to clear out longs
at 16¾.

Note the attempt to rally after the sharp drop, and the One-Day Island formed by

two gaps as “LV” fails to hold at the 15 level.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

ordinarily if you had followed the trading rules strictly. In most cases, your
signals  calling  for  tight  (⅛  point)  progressive  stops  would  have  appeared
during the formation of the “mast.” You would have been taken out of the
picture  somewhere  along  the  way,  possibly  at  the  extreme  top  of  the  mast
(though ordinarily, you could not count on being so fortunate).

If, however, no signal should appear, and you still are holding a position
as the Flag starts to make its appearance, by all means hold your position.
The odds favor a continuation of the original move.

Now  if  you  have  been  holding  the  stock  long  (in  a  Bull  Market),  and
have seen it break out and start leaping to new highs, say from 20 to 32, and
you have been stopped out at 30, and then you see the price advance, halt
and  during  the  next  several  days  retreat,  with  the  rather  high  previous
volume drying up to practically nothing (it must be a drastic drying-up, and
no  mistake  about  it),  then  you  are  justiﬁed  in  buying  right  back  in  again,
even at a higher price than you received only a few days before.

Gaps

If  you  are  long  a  stock  which  is  in  a  well-marked  pattern  formation,  or  in
an area of dull movement within fairly narrow limits, and the stock suddenly
breaks  out  on  the  upside  with  high  volume  and  a  gap,  that  is  a  Bullish
indication. You  will  hold  the  stock  until  signs  of  exhaustion  appear  as  the
rise continues, or reappearance of high volume, or another gap or One-Day
Reversal. Then, particularly if two or all three of these indications show up
at the same time, you can protect your commitment with tight progressive
stops. You will have to consider whether a second gap should be considered
an exhaustion gap or a continuation gap, depending on the volume and the
speed of the rise, as discussed in the chapters on gaps and their measuring
implications.

Ordinarily, after a Breakaway Gap, regardless of whether you sell on the
next Minor Top, you would consider the move Bullish, and would prepare
to make a purchase on the next reaction.

Now  if  you  are  long  a  stock,  and  during  the  course  of  a  sharp  rise  it
develops a gap after several days of the move, you must make your decision
as to whether or not it is a Continuation (Runaway) Gap. If so, you would
prepare to hold the stock for a further rise approximately equal to the rise
up to the gap; and you would watch the approach to the ultimate objective
indicated very closely, so that, on the appearance then of Reversal signals,
you could protect your holding with tight stops.

If you are satisﬁed that a gap following a good rise is actually an Exhaus-
tion Gap, then you should protect your stock with a tight progressive stop
at once.

In Bear Markets, you would apply these same rules in reverse to your
short  sales,  remembering  that  a  downside  breakaway  is  not  necessarily
accompanied by the high volume you expect on an upside breakaway.

Where  you  are  long  or  short  a  stock  which  is  moving  in  a  Pattern
Formation, and the stock then makes a Breakaway Gap in the adverse direc-
tion,  the  commitment  should  be  closed  out  immediately  at  the  market,  or
on tight progressive stops.

Support and Resistance

When  you  are  long  a  stock,  you  do  not  want  to  see  it  violate  any  Minor
Bottoms previously made. Neither do you want to see it violate any of the
preceding Minor Tops which it has surpassed. Therefore, your stop orders
will be placed at a computed distance, as explained in Chapter 27 on stop
orders, using both the Minor Bottoms and the Minor Tops as Basing Points.
Normally, the Minor Bottom most recently formed will be at the approximate
level  of  the  preceding  Minor  Top,  so  that  often  these  Basing  Points  will
coincide. Ordinarily, therefore, in a rising trend, we look to the most recently
formed Minor Bottom. When the stock has, for 3 days, made a price range
which is entirely above the entire range of the day marking this Bottom, you
may move up your stop protection to a place indicated by this new Basing
Point.

The  same  procedure  will  apply  in  Bear  Markets;  the  “three-day”  rule
being  used  to  conﬁrm  Basing  Points  established  by  Minor  Peaks  and  also
by the preceding Minor Bottoms. But, ordinarily, it will be sufﬁcient to use
the Minor Peaks as Basing Points.

Intermediate  Tops  and  Bottoms  are  used  in  determining  the  probable
objectives  of  Intermediate  Moves,  since  previous  Tops  constitute  Support
under  Intermediate  Reactions,  and  previous  Bottoms  indicate  Resistance
over Intermediate Rallies.

Multiple Tops are Support Levels. Multiple Bottoms are Resistance Lev-
els. The neckline of a Head-and-Shoulders Pattern is a Support or Resistance
Level,  as  the  case  may  be.  The  apex  of  a  Symmetrical  Triangle  is  a  strong
Support and Resistance point which may show its effect again on a subse-
quent move. Any congestion or area at a certain price level or within narrow
price limits may provide Support or Resistance when a stock moves again
to that price or range.

Trendlines

We have already gone into the methods of following trends in stocks, and
the use of the Top and Bottom Trendlines (Basic and Return Lines) as indi-
cators  of  Bullish  and  Bearish  opportunities,  and  as  price  determinants  for
executing purchases or short sales.

There remains the tactical problem of the stock in which you are com-
mitted, which is acting badly, but which has neither broken out of a recog-
nized pattern nor violated an established Minor Peak. This is not a common
situation, but it can present a very difﬁcult problem when it does come up.

FIGURE 225. This daily chart in Northern Paciﬁc, covering 6 months during 1944,
shows several examples of Support and Resistance. The entire chart covers only part
of the series of Consolidations that took place in 1943 and 1944 preceding the 1945–46
advance that carried beyond 38.

Support and Resistance phenomena appear, of course, on many, in fact on most of
the charts in this book, and you will ﬁnd them on the charts you set up for yourself.
There  is  nothing  unique  or  even  unusual  about  the  Support–Resistance  action  in
“NP.”

Starting at the left in April, after the downside move on volume to 14¼, notice the
recovery  to  15⅝  where  the  move  stops  at  the  Resistance  Level  of  the  preceding
2 weeks. After the formation of the Symmetrical Triangle, there is a breakaway move
with  a  gap  which  runs  right  on  up  to  above  17,  where  a  small  Rectangle  is  built
during  the  next  3  weeks.  The  stock  ultimately  breaks  down  from  this  pattern  on
considerable  volume.  It  is  doubtful  whether  one  would  want  to  trade  on  this  as  a
normal reaction after the breakout from the Triangle, because of the downside volume
and the implications of the Rectangle.

However,  note  how  the  reaction  stops  cold  at  the  15  line,  the  apex  level  of  the
Triangle,  and  then  moves  right  on  up.  Rather  surprisingly,  there  is  only  a  3-day
hesitation at the Bottom of the Rectangle, but a little setback occurs at the Top of that
pattern.

The July Top might be classed as a Head-and-Shoulders or Complex or Rounding
Top; in fact, it is almost a Rectangle, and after the downside breakout, prices hesitate
at the level of the Top of the May Rectangle, continue down, ﬁnd temporary Support
again at the April Support Shelf around 16, and ultimately wind up a bit under 15.
Although  “NP”  actually  did  penetrate  and  close  slightly  below  the  apex  of  the
Triangle, the violation was barely 3%, and it is interesting to note that this September
Bottom  was  the  lowest  point  reached.  From  here,  the  stock  started  its  climb  to  the
38 level, which was reached in December 1945.

FIGURE 226. Trendlines in American Steel Foundries. This daily chart shows the
tendency of trendlines to develop along straight channels. We have already pointed
out  that  these  channels  are  frequently  easier  to  see  in  retrospect  than  during  their
formation, that stocks move in perfect channels only occasionally, and that all chan-
nels come to an end, frequently without warning. In this case, the long trend channel
does give a warning of Reversal.

In 1946, “FJ” had declined from 48 to a Support Level of 30. From here it rallied
for 3 months in a Trend Channel that brought us to the February Top at 37. The next
decline broke the previous trend, and volume developed at the bottom of this break.
If you will follow the entire chart, you will notice that volume nearly always shows
an increase at the points of Reversal, which are also usually points of contact with
the Trend Channel. Notice also the way the Corrective Rallies tend to stop at or near
the previous Minor Bottoms in the downward trend, and how reactions tend to stop
at the previous Minor Tops in the upward trend.

Trading on this situation would have been proﬁtable. The Secondary Intermediate
Rally  up  to  February  approached  the  Resistance  Level  marked  by  a  1946  Bottom
around  40,  and  a  correction  of  the  drop  from  48  to  30  would  indicate  short  sales
around 37 (which objective was just barely reached). Such sales, if made, would have
been covered after the ﬁrst drop (week of March 1) around 33¼. New shorts at 34½
would have been closed in the week of March 15 at about 31½. Shorts made on the
rally of the March 22 week around 33 would be covered in the week of April 19 at
30. If shorted again, the same week at 31, the sale would have been covered after the
Climactic Bottom in the week of May 24; and the combination, here, of great volume
and a One-Day Reversal would have warned against further shorts.

The Rising Channel, being a Secondary, presumably of limited extent, would not
offer any great inducement to long-side trading in the absence of other good reasons.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Let  us  say  the  Major  Trend  is  Bullish,  and  a  certain  stock  which  has  been
moving up irregularly in a Parallel Trend Channel conﬁrms its uptrend by
a long, more or less continuous advance and calls for repurchase on the next
reaction. You buy on the reaction, and the stock continues down; that is, the
reaction  continues  with  prices  sagging  for  days  and  weeks,  without  any
rallies,  Consolidations,  or  Corrections  that  are  sufﬁciently  well-deﬁned  to
serve as Basing Points for stop orders.

In the absence of clear indications during the reaction, and also during
the preceding large upward move, your stop would be placed at a computed
distance below the top of the preceding rise. And if the reaction continues down
until that level is reached, you will have sustained an abnormally large loss.
In  a  case  like  this,  you  should  examine  the  trendlines  making  up  the
long  advance  in  the  Trend  Channel.  The  points  of  contact  with  the  Basic
Trendline can serve as a fair emergency substitute for Minor Bottoms. Your
stop level should, therefore (in the absence of more deﬁnite Basing Points),
be placed at the computed distance below the last point at which the stock
made contact with the bottom trendline and moved decisively up away from
it. If penetration and close below this point occurs without catching the stop,
sell on tight progressive stops. EN: The editor feels that such situations should
occur  only  in  position  building  or  pyramiding  cases.  Every  effort  should  be  made
to join trends on breakout or origination, whatever the source. There is no excuse
for “chasing stocks” in the modern environment where literally monitoring all stocks
is possible with a computer, and instructing the system to alert one to the conditions
attending  breakouts.  EN9:  On  the  other  hand,  human  frailty  being  what  it  is  we
will all ﬁnd ourselves chasing a train at some time or other.

The reverse of this rule would apply to the same type of situation in a
Bear Market, where stops for short sales would be placed at the computed
distance above the point at which the stock made contact with and fell away
from the upper trendline.

The changes of angularity and direction in Intermediate trendlines are

helpful in showing the gradual turning of a Major Trend.

A Quick Summation 
of Tactical Methods

There  are  three  types  of  tactical  operations:  (1)  Getting  into  new  commit-
ments; (2) getting out of commitments which have moved as expected and
show  a  proﬁt;  and  (3)  getting  out  of  commitments  which  have  not  moved
as expected, whether the transaction shows a proﬁt or a loss.

The principles of taking proﬁts based on trends, Resistance and Support
Levels, measuring implications of patterns, and most especially, on the daily
technical and volume action of the stock, already have been covered. These
proﬁt-taking  operations  seldom  present  very  difﬁcult  problems,  since  the
picture has developed normally and in the way you hoped and expected it
would. The “stepping off” point is usually easy to determine.

The more difﬁcult problems arise in making new commitments correctly,
and  in  the  very  important  defensive  operations  of  getting  out  of  losing
commitments with the least possible loss.

It should be emphasized that a stock which has ceased to act in a Bullish
manner and which should, therefore, be sold is not necessarily a short sale
on the next rally. In other words, the signal that shows weakness or failure
of a move in one trend is not always a signal to make new commitments on
the opposite side of the market. More often than not, in fact, it is nothing of
the kind.

We know that certain moves, such as adverse breakouts from Symmet-
rical Triangles or Rectangles, advise us simultaneously to get out of commit-
ments in what is now clearly the “wrong” direction and to make new com-
mitments in the “right” direction. The simple failure of a trendline, however,
where the stock merely penetrates an old Minor Bottom without completing
a Head-and-Shoulders or other Reversal Pattern, although reason enough to
get  out  of  commitments  which  are  showing  losses,  is  not  sufﬁciently  con-
clusive, by itself, to justify reversing policy and making new commitments
in the opposite direction. Therefore we separate the two types of signals as
follows:

Get out of present commitments
• On adverse breakout from Head-and-Shoulders Formation.
• On adverse breakout from Symmetrical Triangle.

• On adverse breakout from Rectangle.
• On establishment of new Minor low or new Minor high in adverse

direction.

• On adverse breakout from Diamond.
• On adverse breakout from Wedge.
• On One-Day Reversal if marked by heavy volume or a gap.
• On adverse breakout from Flag or Pennant.
• On  clear  penetration  of  any  Resistance  or  Support  Level  in  the  ad-

verse direction.

• On an adverse Breakaway Gap.
• On the appearance of an Island after a move in the favorable direc-

tion.

• On penetration of basic trendline in the absence of pattern or other

favorable criteria.

Note: 
It is understood that all breakouts must close in the breakout
area. A closing 3% beyond the Support, trend, or pattern is sufﬁcient
to give the danger signal. All takeouts are performed by the use of
⅛

-point progressive stops.

Make new commitments
• In  line  with  the  Major  Dow  Trend,  or  to  a  limited  extent  in  coun-

tertrend moves as insurance to reduce overall risk.

• On breakout from Head-and-Shoulders Pattern.
• On breakout from Symmetrical Triangle, provided it is not working

into the ﬁnal third of its length toward the apex.

• On breakout from Right-Angle Triangle.
• On breakout from Rectangle, or (possibly) on points of contact, be-

ginning with the sixth Reversal.
• On breakout from a Broadening Top.
• On  breakout  from  Double  or  Multiple  Top  or  Bottom.  (By  this  is
meant breakout through the Bottom of the valley between Tops, or
upside penetration of the “dome” between Bottoms.)

• On  breakout  from  Wedge,  or  (possibly)  commitments  within  the

Wedge in the last third of its length as it approaches its apex.

• On Flags and Pennants, after sufﬁcient Secondary or Corrective Move
by the pattern, or (possibly) within the pattern, provided that volume
and all other indications tend strongly to conﬁrm the pattern.
• On clear penetration of a well-deﬁned Support or Resistance Area.
• On Breakaway Gap (possibly).
• After  formation  of  an  important  and  well-deﬁned  Island  following

a considerable move.

• On contact with, or penetration of, the “favorable” trendline if both
trendlines  are  moving  in  the  Major  Trend  direction.  (Blue  Top
Trendline in a Bull Market, Red Bottom Trendline in a Bear Market.)

Note: 
Breakouts and penetrations must show a closing in the brea-
kout area and must conform to volume requirements. Breakout clos-
ings should conform to the 3% rule.

New  commitments  (marked  “possibly”)  may  be  made  in  certain  cases
within some patterns: Rectangles, Wedges, Flags, and Pennants. Exceptional
care should be used in such cases.

Effect of Technical Trading 
on Market Action

The question often is asked whether the very fact that traders are studying
methods and patterns tends to create those very patterns and trends — in
other  words,  whether  the  technical  method  sets  up,  to  some  extent,  an
artiﬁcial market in which the market action is merely the reﬂection of chart
action instead of the reverse.

This does not seem to be true. The charts we make today seem to follow
the old patterns; the presumption is very strong that markets have followed
these  patterns  long  before  there  were  any  technicians  to  chart  them.  The
differences mentioned brieﬂy in Part One, due to changed margin require-
ments,  restraining  of  manipulative  practices,  etc.,  seem  to  have  changed
these habits, if at all, only in degree and not in their fundamental nature.

Gargantuan.) 
Its operation is extremely free, and extremely democratic in the
sense that it represents the integration of the hopes and fears of many kinds
of  buyers  and  sellers.  Not  all  are  short-term  traders.  There  are  investors,
industrialists, employees of corporations, those who buy to keep, those who
buy to sell years later — all grades and types of buyers and sellers.

And not all short-term traders are technicians by any manner of means.
There  are  those  who  trade  on  fundamentals  for  the  short  term;  those  who
rely  on  tips,  hunches,  on  reading  the  stars,  on  personal  knowledge  of  the
company.  They  are  all  part  of  the  competitive  market,  they  are  all  using
methods different from yours — and sometimes they will be right and you
will be wrong.

The technician using the various tools of technical analysis, Dow Theory,
Point-and-Figure charts, oscillators, scale order systems, and monthly, weekly,
and daily charts is in the minority. The cold attempt to analyze a situation
on  the  basis  of  the  market  record  alone  does  not  appeal  to  many  people.
Technical analysis leaves out the warmth and human interest of the board-
room,  the  trading  room,  the  fascinating  rumors  of  fat  extra  dividends  to
come, the whispered information on new patents, and the thrilling study of

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

It  is  the  inﬂuence  of  all  these  rumors,  facts,  and  statistics  that  causes
people to buy and sell their stocks. It is their actions that build the familiar
chart patterns. You are not interested in why they are doing what they are
doing.  So  far  as  your  trading  is  concerned,  you  are  interested  only  in  the
results of their actions.

The habits and evaluative methods of people are deeply ingrained. The
same kinds of events produce the same kinds of emotional responses, and
hence, the same kinds of market action. These characteristic approaches are
extremely durable. It is not quite true that “you can’t change human nature,”
but  it  is  true  that  it  is  very  difﬁcult  to  change  the  perceptive  habits  of  a
lifetime. And since the “orthodox” investors greatly outnumber the techni-
cians, we may conﬁdently assume that technical trading will have little or
no effect on the typical behavior of free markets.

EN: This statement by Magee is still true in principle. And, it should be noted
that in modern markets professional investors attempt to learn (or perhaps it is “the
”) what makes systems and other investors suc-
mysterious and anomalous 
cessful. They then take action to frustrate those methods which are inimical to their
self-interest.  For  example,  locals  and  professionals  will  search  for  stops  above  a
congestion zone in an attempt to cause the market to break away. This might be in
an attempt to create a trend, or it might be in an attempt to create a bull trap.

market

The proliferation of systems trend traders in the futures markets has, some of
those traders feel, created conditions hostile to systems traders as a group. The moral
of the story is that the trader/investor must be ever alert for the false move and the
changing rhythm of the markets.

No one has been able to quantify chart analysis, nor to disguise his own activities
from  the  x-ray  of  the  charts.  Nor  has  anyone  changed  human  nature  to  eliminate
treachery and perﬁdy and truculent defense of self-interest.

EN9: And – dramatic drum roll – in 2005 Smith-Barney ﬁres its entire technical
analysis  staff.  What  to  make  of  this  is  left  to  the  imagination  of  the  reader.  Some
commentators attribute it to the bearish outlook of the technical staff as opposed to
the need of the ﬁrm to sell long positions to its customers. In my view an unintended
validation  of  the  craft.  When  you  have  to  shoot  the  messenger  it  says  something
about the state of the market, as well as something about the industry.

Also, in conversation at a meeting of the Technical Securities Analysts Asso-
ciation of San Francisco (tsaasf.org), Larry Williams: “I hate technical analysis.” I
am  reasonably  certain  that  the  “technical  analysis”  referred  to  is  number  driven
analysis.

Automated Trendline: 
The Moving Average

There  was  a  time  back  in  1941  when  we  were  still  ﬁlled  with  starry-eyed
ignorance,  and  we  felt  that  if  only  we  worked  hard  enough  and  looked
shrewdly enough, we would discover the sure, unbeatable formula or system
that  would  solve  all  our  problems  in  the  stock  market,  and  all  we  would
have to do for the rest of life was apply the magic and telegraph our broker
periodically  from  Nassau,  or  Tahiti,  or  Switzerland,  or  wherever  we  hap-
pened to be enjoying life at the time.

We have learned (we hope) quite a bit since then. We have learned most
particularly  a  number  of  things  not  to  do;  and  by  not  repeating  the  same
errors over and over, we have been able to improve our performance sub-
(EN: still true in the 21st century)
stantially. We have also learned that (to date) 
there are no sure, unbeatable formulas or systems in the market, that even
the  most  useful  and  generally  dependable  forecasting  methods  must  be
regarded as statements of probability only, subject to revision and vulnerable
to failure at times.

One  of  the  useful  tools,  and  one  of  the  ﬁrst  many  students  of  market
action  adopt,  is  the  trendline.  Whether  a  stock  is  moving  generally  up,  or
generally down, or generally sideways, there seems to be a tendency for the
Major Trend to continue, to persist. It is true that every trend is broken sooner
or later, and the fact that it has been broken is often signiﬁcant. But given a
well-established trend, the probabilities certainly appear to favor its contin-
uance rather than its Reversal.

However, as with all other market studies, there are times and conditions
in which the simple trendline action seems “not quite good enough.” One
feels  that  there  should  be  some  mechanical  or  mathematical  way  of  deter-
mining the trend that might avoid some of the perplexities of choosing the
right point through which to draw a trendline. And, it was back in 1941 that
we delightedly made the discovery (though many others had made it before)
that by averaging the data for a stated number of days, or weeks, or months,
one  could  derive  a  sort  of  Automated  Trendline  which  would  deﬁnitely
interpret  the  changes  of  trend  over  the  past  30 days,  or  200 days,  or  12
months,  or  whatever  period  was  chosen.  It  seemed  almost  too  good  to  be
true. As a matter of fact, it was too good to be true.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

The Moving Average is a fascinating tool, and it has real value in show-
ing the trend of an irregular series of ﬁgures (like a ﬂuctuating market) more
clearly. It also has value in that it can be used to cancel out the effect of any
regular cyclical variation, such as a normal seasonal range of temperatures
in order to get a better picture of the true secular trend.

The  trouble  with  a  Moving  Average  (and  which  we  discovered  long
since,  but  keep  bumping  into  from  time  to  time)  is  that  it  cannot  entirely
escape from its past. The smoother the curve (longer cycle) one has, the more
“inhibited”  it  is  in  responding  to  recent  important  changes  of  trend.  And
there is a very bad fault of Moving Averages in that “the tail tends to wag
the dog”; the ﬁgures back to the ﬁrst date of the current tabulation, perhaps
6 months ago, or a year ago, if they are large, may unduly affect the present
average, and may conceal or mask some important feature by distorting the
curve.

We feel the Moving Averages trendlines are useful. But they should be
understood  and  used  with  discretion,  and  with  a  full  perception  of  their
limitations.

Now that we have gone through some of the caveats of Moving Aver-
ages, let us give you some of the ways to construct them. Moving Averages
can be classiﬁed as Simple Moving Averages, Weighted or Exponential Mov-
ing Averages, and Linear Moving Averages. We prefer, and have found over
the years, that the simple methods work just as well and sometimes better
than the more complicated Moving Averages, and the others are more useful
when using computers.

For  this  reason,  we  will  concentrate  on  Simple  Moving Averages.  The
most common are the 50-day and the 200-day Moving Averages. If you want
to increase the sensitivity of a Moving Average, shorten the Moving Average
by using 10 or 20 days. Another way is to increase the lead time by starting
on  the  third  day  for  the  10-day  Moving Average,  or  on  the  20th  day  for  a
50-day Moving Average, etc.

To  construct  a  Simple  Moving  Average,  whether  it  is  5 days,  10 days,
50 days  or  200 days,  you  add  the  price  of  5 days,  and  divide  by  5,  or  the
10 days and divide by 10, or the 50 days by 50, or 200 days by 200. A simple
way of doing the 5-day Moving Average, instead of adding all 5 prices each
time, is to drop day 1 and add day 6. A similar method can be used in doing
the  50-day  Moving  Average  or  the  200-day  Moving  Average.  Instead  of
adding the 50-day Moving Average each time, just drop the ﬁrst day of the
previous average and add the 51st day. The same with the 200-day Moving
Average;  drop  the  ﬁrst  day  of  the  previous  200  and  add  the  201st  day.
Another way of doing the 200-day Moving Average is to take one day of the
week  of  30 weeks,  such  as  Wednesday  or  Thursday,  add  them  and  divide
by  30.  This  will  give  you  the  same  Moving  Averages  as  you  would  have
doing 200. Another way to put it is, on the second day, take the total, add
the  new  day’s  price,  and  subtract  the  oldest  day’s  price  from  your  5-day
Moving  Average,  10-day  Moving  Average,  50-day,  or  200-day,  whichever
way you are doing it. Repeat the process on a daily basis and divide by the

representative day — for the 5-day, you would divide by 5; for the 10-day,
you would divide by 10; for the 50-day, divide by 50; and for the 200-day,
you would divide by 200.

Sensitizing Moving Averages

The shorter the time period, the greater the sensitivity you will develop in
your Moving Average. The 5-day Moving Average will be much more sen-
sitive than a 10-day. The problem with short-term Moving Averages is that
you can have a greater number of false moves. Shorter Moving Averages are
more  suitable  for  commodities.  On  commodities,  we  would  even  advise
using a 30-hour, a 3-day, and a 6-day Moving Average.

It  is  often  better  to  use  two  Moving Averages,  one  of  shorter  duration
and  one  of  longer  duration.  In  addition,  you  can  use  channels,  a  Moving
Average of lows, and a Moving Average of highs.

Crossovers and Penetrations

As  a  general  rule,  consider  the  crossing  of  two  lines  by  the  price  line  as  a
sell or buy signal in the direction of the crossover or penetration.

1. Uptrends  —  Long  positions  are  retained  as  long  as  the  price  trend

remains above the Moving Average Line.
a. When the price line intersects or penetrates the Moving Average

Line on the upside, it activates a buy signal.

b. When the price line goes above the 200-day Moving Average, but
falls sharply toward it without penetration, it is a buy signal.
c. When the price line falls below the Moving Average Line while

the line is still rising, it could be a buy signal.

d. When the price line spikes down too fast and far below a declining
Moving Average Line, a short-term rebound toward the line may
be expected: a possible whipsaw trap.

2. Downtrends  —  Short  positions  are  held  as  long  as  the  price  trend
remains below the Moving Average. When the price trend reaches a
bottom and turns upward, a penetration of the Moving Average is a
buy signal.
a. When the price line moves above the average line while the av-

erage line is still falling, it is a sell signal.

b. When the stock price line moves below the average line and rises
toward it, but fails to penetrate and breaks down again, it is a sell
signal.
If the price line rises too fast above the rising average line, a short-
term reaction may be expected: could be a whipsaw.

c.

d. Occasionally, penetration of the Moving Average Line will occur
in  close  conjunction  with  the  penetration  of  a  trendline,  then
according to its direction, it is a buy or sell signal.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

3. Horizontal, Diagonal or Sideways Movements — If the ﬂuctuations
are broad in comparison to the length of the Moving Averages being
used,  the  price  trend  will  ﬂuctuate  back  and  forth  as  the  Moving
Average, true to its character or purpose, moves horizontally.

4. Gaps  —  Moving Averages,  depending  on  their  length,  may  have  a
tendency  to  be  penetrated  in  close  proximity  to  a  Breakaway  Cap,
particularly  at  the  beginning  of  a  Major  Phase  of  an  Intermediate
cycle,  and  also  in  such  cases  where  Breakaway  Gaps  occur  at  the
beginning of correction phases.

Area  Patterns  can  be  a  pitfall  for  the  Moving Averages.  Normally,  the
Moving Average oscillates through the center of these areas producing buy
and sell signals in rapid succession. In Area Patterns, the Moving Average
is a headache to the trader because he never knows which penetration is the
one preceding either the renewal of the trend or Conﬁrmation of a Reversal.
When  trading  areas  develop  in  the  form  of  Triangles  —  Descending,
Declining,  or  Symmetrical  —  the  Moving  Average  will  trend  through  the
center of the Triangle. The technician has some small advantage in judging
which  of  the  series  of  penetrations  of  a  Moving  Average  is  the  important
one.  When  the  Triangle  reaches  its  apex,  and  the  stock  breaks  out  in  one
direction or another and penetrates the Moving Average, the penetration is
likely to be the most important one during the sideways movement of the
Triangle’s development. Penetrations occur many times in close conjunction
with the penetration of a trendline.

As a price derivative product, the Moving Average can be a trend indi-
cator by the way it ﬁts a trendline. But, nevertheless, it should be considered
an adjunctive tool to everything else you have learned in relation to technical
analysis.

A 150-day Moving Average is charted on the following page.

during which Ronald Reagan tripled the national debt) trading the 150-day moving
average (buying on an up crossover and selling on a down crossover) gave a trader
somewhat the same advantage that trading the Dow Theory afforded. In the 1980s,
the system stopped working. But here in 1929 it would have been a life saver as can
be seen.

“The Same Old Patterns”

To the newcomer, the market appears ﬁlled with wonders and mysteries as
the landscape of Mars will appear to the ﬁrst space travelers to land there.
There  are  strange  rumblings,  apparently  unexplainable  upheavals,  weird
growths. An  unknown  stock  will  suddenly  emerge  from  a  morass  of  debt
and deﬁcit, and proceed to soar to great heights. An old and trusted issue
will paradoxically sag and droop, although apparently rooted in the soil of
economic  stability.  All  will  seem  peaceful  and  secure;  and  suddenly,  the
ground opens up and swallows values in a sensational market break.

Such  a  newcomer,  perhaps  not  realizing  what  appears  unusual  and
alarming is only the normal ﬂuctuation and adjustment that goes on contin-
ually  in  the  market  according  to  the  changing  evaluations  of  millions  of
investors, will feel frightened, insecure, and indecisive. He may scurry from
boardroom to boardroom, personally or on the telephone, scan the ﬁnancial
pages, talk with friends, accumulate a mass of conﬂicting information, and
end up shutting his eyes and making a blind stab in the hope that he may
come up with the right answer.

Some never, even after years of contact with the market, achieve a tran-

quil and assured approach.

But  it  is  possible  to  learn  something  about  the  basic  nature  of  stock
trends. It is possible to know, within reasonable limits, about what might be
expected in certain situations. And it is also possible to ﬁnd ways of coping
with  these  situations,  including  the  exceptional  cases  that  persist  in  doing
the unexpected. To repeat: It is possible to deal successfully with the unex-
pected and with that which cannot be precisely predicted.

To  put  it  another  way,  it  is  possible  to  be  wrong  part  of  the  time,  and
still to be successful on the balance. And to do this, it is only necessary to
have a background of experience sufﬁcient to know what will usually hap-
pen under particular conditions, about how often the unexpected will occur,
and  how  to  deal  with  the  unexpected  when  it  does  happen.  These  are  the
same general problems that would confront the space traveler, the chemist,
the physician, or almost anyone else in his daily affairs.

There are men who have observed the market long enough and carefully
enough to discover that there are not quite so many unexpected events as
the newcomer might be led to believe.

Chapter thirty-seven:

“The Same Old Patterns”

515

The charts in this book are, in the main, the same as used for examples
in  the  ﬁrst  edition  in  1947.  Some  of  them  show  situations  from  1928  and
EN: And still others from the 1990s and
1929, others from the 1930s and 1940s. 
the 2000s.
 The reader can hardly overlook the similarities that occur in var-
ious stocks at different times during corresponding phases of their trends or
turning points.

We have said that these same patterns, trends, and Support Resistance
phenomena  repeat  themselves  over  and  over  again,  and  that  they  may  be
observed by anyone in his own current charts for any period of time, in any
normally active stocks, and on any exchange or market.

By way of demonstration, there were included in this chapter of the ﬁfth
edition  a  number  of  typical  technical  examples,  similar  to  those  already
EN: The  eighth  edition
discussed,  but  taken  from  the  period  1947  to  1966. 
includes  examples  taken  up  through  the  turn  of  the  millennium.
  It  would  be
possible to include ten times the number of good examples, for almost every
situation that has been previously illustrated has appeared again and again
in recent years.

Downtrends seldom show the perfect and regular trendlines we often
see in uptrends. But in spite of the irregular, ragged rallies and spotty volume action,
the basic principles are about the same as for advances. Notice that in this 6-month
period Inspiration Copper had no rally which carried above the Top of a preceding
rally. A well-marked downtrend of this sort must be presumed to continue until there
is a marked change in the pattern and volume action. Notice the volume on the day
“IC” broke the historically important 52 level; and subsequent action.

FIGURE  230.
Part  of  the  Major  Advance  in  Granite  City  Steel.  Here  we  see  the
familiar phenomenon of Support and Resistance in almost every move through the
period shown.

The August–September  Rectangle  held  for  6  weeks  between  the  top  limit  of  47,
which was reached on three occasions, and the bottom at 44. Like most Rectangles,
it  was  marked  by  heavy  volume  at  the  start  on  July  19,  and  gradually  declining
volume as the pattern progressed. The breakout move on August 29 was on enormous
volume.

After this breakout, there was a typical Flag-like reaction on sharply diminished
volume; and while this move penetrated the top border of the Rectangle, the pene-
tration was not decisive or signiﬁcant, and the lower border was never violated. Now
see how volume appears on October 15 as the old high is reached, and again at the
top of the move on November 14. The decline returns to the level of the September
high on a low-volume reaction. It is interesting how, on ﬁve occasions in this chart,
the 52 level served as a Support or Resistance point: twice as Resistance on the way
up, and three times after the new October high, as Support.

On the next rise, we see almost the same type of advance. In this case, the Support-
Resistance  Level  is  about  57.  Notice  the  approach  to  the  critical  level,  the  backing
away, the aggressive move into new high ground (in mid-December), and the reces-
sion to the Support at 57.

Advances  of  this  sort  seem  to  represent  the  ebb  and  ﬂow  of  the  Minor  Moves
during a Major Trend when there are no great “news developments” to change the
normal progress of the trend. Where there are frequent and important changes in the
market or in news affecting the industry, we may see long Consolidations or Second-
ary Reactions. But the Major Trend is durable. We must not assume a Major Reversal
prematurely.

FIGURE 231.
During the same period that Granite City Steel was making the series
of steps upward, as shown in Figure 230, Masonite was doing almost the same thing
in reverse.

To have continued to hope for a change in trend with a stock which was acting as
“MNC” did through the latter part of 1956 would have required an unusual amount
of optimism or innocence about the habits of stocks. Actually, of course, there would
be good reason for optimism if the stock had been sold short early in the trend.
This is almost a perfect counterpart to the “GRC” chart. We have not only a series
of declines with rallies which fail to establish even Minor highs above the previous
Tops, but we are also able to draw a trendline which has a number of points of contact
on the way down, which is somewhat unusual in a down-trending situation.

Notice the tendency of the rallies to stop short at the level of previous bottoms in
a series of Support–Resistance Levels. We see such action at 44, at 41, at 38, and at 36.
We would certainly not consider the breaking of the trendline on the upside in late
December as evidence of a Reversal. Such a break after a trend of this sort probably
means  no  more  than  a  Secondary  Recovery.  To  be  of  greater  signiﬁcance,  it  would
certainly call for some volume showing, which was utterly lacking here; and before
we  would  consider  the  stock  again  strong  enough  to  buy  there  would  have  to  be
some  sort  of  Reversal  Pattern.  A  faltering  rally  back  to  around  40  would,  in  fact,
suggest the advisability of further short sales.

FIGURE 232.
Very often you will hear the question, “But how can you tell whether
a technical formation or a breakout is valid?” In many cases, and in a great majority
of  upside  patterns,  the  volume  gives  such  a  decisive  answer  that  all  doubts  are
removed. Not always is the volume conﬁrmation as clear as in this chart of Delaware,
Lackawanna  &  Western,  but  this  is  typical  of  a  good  many  breakouts  in  uptrends.
You will see that the volume was generally light during the Rectangle, in which we
see ﬁve plainly marked Tops and Bottoms.

On Thursday, November 4, the volume increased sharply as the price moved up
to  the  top  of  the  Rectangle  and  closed  at  that  point.  The  following  day,  Friday,  we
see good volume again with a close beyond the top border. From this point on, the
move is obviously upward.

There  was  no  indication  of  Reversal  at  any  time  after  the  breakout.  A  Top  was

reached in March at 25

½
.

This was an especially vigorous move as it came out of the Rectangle. Normally,
we  would  look  for  Minor  Setbacks  such  as  the  series  of  reactions  in  “GRC,”
Figure 230. And if these had occurred, it would in no way have weakened the Bullish
Pattern.

FIGURE  233.
The  situation,  somewhat  similar  to  “DL”  in  Figure  232,  presents  a
little complication. The problem would have been whether to sell or continue to hold
“LA” after the late October break down through the Bottom of the Rectangle. There
was no important volume on this drift move, and on only one day did the price close
barely  3%  below  the  bottom  of  the  pattern. A  holder  of  the  stock  might  well  have
sold it, might even have executed a short sale.

Suppose now, that you had actually sold the stock short. Observe the volume and
the  price  action  on  Thursday,  November  4  and  Friday,  November  5.  Notice  the
volume and the price on the following Monday and Tuesday as it reacted slightly.
Then see the quick pickup in volume as the price advanced on Wednesday, the week
and a half of dull Consolidation, and the larger volume on the move up on Friday.
Surely by the middle of the ﬁrst week of December, if not before, you would have
seen the danger signals and closed out your short.

Such a turnabout does not need to be a tragedy nor even a discouragement. Some
easily discouraged traders would be so concerned about the small loss realized on
their unsuccessful short sale that they would not be ready to seize the opportunity
to reverse position and buy the stock after the strong up signals. This move carried
to 26

 in March 1955.

Bottoms  normally  take  longer  to  complete  than  Tops.  That  is  one
reason we have this chart of Fansteel on a weekly basis, so that a year and a half of
the  action  can  be  shown.  The  pattern  shown  at  the  left  is  a  Consolidation  formed
after a rise from the 1953–54 Multiple Bottoms around 21. The top of the Ascending
Triangle corresponds roughly with the April 1953 peak.

Of  course,  at  the  time  this  Triangle  started,  in  early  1955,  it  was  not  possible  to
identify it as such — particularly since the February high ran a little higher than the
horizontal Tops that eventually formed. However, during the 7 months that preceded
the ﬁrst breakout move, it became increasingly clear that each rally to the neighbor-
hood  of  32
  was  followed  by  a  reaction  on  low  volume,  and  that  these  reactions
were forming a series of Rising Bottoms.

½

In the ﬁrst week of September we see a clean penetration upside, and from here
on, the advances and declines ﬁt into the typical pattern of a Major Advance. Notice
the Breakaway Gap in November, and the low volume throughout the December–Jan-
uary–February reaction.

FIGURE  235.
Here,  in  a  daily  chart,  we  see  once  again  the  dramatic  sequel  to  a
Descending  Triangle.  Here  is  the  typical  series  of  declining  Tops  on  rather  low
volume, with retreats between the rallies to a horizontal line.

Notice that the important Support here was violated with heavy volume on Friday,
January 25. Although the degree of penetration was not great, in view of the generally
Bearish  reaction  to  this  point  we  would  sell  at  once.  A  Descending  Triangle  has
Bearish  implications  even  before  the  breakout.  There  was  no  substantial  Pullback
after the breakout. Since it is not possible to count on such a recovery after a break
through Support, it is safest to sell long holdings immediately or to place a very near
stop on them as soon as a close outside pattern occurs (in this case, outside the pattern
as adjusted for ex-dividend).

Notice the pickup of volume as the price drops into a tailspin at the end of January.
Heavy volume is not necessarily a feature of important downside moves, but it may,
and  often  does,  accompany  them,  and  when  it  does,  it  simply  underscores  the
signiﬁcance of the move.

Question: Does Textron look like a “bargain” to you at the end of January on this
chart? Would you be tempted to buy this stock because “it can’t go down any more,”
or because it is “due for a rally,” or because it is “selling below its true value”?

Suppose that “TXT” did have a technical rally, which seems quite likely after the
move shown. How far would you look for it to go? Would you expect it to penetrate
the 20 level in the near future? Would you call this a Bullish Situation at the end of
January 1957?

The  examples  given  are  not  rare  exceptions.  There  are  many  others  involving
important stocks which did not follow the pattern set by the Averages. This variety
of behavior is typical of the market. It is to be seen today. They are 
 “all the same,”
and each stock must be studied individually. In Figures 239, 240, and 241 are a few
examples showing disparate action during the years 1953–56. There are hundreds of
others that would illustrate the point equally well.

Not All the Same

Although  a  majority  of  stocks  will  participate  in  a  big  market  trend,  they
will not all move at the same time nor to the same degree. Some will move
quite independently and contrary to the Averages. There was a “boom” in
the 1920s. And there was a Panic in October 1929. But these are inadequate
statements,  half-truths  if  you  will,  and  can  be  very  misleading  if  they  are
swallowed whole. A technician, following the individual behavior of stocks,
would  have  been  able,  through  a  balanced  and  diversiﬁed  portfolio,  to
protect himself against irreparable loss.

Here  is  a  companion  piece  to  Eagle–Picher’s  chart  of
more than 25 years ago, shown above it. Kresge, like a number of other “blue chips,”
did not participate in the Bull Market Moves of 1953–56.

These  six  charts  were  adapted  from  “Graphic  Stocks”  (F.W.  Stephens,  New  York).
The 1927–30 charts are from a Special Edition covering nearly 700 stocks through the
period 1924–35. The 1953–56 charts are from a later edition of “Graphic Stocks.”

The  facts  are  that  of  676  stocks  we  have  studied  through  the  period
1924–35, only 184 made a Bull Market Top in August–September–October 1929
and  suffered  Major  Declines  in  October  and  November  of  that  year.  There
were 262 stocks actually in Major Downtrends before the year 1929. Another
181 stocks made their Bull Market Tops in the ﬁrst 9 months of the year and
were already moving down before the end of the summer. Five stocks did not
start their decline until after 1929. And 44 stocks continued to make new highs
after 1929. In Figures 236, 237, and 238 are three stocks showing very different
trends during the years 1927–30.

A beautiful Top Formation in Northrop Aircraft, 1954-1955. The move

 in January 1955 emerged from a Bottom in 1953 at 6

¼
.

The Descending Triangle is marked by rather unusual volume at the peaks of rallies
in February and March. Otherwise it is typical of this sort of Reversal Pattern. As so
frequently happens, there was a Pullback effort after the March 14 breakout; but this
rally lasted only 2 days.

You  will  notice  that  the  volume  on  the  breakout  and  throughout  the  downside
move  was  not  so  spectacularly  heavy,  not  nearly  as  heavy,  in  fact,  as  that  on  the
Minor  Rallies  within  the  Triangle.  However,  as  pointed  out  previously,  we  do  not
need nor expect so much volume on a decline as we look for in an advance.

Volume did not develop until the end of the ﬁrst stage of the decline. It is quite
usual  for  heavy  volume  to  show  up  at  the  end  of  a  Minor  Move  whether  on  the
upside or the downside.

Notice  the  Flag  formed  on  the  subsequent  rally  in  mid-April.  The  measuring

implications of this Flag were approximately carried out a month later.
During the following year and a half “NOC” never reached 31 again.

FIGURE 243.
Bearing in mind the 1954–55 chart of Northrop in Figure 242, we now
turn to the action in this same stock in the latter part of 1956 and the beginning of
1957.  The  question,  of  course,  is  whether  the  Major  Downtrend  is  still  in  effect  or
whether an important upturn has taken place.

As  usual,  it  is  the  volume  that  must  be  watched  and  studied.  Notice  the  Minor
Peak on August 14, then the very heavy volume on August 24. See how the activity
dries up during September, but resumes briskly as a new Minor Top is established
in October. Observe the drying-up of volume on declines and the activity on rallies
to the 25
 level, which, by the middle of December, has become the horizontal Top
of an Ascending Triangle.

There was no question about the validity of the breakout move on December 10;
and the subsequent reaction in the next 2 weeks conﬁrmed this by the lack of activity
on  the  decline. And  again,  in  early  February,  we  see  volume  pick  up  notably  as  a
new high is registered.

(EN: 1957)

At the time this is written 

, it is not possible to say whether or not “NOC”
will continue this upward course and eventually smash the “31 barrier.” But we feel
there  will  be  no  doubt  in  the  reader’s  mind  that  at  the  beginning  of  February,
Northrop  was  presumably  moving  in  an  uptrend,  and  must  be  presumed  to  be  in
that trend until a deﬁnite change in its market action has taken place. It seems quite
probable  that  if  “NOC”  should  advance  to  the  30–31  level,  there  is  likely  to  be  a
period  of  Consolidation  with  the  formation  of  an Area  Pattern  before  a  successful
advance above 31 is accomplished.

As a sidelight on this chart, it might be mentioned here that during the period of

advance shown above many aircraft stocks were moving lower.

Chapter thirty-seven:

“The Same Old Patterns”

527

FIGURE 244.
The 1954–55 advance in Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Paciﬁc is an
object lesson in Bull Market technics. Where would such a trend (of which there are
many similar cases) leave the man who sells just “because he has a good proﬁt,” say
at 15, or who feels “17 is too high a price”?

Here is a chart that is worth considerable study, since it exempliﬁes a great many
features of the “ideal” uptrend. In this full year of advance, there is no point at which
even  a  tyro  technician  could  ﬁnd  reasonable  cause  for  anxiety  or  justiﬁcation  for
selling the stock. And we should not overlook the tax advantages of long-term gains.
Here,  in August  and  September,  we  have  a  perfect  example  of  the  Symmetrical
Triangle as a Consolidation. The volume is typically heavy at the start of the pattern
and shrinks to almost nothing as it progresses. The breakout volume is decisive. The
reaction after the breakout, also on lower volume, as it should be, runs right back to
the  apex,  the  “cradle  point”  which  is  nearly  always  a  strong  Support  on  such  a
reaction.

Now  follow  the  action  from  here.  The  two  days  of  higher  volume  in  the  early
November rally represent the penetration of the previous Minor Top, and the end of
the rally, respectively. The reaction comes back to the previous top.

The  December  rally  is  marked  by  heavier  volume  when  the  November  top  is
exceeded, and again, to a lesser degree, at the end of the move. Once more there is
a reaction, this time to the November top.

A fast move near the end of December repeats the same price and volume action,
and is followed by a typical low-volume reaction to the early December top. (This
is becoming monotonous. But it is important. You are seeing here a long-term dem-
onstration of Bullish technical action.)

Next we have the January breakout. How far would you expect its Minor Reaction
to go? Would you be surprised if it found Support at the level of the three little Tops
formed early in the month at 17

½
?

The following advance drives through the 20 level, and, in a series of small ﬂuc-
tuations,  forms  an  Ascending  Triangle.  By  the  end  of  February,  another  new  high
has been established. Can you estimate where to look for support on the reaction?
And now we see the formation of the second Ascending Triangle (notice the relatively
low volume), which is broken on the upside in a burst of trading activity toward the
end of April. The next reaction comes back to the support of the former Tops as you
would expect.

Once again, an Ascending Triangle is formed, and you will see how the volume
dries  up  throughout  this  pattern,  coming  to  life  emphatically  on  the  breakout  on
Wednesday, June 8.

Many students, on ﬁrst seeing this chart, remark, “Well, the trend wasn’t broken
until Tuesday, June 21.” Actually, of course, no break occurred on that day. The stock
simply went ex-dividend $1.50, which, as you will see if you adjust the price by that
amount,  merely  brings  it  back  to  the  Support  at  the  top  level  of  the  April–May
Ascending Triangle.

It  is  inconceivable  that  any  such  regular  series  of  Bullish  Patterns  could  appear
throughout a full year of trading in a stock “by accident.” This is part of the normal
mechanism  of  the  market,  representing  the  judgments,  opinions,  fears,  hopes,  and
trading tactics of thousands of traders and investors. However, it should be added
that  it  is  not  often  that  one  sees  such  a  long  and  “perfect”  Major Advance  as  this.
Normally, there are interruptions, distortions, or Secondary Reactions from time to
time.

FIGURE 245.
Does it require second sight to perceive that this is a Bearish stock?
If  you  were  keeping  a  chart  on  Westinghouse  Electric  &  Manufacturing,  wouldn’t
you have recognized, long before the end of the period shown above, that the trend
was down, not up?

It is one of the great delusions of the market that the stock we own must be “good.”
As  prices  decline,  the  price–dividend  ratio,  based,  of  course,  on  past  history,  will
improve. And the price–earnings ratio likewise will look continually better. Investors
will begin to speak of “averaging their cost” by putting more money into a tumbling
stock  (instead  of  looking  for  something  that  is  going  their  way).  They  will  talk
endlessly about improved outlook, new products, a forward-looking management.
They will prove to you that it is selling “below its true value,” whatever that may
mean. They will bend every effort to establishing that what is going on before their
eyes is not true; that the very weak-looking stock is actually strong; that the American
public is making a great mistake and is misjudging this stock; that the tape is wrong
because they must be right.

But values in the market are determined democratically and, by and large, probably
represent the best composite appraisal you can ﬁnd. A move like this is not mean-
ingless, nor is it possible today to attribute it to the machinations of a few manipu-
lators. In the chart we are seeing the reﬂection of a collective evaluation which cannot
be lightly disregarded. Westinghouse reached 50

 in November 1956.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

FIGURE 246 (Continued from previous page).
This chart, in its long, mostly side-
ways movement, is a good example of the importance of making allowance for the
ex-dividend  drop  in  the  price.  During  the  ﬁrst  5  months  shown,  we  see  an  almost
perfect  Symmetrical  Triangle.  The  ﬁrst  critical  point  would  be  on  the  slight  break-
down  in  the  middle  of  May.  The  lower  border  of  the  Triangle  was  violated  just  a
triﬂe, even if we had allowed for the 62
¢ March dividend. If one had sold the stock
here,  who  could  blame  him?  And  no  great  or  immediate  harm  would  have  been
done. However, an experienced technician might have taken into account the insig-
niﬁcant  volume  at  this  point  and  waited  a  bit,  with  a  stop  at,  say,  60.  (See  the
somewhat similar situation in the chart of “LA,” Figure 233.) If “OT” had been held,
the volume pickup on the rally would have shown that the trend had not yet reversed
itself. The second critical point came in late September and early October at the time
of President Eisenhower’s illness. However, if we allow for the two dividends which
went ex in July and October, the break did not violate the May Bottom. Furthermore,
it was on relatively light volume. If the stock was still held, there was no valid reason
for  selling  on  this  decline.  From  here  on,  breaking  upward  sharply  from  the  Octo-
ber–November  Island,  “OT”  resumed  the  Major Advance  interrupted  by  this  long
period  of  Consolidation,  and  advanced  to  the  equivalent  of  over  100  (adjusted  for
two-for-one split) in 1956.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

FIGURE  247  (Continued  from  previous  page).
In  1929,  on  two  occasions,  there
were  patterns  which  began  to  show  Broadening  tendencies,  but  since  these  were
interrupted by continuation moves, about all one can say of them is that they may
have indicated a growing technical weakness in the market.

The 1957 situation, on the other hand, was very deﬁnite and was fully completed.
During the early stages of the pattern, several of our friends wrote, calling attention
to the possible Broadening Top, among them Charles E. Carden of Fort Worth, TX,
Fort Worth Star Telegram
who has handled Dow Theory comment and analysis for the 
.
The  chart  shown  in  Figure  247  is  adapted  from  one  of  Mr.  Carden’s  charts  and  is
reproduced with his permission.

The  ﬁrst  signiﬁcant  point  after  the  February  12  Bottom  was  the  Minor  Peak  of
Tuesday  May  21,  marked  (1).  The  Minor  Decline  from  this  point  on  Tuesday,  May
28 (2) was quite normal, as was the renewed advance to Monday, June 17 (3).

The ﬁrst sign of a broadening tendency was when the Average closed on Monday,
June  24  (4),  below  the  May  28  bottom.  However,  this  by  itself  did  not  indicate  a
Reversal. The advance was resumed, and surmounted the May 21 and June 17 Minor
Tops, reaching a high closing ﬁgure of 520.77 on Friday, July 12 (5). The Broadening
picture  was  now  quite  evident,  and  the  completion  of  a  Broadening  Top  required
only a close below the June 24 Bottom.

On Tuesday, August 6, the Industrial Average closed decisively below the June 24
Bottom,  signaling  the  completion  of  the  Broadening  Top.  This,  of  course,  was  an
indication of Major weakness, a warning not to be taken lightly.

The Broadening Top, as we have pointed out previously, is an indication of a wildly
gyrating market, a market without leadership or deﬁnite trend. The presumption is
that heavy distribution is going on under cover of the rallies, and the breakout move
is seldom a false one.

any

Since we are dealing, here, with an Average, rather than a single stock, we would
consider that 
 closing below point (4) after the peak at (5), regardless of how slight
the  margin  might  be,  would  constitute  a  valid  breakout,  since  Averages  are  less
sensitive than individual stocks, and it is customary to consider even slight penetra-
tions  at  signal  points  (as  in  Dow  Theory)  as  perfectly  satisfactory.  You  will  notice
also  that,  although  it  would  be  possible  to  draw  the  Broadening  Top  through  the
extreme  ranges  of  the  price,  as  we  have  done  with  the  wide-dashed  line,  we  have
used  the  closing  prices  as  marked  by  the  narrow-dashed  line.  This,  too,  is  in  line
with Dow Theory practice, where only closing prices are considered.

The implication of the pattern here was Bearish for the “market-as-a-whole.” As
might be expected, a majority of stocks showed weak patterns of trends at this time.
However, as always, it was necessary to examine each stock separately on its merits,
since, as we will show in the following pages, not all stocks behaved alike even in
this extremely weak market situation.

1957  Bearish  Trend  in  Industrial  Rayon.  At  no  time  did  this  stock

Averages do not tell the whole story. Each stock has to be considered on its own
merits.  Long  before  the  formation  of  the  1957  Broadening  Top  in  the  Industrial
Average, Industrial Rayon was moving down in a Major Decline. You will ﬁnd many
cases  where  it  is  difﬁcult  to  “see”  what  a  stock  is  doing,  or  to  determine  its  Major
Trend. But in such a situation as this (and this is not a rare case), it is perfectly obvious
that the trend is down. Although there were a number of Minor Rallies and Consol-
idations  during  the  decline,  the  entire  pattern  was  so  obviously  part  and  parcel  of
the same big decline that no one who was even slightly familiar with typical stock
behavior would have been tempted to buy the stock, even to cover shorts.

On Monday, July 29, there was a sharp downward break with a gap on climactic
volume. This would have suggested the probability of a Minor Bottom, and for three
and a half weeks, the stock did stabilize at around 24. But even during this Consol-
idation, the continuing weakness showed up on the small Descending Triangle that
was  formed,  and  ultimately  on  Wednesday, August  21,  the  price  broke  sharply  to
continue the Major Decline.

FIGURE  249.
1957  Bullish  Trend  in  Lorillard.  Although  most  stocks  declined  in
1957, there were a number of strong issues like this one which appeared to be totally
unaffected by the general pessimism.

Averages do not tell the whole story. It will come as a shock to many readers, who
rightly regard the latter half of 1957 as a Major Bear Market, to see Lorillard making
a typical Bull Market Advance. Lorillard moved up from 15
 to 34 during the year —
and reached 54
 during the ﬁrst 3 months of 1958. It is hard to believe that this chart
and the Industrial Rayon chart we just looked at cover the same period, that is, the
year 1957.

⅝

The majority of stocks did suffer severe depreciation. But there were a good many
issues  which,  like  Lorillard,  enjoyed  a  generally  Bullish  Trend  all  year. Among  the
important stocks that moved up consistently in 1957 were American Chicle, Anchor
Hocking Glass, Colgate-Palmolive, General Foods, General Cigar, Grand Union, Na-
tional Biscuit, Parke Davis, Penick & Ford, Plough, Inc., Proctor & Gamble, Ruberoid,
Vick Chemical, Winn-Dixie Stores, and Zenith Radio.

Whatever  theories  we  may  have  as  to  the  condition  of  the  “market-as-a-whole,”
(EN: Unless
we must always realize that we are buying and selling individual stocks. 
we are trading Index Shares
 We may get a picture of extreme Bullishness or extreme
Bearishness in the “general market,” but if this picture conﬂicts with the clear evi-
dence in a particular stock, we must recognize that it is the stock, not the Average,
that we have to deal with. We cannot assume that a stock “must” follow the Average.
And it is often possible to obtain greater stability and safety by buying a few strong
stocks in a Bear Market or by selling short a few weak stocks in a Bull Market, than
by attempting to maximize proﬁts with an “all-out” position one way or the other.

During the latter 9 months of 1961, some well-known market Aver-
ages  continued  to  show  new  all-time  highs.  However,  the  Evaluative  Index  (see
Chapter 38), in this period did not indicate any such overall strength; many stocks
were in almost continuous decline for the 9 months. These included such important
issues as Air Reduction, Allied Chemical, Allis-Chalmers, Aluminum, Ltd., Fansteel
Metallurgical,  Flintkote,  Heyden  Newport  Chemical,  Sperry  Rand,  Texas  Instru-
ments, Trans World Airlines, Universal Match, and many others. At such times it is
best to choose stocks selectively and maintain adequate liquid reserves.

FIGURE 251.
A familiar Top Pattern. From the end of 1957 to the spring of 1961,
Burndy  Corporation  moved  from  below  10  to  37  in  a  generally  Bullish  Trend.  The
advance  accelerated  sharply  on  the  post-election  rally  of  late  1960  and  early  1961.
But with Burndy, as with many other stocks, the rally ended in the early months of
1961. Here, we have not only a perfect example of the Head-and-Shoulders Top in
the price action, but we have the typical volume conﬁrmation. The early April rally
was on heavy volume. The rally in the last week of April was on somewhat disap-
pointing  volume,  although  a  new  high  was  made  at  that  time.  We  have  a  deﬁnite
increase  of  volume  on  the  retreat  from  this  peak,  and  practically  no  enthusiasm  in
the ﬁnal rally of the ﬁrst week of June. The breakdown on Monday, June 19, accom-
panied by heavier volume and a deﬁnite gap in the price track, conﬁrmed the Top
Formation. Although Burndy held around the 30 level for a time, and after a further
drop  recovered  to  31,  the  Major  Trend  had  deﬁnitely  been  reversed.  By  June  1962
Burndy was selling at 11

“The Same Old Patterns”

FIGURE 252.
Weekly chart of Brunswick Corporation showing the ﬁnal stages of
the long Bull Market in “BC,” the Climactic Top in March 1961, the distributive phase
through December 1961, and the ultimate breakdown.

For 5 years, from 1956 into early 1961, Brunswick advanced in a great Bull Market
surge. During this period, the stock was split four times. In the ﬁrst week of March
1961,  terminating  the  post-election  rally,  “BC”  made  a  new  high  on  extraordinary
volume,  but  closed  the  week  nearly  at  the  bottom  of  the  weekly  range.  The  One-
Week Reversal might well have served as a warning to the market trader.

However, assuming that the owner of shares in Brunswick was not a trader, and
was interested in the stock from a long-term point of view, he might have held the
stock through the breakdown from the Symmetrical Triangle formed in March and
early April.  He  might  have  continued  to  keep  his  shares  through  the  summer  and
fall of 1961 and the rally of September and October. If so, and if he had been watching
the action of the stock, he would realize that the 50–52 level was a critical area. That
a break through this previous Bottom would represent a serious failure of Support.
And certainly, the decisive violation of the 50 level in the ﬁrst week of January 1962
(with heavy volume) could be recognized as a very dangerous Reversal Signal, calling
for  immediate  sale  of  the  stock  regardless  of  capital  gains  tax  or  anything  else.
Although this move preceded the general collapse of the market by several months,
it was a clear technical indication of extreme weakness and extreme danger in Brun-
swick, regardless of the action of other stocks at that time. If an investor had noted
the break but decided to “wait for a rally” to sell his stock, he would have had no
chance to get out. Brunswick never recovered, never rallied, and by October 1962 it
was selling at 17.

FIGURE  253.
A  beautiful  example  of  a  Rectangle  in  Polaroid.  Notice  the  low-
volume ﬂuctuations between (approximately) 178 and 202. On Thursday, May 10, on
the highest volume of that year to date, Polaroid broke Support and plunged to 168.
This was a clearly Bearish Move. It would have been fatal to “hold for a rally,” for
there was no rally. It can be very expensive to hold onto a stock wishfully when the
situation has changed radically, no matter how good it may have looked previously.
Note that this break came more than 2 weeks before the “near-panic” of May 28. By
that time, “PRD” had dropped 50 points and was headed for still lower levels.

FIGURE 254.
At a time when a majority of stocks were already showing signs of
serious  weakness,  early  in  1962,  Copper  Range  was  making  vigorous  new  highs.
Actually, the move did not get far; it never substantially broke above the 1961 Top.
The evidence of weakness in “CPX” did not become apparent until, after the relatively
¾
weak April rally, the stock broke through 19 on Monday, April 30, and closed at 17
.
This was, of course, the completion of a well-marked Head-and- Shoulders Top. In
this case, there were 3 days of rally before the downward move really got under way,
but it might have been dangerous to count on a rally after the clearly Bearish signal.
Incidentally, this Top Formation was completed well before the precipitous drop

of May and June.

FIGURE 255.
Like practically all stocks, “W” went into a tailspin in the spring of
1962.  After  the  “bad  day,”  May  28,  it  continued  to  slide  throughout  the  month  of
June. At this point, there started what could be considered no more than a technical
rally in a Bear Market. This rally stopped at 29 and was followed by a dull decline
lasting about 2 weeks.

The next move, in the second week of August, was marked by considerable volume,
and while there was no obvious, clear-cut pattern, it seemed signiﬁcant that the 29
level, brieﬂy touched on May 23, May 28, and July 12, was penetrated on August 6.
Whether to regard this August 6 closing as an immediate buy signal, or to wait for
the completion of the breakout move and look for an opportunity to buy on a reaction,
would  be  a  problem.  In  this  case,  it  would  have  paid  to  wait.  Notice  that  the  late
August reaction came back to the 29 level where it found Support, and then continued
its upward move.

Considering  the  weakness  of  most  stocks  in  this  period,  the  action  of  “W”  is
remarkable. The important thing to recognize here is that individual stocks do not
necessarily follow “the main trend” of the Averages.

Weekly, July 1961 through June 1962. This chart shows the Head-and-
Shoulders Top Formation in the Industrial Average which preceded the collapse of
April, May, and June 1962. Normally, and especially in the charts of individual stocks,
there  would  tend  to  be  heavier  volume  on  the  left  shoulder.  However,  the  price
pattern  alone  is  sufﬁcient  to  mark  the  pattern  as  a  dangerously  toppy  situation.
During the entire period in which this formation took shape, many individual stocks
representing important companies were showing Top Reversal symptoms, as might
be expected. Note that so far as this Head-and-Shoulders Pattern is concerned, the
Reversal Signal is not deﬁnite until the neckline has been penetrated.

Daily, April through September 1961. Here is a rather confusing and
complicated  chart,  but  one  which  contains  several  points  of  interest  worth  a  bit  of
analysis. Notice the beautiful little Head-and-Shoulders Top in April and May, espe-
cially the volume weakness on the ﬁnal rally before the downside breakout. Notice
also that this stock was split 2-for-1 in June, but that such a split does not materially
affect the technical action of the stock, except that since there are now two shares of
stock (at half the market value) for each share of old stock, there may be some increase
in the average number of shares traded per day. Notice also that once the downtrend
was  established,  the  rallies  (especially  the  mid-July  rally)  do  not  penetrate  the
trendline drawn through the April and May peaks. This trend continued down for
over a year after this, reaching a low of 11

 in October 1962.

Daily, January through June 1963. Here is a good example of a Sym-
metrical Triangle as a Continuation Pattern. Triangles of this (Symmetrical) type may
mark Consolidations in a Major Trend, or may constitute a Reversal Formation. The
characteristics  in  either  case  are  an  active  move  to  the  ﬁrst  turning  point  of  the
Triangle, and then, generally diminishing volume as the price ﬂuctuates in a narrow-
ing pattern. During this period, it could be said that the stock was in 
 an uptrend,
marked by the lower boundary of the formation, and a downtrend, indicated by the
upper boundary. Notice the increase of volume on the breakout, which, in this case,
was  on  the  upside.  Also  notice  the  reaction  to  the  “cradle  point”  deﬁned  by  the
intersection  of  the  two  boundary  trends  of  the  Triangle.  The  advance  of  the  stock
from April to June measures just a little more than the height of the open side of the
Triangle. The attainment of this “objective” does not necessarily mean the termination
of the Major Trend, however, and by August 1963 Cerro had reached 33

Daily,  March  through  August  1963.  Here  is  a  good  example  of  an
Ascending Triangle, in which the rallies advance repeatedly to a given level, and the
reactions ﬁnd Support at gradually higher points. Such a pattern normally indicates
a potentially Bullish situation in the making, just as the reverse (Descending Triangle)
implies a Bearish tendency. Notice the higher volume on the various peaks near 22,
and the very high volume on the breakout move in August. If any further evidence
of the strength of this move was needed, the Breakaway Gap at the opening, Monday,
August 12, would supply it. After a breakout of this sort, it would be quite normal
for the stock to suffer some proﬁt-taking reaction, usually on light volume, and such
a  reaction  might  run  back  to  22  or  even  a  little  below  this  without  altering  the
essentially Bullish nature of this picture.

FIGURE 260.
Daily, June through November 1962. Before commenting on the No-
vember  breakout  here,  we  should  call  attention  to  the  fact  that  “SOC”  was  one  of
the stocks that held up fairly well during the Cuban crisis in October 1961, and did
not  make  a  new  low  under  the  June  bottoms.  This  chart  picture  is  an  excellent
example of a Double Bottom. It is not necessary that the two Bottoms be at exactly
the same level if they are reasonably close. The important thing is that the stock has
found Support once, has rallied, then declined again, and has found Support at nearly
the same point. The Bottoms should be some distance apart; there should be at least
6  weeks  between  them,  preferably  more.  Also,  the  rally  between  them  should  be
deﬁnite  and  should  amount  to  at  least  a  15%  gain  at  its  peak.  The  formation  does
not  acquire  signiﬁcance  as  a  Major  Bottom  Pattern  until  the  level  of  the  top  of  the
rally  is  penetrated  on  substantial  volume.  This  penetration  took  place  on  Tuesday,
November 13, and from that time continued in a Major Bullish Trend, reaching 1559
in May 1963, an advance of over 500 points from the close on the day of breakout.
Double Tops have an opposite signiﬁcance; they are similar to the Double Bottoms,
but consist of two tops at approximately the same level, separated by some weeks
or months, and with a decline between them, which must be penetrated to validate
the Top Formation.

Daily, November 1962 to April 1963. To the average person, unfamiliar
with the usual behavior of stocks in the market, the price ﬂuctuations appear mean-
ingless and entirely fortuitous. If they are aware of general trends lasting months or
years, they are often inclined to consider only the trend of “the Averages,” and are
not conscious of the fact that many stocks may be making large advances at the very
same time that others are sliding lower and lower. It is not always possible to lay a
straight  edge  ruler  along  the  trend  and  show  that  it  makes  a  perfect  straight  line
(though this does sometimes happen) but, as in the case of General Steel Industries,
there  is  no  question  but  that  the  advance  is  fairly  consistent  over  a  long  period  of
time,  barring  the  relatively  unimportant  reactions,  Consolidations,  etc.,  along  the
way. You will notice, too, that the two-for-one split in early March did not materially
affect the upward trend except to show somewhat more volume, as might be expected
with a greater number of (new) shares. For a contrasting (downside) trend, see the
chart of Avnet Electronics, Figure 250.

Daily, February to August 1963. This is an interesting study of Support
and Resistance phenomena. Incidentally, it is also an example of a Bearish Stock (and
not the only one by any means) in what was generally considered a Bullish Market,
during the spring and summer of 1963. We would point out several rallies to 31 in
March and April, and the breakdown in early May. In May and June, the stock rallied,
but stalled at about the level of the March low. Then there was another drop, and in
the rally this time came back to the late April low. The next drop, in July, was followed
by  a  little  rally  to  the  June  Bottom  at  25.  This  is  fairly  typical  Support–Resistance
behavior. The price level which has been a support tends to become a resistance once
the support has been substantially broken. Vice versa, as regards overhead Resistance;
after it has been broken, it tends to serve as a support level.

January  through  June  1963.  Sometimes  a  move  happens  all  of  a
sudden and does not result in a continuing long trend. In this case, it is not possible
to say whether the long-term trend will be up or not. The purpose of showing this
chart is to point up the remarkable action that can follow a break through an impor-
tant  Support  or  Resistance  Level.  You  will  notice  that  the  entire  period  from  mid-
January to Tuesday, May 14, can be regarded as a Rectangle on the chart, with Bottoms
at about 10
. Notice the increase of activity on the
several rallies during the formation. The move, which was a “situational” thing in
sugars, affected all sugars in May, and turned out to be somewhat of a ﬂash in the
pan.  Nevertheless,  it  was  a  spectacular  one,  and  a  trader  with  courage  and  acuity
might have picked up this stock as a speculation after the close of Tuesday, May 14.
The  next  5  trading  days  advanced  the  price  from  Wednesday’s  opening  at  12  to
Tuesday, May 21, close at 17
, an advance of 46%. This is a type of market trading
we  would  not  recommend  generally;  it  calls  for  courage,  experience,  and  the  will-
ingness  to  take  a  number  of  small  losses  in  order  to  secure  one  substantial  gain.
However, the in-and-out trader, who observed the action on May 21 and noticed the
One-Day Reversal with abnormal volume and a gap, could have secured maximum
quick proﬁts either by selling his stock at the opening of the next day, or by placing
a stop-loss order just under the close, say at 17

There are some warning signs in “CDA” in the Minor Breakdowns
of late March and early May. What seems especially signiﬁcant, though, is the nature
of the recovery move in May and early June 1965. The two convergent boundaries
of the Recovery Trend form an up-sloping Wedge, which has rather deﬁnite Bearish
implications.  If  the  Wedge  had  been  pointed  down,  it  would  strongly  suggest  the
possibility of a decisive upward breakout. Notice that on the 2 days when the highest
prices were attained during this Wedge Pattern, the stock closed near the Bottom of
the day’s range. The subsequent history here, the collapse on heavy volume, shows
clearly how dramatic a break from this not-too-common formation can be.

Here  is  a  chart  that  shows  several  interesting  technical  features.  In
July, August, and most of September, “W” was in a period of dormancy. The breakout
of September 27 was followed by a week of inaction, and then a strong continuation
of  the  move  on  big  volume.  Notice  the  October–November  Consolidation,  which
took  the  form  of  a  large  Symmetrical  Triangle.  If  we  draw  the  upper  boundary  of
this Triangle, and the lower, we see that the breakout signaling a continuation of the
move, on Wednesday, December 1, was decisive both in price and volume action. At
no time during the advance from 28
 to over 62 was there any indication of potential
weakness.

The weekly chart of Livingston Oil from January 1965 into January
1966 is a good example of a Major Bottom. Just how weak the stock was during the
early months of 1965 can be judged by the clear Downside Gap during the month
of May. Also, you will notice that the volume on this whole headlong collapse was
rather heavy. However, from July to the middle of October, the trading activity “dried
up,” and the stock ﬂuctuated in narrower and narrower swings, forming a Symmet-
rical Triangle. The pickup of volume on the October breakout was spectacular, and
an observant investor would have had a “second chance” to buy on the reaction in
the ﬁrst week of November, when the stock drifted back to the top of the Triangle.

Here is a beautiful picture of technical market action in Packard–Bell
Electronics from August 1965 into January 1966. The ﬁrst point of interest is the Flag
Consolidation in September and October, a classic example (“The Flag ﬂies at half-
mast”)  and  on  the  resumption  of  the  up-move,  the  stock  did  duplicate  the  earlier
move,  and  a  bit  more.  (Compare  with  the  1945  chart  of  Martin–Parry,  Figure  223.)
Notice  the  nearly  ﬂat  Tops  and  the  rising  Bottoms  from  October  to  January,  with
generally declining volume (Ascending Triangle), and the magniﬁcent breakout move
in the second week of January 1966. In this case, we can see no evidence calling for
selling the stock all the way from September into January.

“The Same Old Patterns”

559

FIGURE 269.
A complete collapse in one day, Astrodata in January 1970. Not the
sort of action you see every day, or every month. But it is “normal” in the sense that
it is a phenomenon we have seen many times in the past and which will undoubtedly
be seen many times in years to come. When it does happen, it should be heeded. It
means trouble. “ADA” was doing well in what appeared to be a typical and perfectly
healthy uptrend. After a one-day suspension on January 15, it reopened many points
lower and never recovered. Trading was halted in late September. Some readers may
remember other downside moves of this nature in the past. In Mack Trucks, in Fifth
Avenue  Coach,  and  some  may  even  recall,  many  years  ago,  a  break  like  this  in
American Woolen. Such a break is, of course, due to some sudden development or
change in company affairs; but it is not necessary “to know the reasons”; the chart
speaks for itself. As Lady Macbeth put it (in another connection), “Stand not upon
the order of your going, but go at once.” There was a good example of this type of
a “Gap Move” in Villager Industries on April 30, 1971, when the stock dropped 42%,
from 7
 in one day. Such moves as we are discussing here are nearly always
on the downside; we do not often see comparable upside gap moves. And after this
type of break, although there may be brief rallies, the stock nearly always resumes
the  downtrend,  and  in  many  cases,  is  delisted  from  the  Exchange. Anyone  caught
holding  such  a  stock  should  not  feel  that  he  had  made  a  mistake  in  buying  it,  nor
should  he  look  for  evidence  of  weakness  before  the  big  breakdown,  for  ordinarily,
there is none. But he should get out immediately to avoid further loss. And by way
of reassurance, it can be repeated that this kind of collapse is a rather rare occurrence.

FIGURE 269.1.
Lest one think that the air pocket gap does not still exist, here is an
example  from  the  turn  of  the  century  (third  millennium).  These  gaps,  caused  by
disappointing earnings, were so prevalent at the end of the century at the top of that
Bull Market, that one could short vulnerable stocks before earnings reports with little
upside risk and often collect nice scalps like this one.

FIGURE 270 (Figure appears on facing page).
A typical electric and gas utility stock.
There are a great many stocks in this group, serving various municipalities or regions.
They tend to show similar market behavior because they are basically similar in nature.
There is, of course, a relation between the earnings of a company and the dividends
paid, and the market price of the shares. However, neither earnings nor dividends
alone are sufﬁcient to constitute a complete determination of “value,” since there are
many other factors that can affect the “value” considered from different angles, such
as dependability of earnings, future prospects, taxability, research and development
investment by the company, and so forth.

The electric and gas companies, enjoying a regulated monopoly position in most
communities, have a sure and steady income; and they are also in a deﬁnite “growth”
situation  because  of  the  constantly  increasing  demands  for  power  by  users.  Most
utilities will show a record and pattern of trading over a period of years very similar
to that of “PEG.” You will notice that reported earnings have been larger each year
from 1959 through 1970. Also, the dividend rate has been increased each year except
in 1970, when it was unchanged from the year before. Anyone basing his estimate
of “value” on a simple index such as “price–earnings ratio” would conclude that the
 times as good a buy in 1970 as it had been in early 1965.
stock was 2
Obviously, there is more to it than that. The big funds and other large holders of
stock  are  not  giving  up  “bargains”  of  that  sort  lightly  and  for  no  reason.  The  de-
pressed chart is undoubtedly reﬂecting the whole thorny outlook facing the utility
industry,  including  costly  new  facilities,  antipollution  devices,  and  other  problems
including deregulation.

FIGURE  272. From  a  1967  high  of  48½,  “FLY”  started  a  downtrend  that  lasted
2 years and took the stock down to 11¼. But during the spring and summer of 1970,
the  stock  found  bottom,  made  a  Head-and-Shoulders  Reversal,  and  took  off  in  a
skyrocket move that, by February 1971, had recovered nearly all of the 2-year drop.

FIGURE 273. Here is a familiar pattern you have seen many times before in the pages
of this book or in your own charts. Here we see a large Ascending Triangle in the daily
chart of Action Industries, formed in December of 1971 and January of 1972. Notice the
typical breakout and reaction moves and the continued uptrend into April of 1972.

FIGURE 273.2. The beneﬁts of the “Wintel” partnership are reﬂected in Intel’s chart.
The  trader  might  have  been  in  and  out  of  Intel  several  times  based  on  tightening
trendlines, while the long-term investor would have patiently waited out the — call
it a “rectangular wedge” — which never was violated on the downside. The steeper
the trendline the more likely — even the more certainly — it will be broken.

FIGURE  273.4. AMD.  Reﬂecting  the  vagaries  of  the  semiconductor  business,  in-
cluding the felicity of being a competitor of Intel, AMD shows trading opportunities
both up and down. Here the intermediate-term trader would respond to the vigorous
breaking of short-term downtrend lines to get long.

FIGURE 273.5.1. Any resemblance between this chart and Amazon, (Figure 205.7.2)
is not strictly coincidental. Readers will remember Magee’s principle that birds of a
feather ﬂock together. Internet goony birds certainly do, or did. Yahoo looks in this
guise somewhat stronger than Amazon, but then selling books and mortar is a harder
row  to  hoe  than  selling  electronic  images  (best  business  in  the  world). And  again
such an attractive fundamental story. Gooks (or geeks) on skates helping revolution-
ize the wild frontier. We love these stories. But not enough to stop drawing lines on
the chart and selling them when the violate our lines. Even love must obey the rule
of the ruler.

FIGURE  274. The  ﬁle  of  press  clippings  predicting  the  death  of Apple  weighs  as
much as the daily output of the Augean Stables. And is worth as much. One wonders
why  the  press  likes  to  beat  on  Apple  so.  Especially  when  the  wizard  is  up  to  his
never ending tricks. And when the wizard, (Steve Jobs) has millions of fanatics ready
to support his next trick. And, although the Beatles are mad at Jobs and Apple, Apple
is  now  a  music  company  as  well  as  a  computer  company.  The  smooth  as  silicon
lubricant iPod made music to investor’s ears and Apple took off on another run. The
start of the latest trick is pictured here. The volume in April is the wake up call. And
of  course,  what  is  that  volume?  A  shakeout.  The  breakout  across  the  descending
triangle line after the false signal (Remember? Those false signals are often followed
by  valid  signals)  the  volume  and  the  surging  run  days  —  all  good  grist  for  the
analyst’s mill. Furthermore the surge across the downtrend line on big volume should
be recognized as an important technical pattern regardless of what proceeds it.

chapter thirty-eight

Balanced and Diversiﬁed

The average investor wants a clear-cut, simple, easy answer to his question,
“What do you think of the market?” To him, it must be at all times either a
Bull  Market  or  a  Bear  Market.  If,  in  answer  to  his  insistent  demand,  you
reply with the question, “What particular stocks are you interested in?,” he
will avoid that issue and say, Oh, I mean in 

general
.

And  if  you  will  examine  the  pages  of  any  magazine  or  newspaper
carrying a great deal of ﬁnancial advertising, you will ﬁnd that many advis-
ers and advisory services make a great point of giving unhedged opinions
as to the future course of the market, and these opinions are most frequently
couched in terms of what the market as a whole is going to do.

deﬁnitions

Now, there is just enough truth in the common belief that they all move
together, to make this an exceedingly dangerous assumption. It is true, for
  of  what  we  feel  constitutes  a  Bull
example,  that  we  can  set  up 
Market  or  a  Bear  Market,  such  as  the  Dow  Theory,  and  if  a  given  set  of
conditions meets the rules we have laid down (our deﬁnitions, that is), then
we can say accurately, “according to my premises this is now a Bull Market”
(or a Bear Market, as the case may be). It is also true that over the years, if
  it  were  a  stock,  and  had

It is also true that in the great inﬂationary and deﬂationary movements,
which reﬂect the changes in the relative values of dollars to equities, there
is a tendency for the majority of stocks to move with the tide.

And  it  is  furthermore  true  that  in  the  day-to-day  movement  of  stock

prices, it appears that most stocks move up or move down together.

But we should never lose sight of the fact that the Averages themselves
are abstractions, not railroads, manufacturing companies, airlines, etc. If the
Averages move, it is because the individual stocks making up the Averages
have moved. And while it is true that during a time when the Averages are
advancing,  a  majority  of  stocks  are  also  advancing,  it  is  not  quite  possible

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

the fact that a stock has not advanced, but has declined in a Bull Market, is
considered sufﬁcient to make the stock attractive for purchase on the basis
that it must catch up with the others.

If  we  examine  the  facts,  that  is,  the  long-term  records  of  what  stocks
have actually done, we ﬁnd that there are periods when most stocks go up
in value and other times when most of them go down. We ﬁnd, sometimes,
that laggard stocks will eventually join the procession in an upward trend.
But this does not always happen. And it can be extremely uncomfortable
to  have  bought  stocks  in  a  presumably  Bullish  Market,  because  they  are
behind the market, or because they are all going to go up, and then wait for
months  as  we  watch  other  stocks  climbing  to  new  highs  while  our  own
securities continue to languish or decline further.

From what you already know of the market you will surely agree that
it is not a wise policy to put all your capital into buying stocks in what is
clearly a Bear Market in the Averages and in most stocks. And you will agree,
too, that it is not a safe thing to sell stocks short to the limit of your resources
in a skyrocketing Bull Market.

If you have to be 100% on one side or the other, it is much better to go
with the trend. In that way, you will be in line with the probabilities as shown
by a majority of stocks, and by the Averages.

But you should realize that going with the trend is not always as easy
as it sounds. We can set up deﬁnitions, as we have, of what constitutes the
Major  Trend.  Then  the  question  is  whether  you  have  the  patience  and  the
courage to maintain a position in line with these deﬁnitions through months
of uncertainty and possible adverse moves. During turning periods it is often
hard to make the decision to buy or sell.

And most especially, there is the difﬁculty of knowing what to buy or

what to sell, and when.

The  simple  patterns  and  signals  of  the Averages  do  not  tell  the  whole
story.  There  is  a  certain  usefulness  in  regarding  the  market  as  a  whole  in
studying Dow Theory, just so long as we keep in mind that the Averages we
are  studying  are  generalities  (high-order  abstractions),  and  the  rules  for
determining  their  trend  apply  to  these  generalities  and  not  necessarily  to
each and every stock listed on the Stock Exchange. 

In many cases, for example, a group of stocks will top out and start an
important Bearish Trend while other groups of stocks are continuing to make
new  highs.  This  occurred  in  1946,  when  we  saw  a  large  number  of  stocks
topping out in January and February, and others continuing strong until the
end of May.

We think of 1929 as the year the market made its great peak, and crashed
in  October  to  start  the  series  of  breaks  that  continued  into  1932.  There  is
some truth in this; but it is not the whole truth. There were some important
stocks that made their highs long before the 1929 Top. Chrysler, for example,
made  its  high  in  October  1928,  and  had  dropped  from  140  to  60 
  the
Panic of 1929. There were stocks which never enjoyed a Bull Market at all
in the whole period from 1924 to 1929. By actual count of nearly 700 listed

stocks, 262 issues made their Bull Market highs before 1929, 181 topped in
1929,  but  before August  of  that  year.  There  were  several  stocks  which  did
not have their ﬁrst downside break until after 1929. Forty-four stocks went
into new Bull Market high ground after 1929 and before mid-1932. Only 184
of the 676 stocks studied made their Bull Market highs in August, September,
or October of 1929 and crashed in October and November.

In other words, only 27% of the stocks acted the way everybody knows

EN: As the Dow and S&P 500 made all-time highs in 1999 and
were near those highs in 2000, the same condition held true again. Many stocks had
topped and were in long downtrends. EN9: And as stocks crashed after the top of
March 2000 Dow stocks held up well compared to NASDAQ stocks and the S&P
500, which saw declines of around 50%. See Figure 203.3.

It  is  all  right  to  accept  the  general  trend  as  a  useful  device,  so  long  as
we know it is a device only, and not a picture of the detailed reality. We have
to face the problem which continually confronts every student of the market:
How  to  protect  ourselves  from  uncertainties  in  interpretation  of  the Aver-
ages, and how to protect ourselves against stocks which are not moving with
the majority.

The  problem  can  be  met,  ﬁrst  of  all,  by  not  taking  an  unreasonable

amount of risk at any time (see Chapter 41).

It  can  also  be  met  by  using  an  Evaluative  Index  instead  of  switching
from all-out Bullish to all-out Bearish. By this we mean using an indicator
that will show not merely whether it is a Bull Market or a Bear Market, but
how Bullish or how Bearish it seems at a given time.

At ﬁrst glance, this may seem not too different a conception from that
of  classic  Dow  Theory.  The  same  technical  methods  apply. Also,  during  a
strongly  Bullish  Market,  an  Evaluative  Index  will  also  indicate  approxi-
 of strength. As the market begins to develop weak spots,

Before  considering  the  use  of  this  Index,  let  us  outline  what  it  is  and
how  it  may  be  constructed.  You  will  understand  it  is  not  a  precise  tool;  it
gives  only  an  approximate  picture  of  the  state  of  the  market;  it  gives  no
positive signals; and, in the ﬁnal analysis, it is a reﬂection of the judgment
and opinion of the person who is maintaining it.

Suppose you are keeping daily charts of 100 stocks. At the end of each
week, you can mark these along the bottom of the chart with a small plus
or  minus,  indicating  your  opinion  as  to  whether  each  particular  stock  is
moving in a Bullish Major Trend, or is Bearish. In some cases, you will ﬁnd
it hard to make a decision. This is not too important, however, since these
cases will not be numerous, and in the majority of stocks, you will normally
be able to mark them plus or minus on the basis of their obvious action. If
you now total the plus stocks and also the minus stocks, including those in
which you have had to make a tentative decision, you will have two ﬁgures
totaling the number of your charts. If 75 of these are plus, you can say that
the market looks 75% Bullish to you. If next week the percentage is higher,

say 80%, it indicates a stronger or more Bullish condition. If it is lower, say
70%, it shows that, on balance, there are fewer of your stocks that look strong,
hence the market is presumably weaker.

As we have said before, if the Averages are making new highs, you will
expect (and ﬁnd) that the Evaluative Index will range well above 50%. In an
obvious Bear Market, the Index will stand considerably lower than 50%.

But  notice  that  we  do  not  speak,  here,  of  signals.  There  is  no  point  at
which we need to say, “Sell everything.” Neither is there a point at which
we can say, “Buy now,” in an all-out sense. The Index will ﬂoat and adjust
itself continually to the shifting conditions.

It  must  be  clear  that  a  market  in  which  only  53%  of  a  large  group  of
representative stocks are moving Bullishly is not as strong as one in which
80% of these stocks are acting Bullish.

Therefore, you would be justiﬁed in making larger commitments on the

long side in this second case.

You would still have the problem of 

 of the individual stocks to
buy. But you would be justiﬁed in making larger total commitments, or in
assuming total greater risk (see again Chapter 41), than in a market that was
barely qualifying as a Bull Market.

selection

By  bringing  the  total  of  one’s  investment  program  into  line  with  this
Index, it is possible to roll with the punch; and one would almost automat-
ically be withdrawn from a deteriorating market before things became too
dangerous. Furthermore, this would be accomplished without the need for
torturing decisions as to whether to sell now or wait a while.

There is a further extension of this method. If an investor were to follow
the Evaluative Index only by increasing or decreasing his long commitments
with the rise and fall of the Index, he might be better off than if he had only
the  two  alternatives  of  complete  optimism  or  complete  pessimism.  But  in
this case, he would still be pointed always in one direction, and would stand
to lose to some degree on his long commitments if the market did eventually
reverse and go into a Panic Move.

The extension of the method is to proportion capital, or a certain portion
of capital, between the long side and the short side of the market. Assuming
that your interpretation of your own charts is reasonably correct in a majority
of cases, you can, at any particular time, select several stronger-than-average
stocks, and similarly, several weaker-than-average issues.

With  the  Index  standing  in  the  vicinity  of  50%  (as  it  did  for  a  number
of months in mid-1956), you can then select several strong stocks to buy, and
several  candidates  for  short  sale,  making  commitments  that  will  approxi-
mately balance your total risk. In the case of an upward surge that sweeps
all  before  it,  you  will,  of  course,  accrue  losses  on  the  short  sales,  and  may
eventually  have  to  reverse  your  classiﬁcation  of  them  from  minus  to  plus,
closing them out for a loss. But in such a case, the gains on your good long
positions  will  more  than  offset  the  loss,  assuming  your  choices  were  well
made; and the loss realized can be absorbed as insurance, the price you have
paid to be in a protected position.

On the other hand, should the market collapse suddenly (as it did, for
(EN: and as
example, at the time of President Eisenhower’s illness in 1955) 
it did on rumors of Reagan’s incompetence in October 1987, and the Aisian Flu of
1998,  etc.,  etc....)
,  the  accrual  of  loss  in  the  long  positions  will  be  offset  by
accrual of gains in the short positions. And if the decline should continue to
a point calling for sale of the long stock, the losses here could be considered
the  price  of  the  insurance  protection  to  the  shorts  provided  by  the  longs.
EN: In the tradition of the Texas Hedge, I take a somewhat different view of shorts.
While they would be viewed in Pragmatic Portfolio Theory as reducing risk, I like
to view shorts as another proﬁt opportunity with the added beneﬁt of reducing total
risk. Of course, being short a stock in a conﬁrmed Uptrend is simply feckless. And
vice versa.

It  is  also  quite  possible,  in  a  more  normal  market,  that  both  the  long

positions and the short positions will show gains.

What  we  are  proposing  is  a  systematic  and  continuous  arbitrage  or
hedge. As the Evaluative Index advances, the proportion of short positions
would gradually be reduced, and the long positions increased. As the Index
(EN9:  I  have  suggested  that  the  method
declines,  the  reverse  would  happen. 
outlined here be called a “Natural Hedge,” and the implementation of the hedge be
called  Rhythmic  Trading.  A  Natural  Hedge  of  the  Dow  would  consist  of  a  long
commitment to, for example, the DIA in a bull market and short positions in bear
stocks within the Dow. Or, even better, short positions in stocks positively correlated
to the weak Dow stocks. This last because even weak members of the Dow will tend
to be cushioned by the large holdings of passive indexers.) 

This method is essentially conservative. Those who have always feared
the  short  sale  as  a  purely  speculative  gamble  might  well  reexamine  short
selling from the standpoint of using the short sale as a regular part of their
investment program as counterbalance to the long holdings.

The result to be looked for in this conservative balanced and diversiﬁed
program is primarily protection of capital. By its very nature, it eliminates
the possibility of plunging for spectacular proﬁts.

But it also provides the mechanism by which the technical method can
stand on its merits, largely independent of the changes and chances of the
market.  It  makes  it  possible  to  eliminate  a  large  part  of  the  anxiety  and
uncertainty  that  so  many  traders  and  investors  carry  every  day  and  often
late into the night.

strongly for itself:

June low of 8% Strong, the MEI headed steadily higher, giving an Aggressive
Buy signal throughout late June and July.

EN: Now  Diagram  10.1

The June 1984 MEI low of 8% Strong, together with the 8% level reached
on February 25, 1984, constituted a Double Bottom oversold reading for this
index. It corresponded to the 1079 Bottom recorded by the Dow–Jones Indus-
trial Average on June 18, 1984, after which that index advanced steadily to
its recent July peak of 1372.

For  over  20  years,  all  major  stock  market  Bottoms  have  corresponded
with extremely low MEI readings. During the “turbulent period” when the
stock market oscillated violently but showed no gain at all, MEI readings of
5% Strong or less corresponded with all Major DJIA Bottoms until the June
1982  low  of  9%  Strong,  which  immediately  preceded  the  stock  market’s
upward explosion.

That slightly higher than “5% Strong or less” Bottom was an important
clue  that  a  reinvigorated  stock  market  was  at  hand;  the  straight-line  DJIA
advance  from  770  to  nearly  1300  ended  a  17-year  “do-nothing”  period  for
stock  prices  and  ushered  in  the  “renewed  upswing”  period  shown  on  the
chart.

In  this  context,  the  “8%  Strong  Bottom”  of  June  1984,  and  the  current
MEI  reading  of  9%  Strong,  take  on  added  meaning.  If,  in  fact,  we  are  in  a
period of Renewed (or major secular) Upswing, stock market Bottoms will
tend  to  be  less  severe  and  Tops  more  extremely  overbought  than  would

otherwise be the case. Both the June 1982 DJIA low and that of June 1984 ﬁt
this model. Because secular stock market waves tend to last for many years,
even  decades,  the  likelihood  is  that  the  current  MEI  reading  of  9%  Strong
will also deﬁne a Major DJIA low.

Trial and Error

You will not expect to turn in a perfect record from the start. You may indeed
do poorly. That is one of the reasons we have suggested using only a safe
amount of your capital, allowing enough leeway so that if you should mis-
read and misdirect your campaigns, or if you should encounter an Interme-
diate Setback in the trend of a Major Turn, you will be able to get back on
course, undismayed, and richer in experience.

Your records of actual transactions (and notes on theoretical transactions)
will help you. As time goes on, you will discover new trading reﬁnements.
Try  these  methods  against  your  previous  chart  records.  See  whether  your
improvements  work  out  consistently  to  your  advantage.  In  that  way,  you
can test new details of method without risking actual capital until you have
checked the operation thoroughly.

In  one  actual  case,  a  trader  who  had  shown  a  rather  poor  record  of
performance through a fast-moving Bear Phase of the market, rechecked 30
of his actual trades made during that period in the light of new methods he
had subsequently developed. Where the original record showed a loss at the
rate  of  about  40%  per  year  on  the  capital  for  the  time  it  was  tied  up,  the
changes he introduced, applied to the same situations, would have resulted
in  a  proﬁt  at  the  annual  rate  of  156%.  Such  a  result,  while  not  conclusive,
would strongly suggest trying out the new method in all similar situations
in the future, and if the performance continued to show this advantage, to
adopt it as a permanent policy. It is only by continual checking and testing
that you can learn to pick up more of the proﬁtable opportunities and protect
yourself better against the unexpected Reversals.

If you follow the suggestions of this book, those already given, and those
in the following chapters, you will proceed slowly and cautiously, not risking
all your capital on a single move in a single stock. Errors and plain bad luck,
when they hurt you, will not hurt you too seriously. You will be prepared
for false moves, wrong interpretations, and complete Reversals of expected
developments.

If you have worked thoughtfully and serenely, without permitting your
emotions to rule your judgment, the law of averages will bring you contin-
ually  greater  success.  You  are  not  gambling  blindly  in  this  work;  you  are
intelligently using past experience as a guide — and it is a dependable guide.
Your operations are part of the competitive workings of a free market; your
purchases and sales are part of the process of interpreting the trend, checking

The market will continue to go up and down in the future as it has in
the past. Your technical knowledge will save you from “buying at the top”
in the ﬁnal Climactic Blow-off, and it will save you from selling everything
in a ﬁt of depression and disgust when the Bottom is being established. In
your  studies  of  past  market  action,  you  have  a  strong  shield  against  the
sudden thrusts that surprise and often defeat the novice trader.

nothing more than 
like buying a top
keep them from making stupid mistakes 
or buying a downtrend or buying before a bottom has completed forming, then their
time will have been well spent. The elimination of amateur blunders such as these
can immeasurably improve investment performance.

How Much Capital 
to Use in Trading

Up  to  this  point,  we  have  been  talking  mostly  in  terms  of  points  and  per-
centages. Little has been said about dollars. From here on we are going to
turn  the  spotlight  on  the  questions  revolving  around  money,  capital,  the
dollars you will actually be using in your operations. For, just as an under-
standing of the technical signals and patterns alone will not guarantee your
proﬁts without a tactical method of applications, so your tactics alone will
not insure you proﬁts until you have tailored your method to ﬁt your pock-
etbook, and until you have a systematic control of your trading in terms of
dollars and cents.

At  the  start  of  your  charting  operations,  you  will  be  using  no  capital.
You will be making no trades either actual or theoretical. Any commitment
you might make during the ﬁrst 4 or 5 weeks on a new chart would be no
more  than  gambling  on  a  hunch.  It  will  take  about  2  months  of  thankless
charting  before  you  have  any  clear  picture  of  how  any  of  your  stocks  are
acting technically. From then on, your chart history will become more valu-
able each week. Your ﬁrst trades probably will be theoretical ones. You will
want to get the feel of the charts and learn to apply the methods you have
studied. Eventually, you will want to make an actual transaction.

EN: The prudence of this approach can hardly be disputed. And, just as markets
have changed, stock market mentality and awareness have changed. The mere exist-
ence of this book and of the general atmosphere enable the modern investor to progress
more rapidly than the old pencil and paper and slide rule chap. The availability of
computers and databases and tutorial tools, not to mention online and ofﬂine courses
in the subject, are unparalleled resources.

Then the question will come up, “How much of my capital shall I use

presupposes  that  the  reader  has  capital.  If  the  reader  does  not  have  capital,  but  is
gambling  with  the  milk  money  or  the  mortgage  payment,  his  failure  is  virtually
assured.  Do  not  speculate  with  money  whose  loss  will  occasion  you  more  than
passing discomfort.

That  will  depend  on  your  circumstances  and  how  much  of  your  time
and effort you plan to put into stock trading, and also on your experience
in the market. If you have been buying and selling stocks for a number of

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

years, you will naturally continue along the same lines, simply applying the
new techniques to your operations.

On the other hand, if stock trading is entirely a new ﬁeld for you, or if
it is only a minor hobby or sideline, it would pay to make haste slowly. Some
writers have pointed out that it usually takes about 2 years to gain enough
practical experience to operate safely in the market, that during the 2-year
apprenticeship  period,  many  traders  come  in,  gradually  lose  their  capital,
and  retire  permanently  from  the  ﬁeld,  leaving  their  money  behind  them.
Therefore,  no  matter  how  conﬁdent  you  may  be  or  how  anxious  to  get  in
and start pitching, it would be safest to do most of your experimenting on
the theoretical basis, and to use only a small amount of your actual capital,
so that after, say, 2 years, if you have shown some actual proﬁts, consistently
and regularly, even though small, you will be much better prepared to use
more of your capital wisely and safely. And conversely, if during that time
you  have  made  repeated  mistakes  and  have  registered  many  unnecessary
losses, you will be able to correct your methods and continue on a sounder
basis, without having lost your main capital reserve.

In  no  case  do  you  want  to  risk  everything  you  can  scrape  together  on
the  theory  that  here  is  the  quick  way  to  make  easy  money.  That  simply  is
not true, and the chances are overwhelmingly against you if you go ahead
under any such plan.

Better  to  ﬁgure  out  how  much  you  can  spare,  how  much  you  could
afford to spend for experience, considering that the amount you start with
is in the same category as money you might use for taking a special course
of instruction, or for improving property you hope to sell. Or, to take another
example,  it  would  be  similar  to  the  salary  you  might  lose  in  accepting  a
lower-paid position in a new kind of work that eventually should be worth
more than your present job.

In other words, you will not depend, from the start, on any returns from
the  capital  you  use  in  trading.  You  will  plan  your  own  budget  outside  of
these funds, even if that calls for trimming your budget to make that possible.
Then  you  can  go  ahead  and  follow  your  trading  method  free  from  any
pressure to take unnecessary risks, free from the need to sell stock prema-
turely to meet obligations, and free from heckling fears and worries.

You can start operations with as little as $500. 

EN: This is especially true
in the Internet Age. Free commissions in many sites and the availability of low cost
diversiﬁed trading instruments like indexes and AMEX trusts offer the small inves-
tor more opportunity than ever before in ﬁnancial market history.
 Better to have
$1000  or  several  thousand.  It  makes  little  difference,  so  long  as  you  have
worked  out  what  you  can  afford  to  use  during  the  apprenticeship  period,
and as long as you are sure you will have capital to continue your operation
as  you  develop  ability.  The  important  thing  at  the  start  is  not  how  many
dollars  you  can  make,  but  what  percentage  of  increase  per  year  you  can
average with the capital you are using.

If  you  approach  the  serious  business  of  trading  in  this  frame  of  mind,
you will not be afraid to take losses when it is necessary (and there are times
when  that  is  the  only  wise  course  to  adopt).  You  will  not  be  straining  to
make  an  unreasonable  or  impossible  proﬁt  (with  the  usual  disastrous
results). And you will be able calmly to build your trading policy in the sure
conviction  that  the  market  will  still  be  there  next  year,  that  opportunities
will still be waiting for you, and that the basic procedures you are developing
are more valuable than any “lucky break” you might pull out of thin air or
a boardroom rumor.

Application of Capital 
in Practice

EN: Today we would refer to this question as “asset allocation,” about which many
learned  books  and  articles  have  been  written  (see  Resources,  Appendix  D).  The
modest suggestions in this chapter are, like Magee, very pragmatic and simple —
and  quite  possibly  more  effective  for  the  general  investor  than  those  complicated
procedures spun out by super computers for complicated Street portfolios.

Let us now restate a number of ideas we have already investigated and
EN: If  the  reader  is  not  in

agreement, he should reread the book up to this point carefully.

1. Major  Trends  ordinarily  run  for  long  periods  of  time,  covering  a

tremendous number of points in total advance or decline.

3.
4.

2. Almost  unbelievable  proﬁts  could  be  made  by  one  who  could  buy
stocks at the extreme Bottom of a Bear Market and sell at the extreme
Top  of  the  following  Bull  Market;  or  sell  short  at  the  extreme  peak
of  a  Bull  Market  and  cover  at  the  extreme  Bottom  of  the  following
Bear Market.
It is not possible to accomplish either of these desirable results.
It  is  possible  to  avoid  becoming  trapped  in  purchases  made  at  or
near the extreme Bull Market Top so that losses become dangerous
or ruinous in a Major Reversal. It is also possible, of course, to avoid
such losses through ill-advised short sales near the extreme Bottom
of a Bear Market.
It is possible to make proﬁts by trading in line with the Major Trend,
and in some cases, by trading on the Intermediate Corrections to the
Major  Trend,  or,  occasionally  on  the  individual  behavior  of  a  stock
which is moving contrary to the Major Trend.

5.

6. The  greatest  and  most  dependable  proﬁts  may  be  made  along  the
Major  Trend  during  the  principal  period  of  advance  (or  decline,  in
the case of short sales), but not during the earliest phases when the
movement ﬁrst gets under way, nor during the rounding off or Re-
versal phenomena near the end of the movement.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Therefore, in order to get the greatest beneﬁts from following the Major
Trends, one would want to have a relatively small equity in the market at
the very start of the move and very little at or near the termination of the
move,  but  a  very  substantial  interest  during  the  mid-portion  when  the
advance or decline was making the greatest headway.

The  writers  have  felt  it  should  be  possible  to  express  this  relation
between the amount of capital tied up and the state of the Major Trend in a
neat  and  deﬁnite  equation.  But  inasmuch  as  the  idea  of  a  Major  Trend  is,
itself, a matter of deﬁnition, and since, as we have already pointed out, the
trend  is  an  abstraction  from  the  individual  movements  of  many  stocks,  it
does  not  seem  possible  to  arrive  at  any  such  easy  solution  to  the  problem
of how much capital to use at a given time.

Nor  is  it  necessary  to  have  a  deﬁnite  and  exact  answer.  As  we  have
already seen, it is possible to set up an Evaluative Index which will give an
approximate answer good enough for all practical purposes so far as weigh-
EN: To  clarify  and  make
ing  the  “strength”  of  the  trend  at  a  particular  time. 
more explicit the concept here, I would point out the Asset Allocation implications
of the Magee Evaluative Index. If the analyst’s analysis of the market indicated that
30% of stocks were bullish, 30% bearish, and 40% neutral he might so commit his
capital — 30% long, 30% short, and 40% cash. This would also assume that his
assessment of risk also indicated that the risks of the long and short positions were
balanced, or approximately equal — approximately equal, since inﬁnite precision is
only achievable by the writers of academic treatises working with excellent hindsight.
There are, however, some other questions. Most importantly, there is the
question of how much total “risk” you are assuming. Since some stocks are
very conservative and others are very speculative, it is not enough to deter-
mine  what  part  of  your  capital  should  be  applied  in  a  market  trend.  The
proportion  of  your  total  capital  used  is  not  necessarily  the  whole  measure
of  your  participation.  The  price  level  of  a  stock  will  affect  its  habits
(low-priced stocks make bigger percentage moves than high-priced stocks).
The amount of margin you are using will have an effect on the degree of risk.
There is some substance to this plan (otherwise we would not be taking
the time to discuss it here at all), but there is a serious question whether the
decision as to the amount of capital to be used at any speciﬁed time can ever

are those who attempt it.

Let us suppose you are convinced that this is a Bull Market, in a phase
of  such  potency  that  you  would  be  justiﬁed  in  using  80%  of  your  capital.
But you will immediately realize, from what has been said in earlier chapters,
that  if  this  money  is  put  into  a  high-priced 
  stock  it  will
not give you as much likelihood of either proﬁt (if you are right) or loss (if
(EN: and  high-beta)
you  are  wrong),  as  it  would  if  put  into  a  lower-priced 
stock. In the same way, your money put into a stock having a low Sensitivity
Index, that is, a conservative stock like a Utility stock, will not give you as
much likelihood for either proﬁt or loss as a stock of high Sensitivity Index
(EN: volatility)
,  that  is,  a  speculative  stock  such  as  an  Internet  issue.  These

593

factors,  quite  as  much  as  the  amount  of  actual  dollars,  affect  your  status,
and are factors in answering the question, “Am I out on a limb and, if so,
how far out?”

To make this perfectly clear, we could take 80% of our capital, say $8000
out of $10,000, and put this amount into the market by purchasing a conser-
vative  preferred  stock,  outright.  A  great  rise  in  the  general  market  might
bring  us  an  increase  in  value  of  a  few  points,  perhaps  4%  or  5%.  And
conversely,  a  great  decline  might  depress  the  issue  by  about  the  same
amount.  An  example  of  going  to  the  other  extreme  might  be  to  purchase
$8000  worth  of  options  on  a  low-priced,  extremely  speculative  stock,  in
which the probable result within 90 days would be either a proﬁt of several
hundred percent, or a total loss of $8000.

Obviously, we could vary our status during the progress of the market
either by increasing or decreasing the amount of the total commitment, or
by changing the nature of the account, switching part of the total into more
or less speculative stocks, higher- or lower-priced stocks, and also by varying
the amount of margin used.

In Appendix A we will show how the principal factors affecting a given
sum of capital used (namely: sensitivity, price, and margin) can be combined
into one ﬁgure, which we are going to call the Composite Leverage Index.
EN: Once again Magee demonstrates a practical vision and intuitive understanding
both of the markets and of the basic character of investing far ahead of investment
theory and understanding of his time. What we have in this concept is nothing less
than the original glimmerings of VAR, or Value at Risk. The concepts and practices
of VAR are succinctly summarized in Chapter 42.

It is perfectly true that you must vary your Composite Leverage 

(EN: risk
exposure)
  so  as  to  take  advantage  of  the  fast-moving  central  portions  of
important  moves,  using  a  lower  Composite  Leverage  at  the  beginning  of
such moves, and during the tapering-off or turning periods near the end.

However, it is one thing to express the Composite Leverage accurately,
and another thing to write a formula for applying speciﬁc degrees of leverage
at  particular  times.  The  method  suggested  at  the  very  beginning  of  this
chapter  has  some  value,  but  owing  to  the  Secondary  Reactions  and  the
difﬁculty of determining Major Trends in individual stocks, it is not possible
to make this into the neat, pat rule we are looking for.

It must be a matter of experience, or intuition based on experience. You
will not permit your Composite Leverage factor to run out to a dangerous
point on the limb. Neither will you allow it to become so low during times
of good market opportunity that you are not getting full beneﬁts from the
move.

We  can  keep  the  general  shape  of  a  Major  Swing  in  our  minds  as  we
consider  this.  Bull  Markets  normally  rise  through  a  series  of  irregular
advances and declines, starting with a moderate upward trend, and gradu-
ally accelerating as the market approaches its ultimate top. Bear Markets are
likely  to  move  fastest  at  the  start,  and  taper  off  gradually  toward  the  end.
Bear Markets are steeper than Bull Markets. These considerations will help

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

us to judge the times when the market will offer the best opportunities, the
times when our Composite Leverage should be increased.

There are other factors, even harder to pin down in simple ﬁgures. We
would, at times, make switches of our holdings for reasons that had no direct
relation to the factors making up the Composite Leverage Index of the stocks.
We know, for example, that high-grade issues, the active market leaders, and
perhaps  some  stocks  of  a  more  conservative  nature  will  tend  to  start  their
moves in a Bull Market fairly early, and to continue their advance at a fairly
steady  pace.  Eventually,  they  will  reach  their  tops  and  make  a  Reversal
Pattern.  They  will  decline  from  this  point,  probably  at  a  steeper  average
angle than the ascent. Low-priced and low-grade issues, on the other hand,
tend  to  be  slow  in  getting  started,  will  remain  dormant  during  the  early
phases of a Bull Market, and will then suddenly and spectacularly skyrocket
in  a  series  of  moves  that  brings  them  to  their  ultimate  Top.  However,  this
Top is likely to be reached at a later point (perhaps months later) than the
point at which many of the more conservative stocks topped out. The spec-
ulative group will then drop very fast and will return to the dead levels of
inaction before the conservative group has ﬁnished its more leisurely Major
Decline.

This means that you will do well to concentrate your Bull Market trading
in the early stages, in the higher-grade stocks, and in the later stages, in the
lower-grade stocks. In a Bear Market, you would perhaps be able to make
short sales unsuccessfully in high-grade stocks even while some of the “cats
and dogs” were still completing their ﬁnal run-up; but you would be watch-
ing  for  the  opportunity  to  cover  those  shorts  and  go  short  the  low-grade
stocks as soon as their Reversal was signaled.

Appendix A will go into the Composite Leverage Index. It should be a
useful  gauge  for  you  in  your  market  operations,  and  a  protection  against
overtrading. But do not expect that you can use it mechanically as an index
against  the  market  to  answer  all  your  questions  involving  the  nature  and
size of your commitments. For in gauging the condition of the Major Trend
at any time, your own experience and judgment must be the ﬁnal arbiters.

Put and Call Options

Options of various sorts have a long history in commercial markets. Nearly
2000 years  ago,  the  merchants  who  operated  in  the  Mediterranean  region
used “to arrive” agreements which amounted to option contracts, as insur-
ance  to  reduce  the  risks  of  storm  and  piracy.  Modern  commodity  futures
contracts  resemble  stock  options  in  their  dual  nature  of  serving  either  as
trading media or as insurance devices. Options are also widely used in real
estate transactions and in various other applications.

For many years, stock options were traded only on the basis of individual
agreement between a buyer or a writer, and an opposite number, directly or
through a broker or dealer. The customer and the writer were free to decide

what stock (any stock) would be optioned, at what exercise or striking price,
for what period of time, and at what premium.

In 1973, a new method of handling option contracts was inaugurated by
the  Chicago  Board  Options  Exchange  and  later  the  American  Stock
Exchange,  and  then  to  other  Exchanges  around  the  country  in  which  call
options on a selected list of actively traded stocks are offered with standard
expiration dates (like commodity contracts) and at deﬁnite exercise prices,
the  premium  depending  on  the  bids  and  offers  of  buyers  and  writers. An

 by Lawrence G. McMillan.

EN: In  the  Internet  Age  options  and  derivatives  markets  have  attained  an
astounding economic importance. One amusing way of measuring this importance
is  by  listing  some  of  the  great  debacles  which  have  occurred  to  major  traders  of
derivatives.  Bank  Negara,  Malaysia’s  central  bank,  lost  $5B  (billion)  in  1992–93
through  bad  bets  on  exchange  rates.  Showa  Shell  Seikiyu,  Japan,  lost  $1.58B  in
1993.  Metallgesellschaft,  Germany,  lost  $1.34B  in  the  same  period.  Barings  Bank
lost $1.33B on stock index futures. From 1987–1995 known losses like this totaled
$16.7B. And, as Magee would say, etc., etc. Of course, compared to the estimated
total  market  in  1995  of  $25T  (trillion),  this  is  a  mere  bagatelle.  Perhaps  this  is
sufﬁcient to warn the general investor that the ﬁeld is strewn with ﬁnancial mines
for even the sophisticated.

EN9:  If  the  investor  considers  stocks  a  complex  or  difﬁcult  area  (though  it  is
hoped this book will make it less so for him) options are exponentially more difﬁcult.
Professionals beat amateurs at that game so thoroughly and so often as to consider
it easy money. So the general investor should be sternly warned that much training
and study should be undertaken before becoming fodder for the pros.

Portfolio Risk Management*

As  we  suggested  in  the  preceding  chapter,  there  is  some  relation  between
the  state  or  stage  of  a  Major  Market  and  its  potentialities  for  proﬁt.  There
are  many  mechanical  plans  and  systems  for  coping  with  the  problem,  but
we  do  not  believe  it  can  be  fully  solved  by  mechanical  means  alone.  We
mentioned  one  plan  by  which  the  commitments  were  governed  according

Evaluative Index, or MEI.
 There are other plans which depend on pyramiding
the commitment as the trend proceeds; and still others which are based on
averaging  costs  by  increasing  the  commitment  working  against  the  trend,
that  is,  by  buying  on  a  scale-down  at  progressively  lower  levels  in  a  Bear

Market, and selling on a scale-up in Bull Markets. 
both techniques. Avoid such methods.)

None  of  the  plans,  taken  by  themselves,  are  adequate  to  answer  the
questions  of  when  to  buy  and  when  to  sell.  The  primary  purpose  of  this
book  is  to  study  the  technical  phenomena  of  individual  stocks.  If  we  can
learn  from  the  charts  at  what  points  to  buy  and  under  what  conditions  to
sell,  we  have  acquired  the  basic  machinery  for  successful  trading.  On  the
other hand, obviously, if your buying and selling are at points which more
often than not result in net losses, then it makes no difference how you divide
up your capital or apply it in the market, for it will be bound to shrink until,

situation should set a benchmark. He should decide that if he loses 50% of his capital
he will quit trading and put his money in mutual funds or in the hands of an advisor.
Generally speaking, an advisor is preferable to a mutual fund. And both are preferable
to an investor with two left feet. They can certainly do no worse than a consistently
losing performer.

The  ﬁrst  problem,  then,  is  to  learn  to  use  the  technical  tools,  patterns,
trends, Supports, Resistances, etc. Then we can consider how much money
we will risk and in what way.

We  have  already  seen  that  it  makes  a  difference,  sometimes  a  great
difference,  how  we  apply  our  capital.  The  various  factors  of  price  level,
sensitivity, and margin enter into the concept we are going to call the Com-
posite  Leverage  Index.  In  Appendix  A,  we  will  give  a  deﬁnition  of  this.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Meanwhile,  we  have  said  enough  so  you  will  understand  what  we  are
driving at if we use the term in connection with your market commitments.
You realize, of course, that you do not want to be so conservative that
you will rule out practically all opportunities for making gains. If you decide
never to oppose the Primary Trend, you will have to be inactive during long
Secondary  Trends,  and  may  be  left  waiting,  sometimes  for  weeks  on  end,
for a continuation of the Primary Move. Naturally, you will pass up all weak
signals and convergent trends, and shun new commitments after very active
blow-offs or Panic Climaxes. You could, no doubt, carry your reﬁnement of
caution  so  far  that  your  percentage  of  success,  instead  of  being  a  mere  60,
70, or 80%, might approach 90%; you might actually be right 95% of the time
in your decisions. But this extreme conservatism would also mean that you
would  trade  only  in  the  very  ﬁnest  possible  situations,  when  every  factor
was  clean-cut  and  favorable. You  would  not  have  such  opportunities  very
often.  The  result  might  be  a  proﬁt,  but  too  small  a  proﬁt  to  justify  all  the
work and study you would be putting into your charts, for you can obtain
nominally respectable returns on your capital without very much study and
without much risk, and you must expect a much higher rate of return if your
efforts are to be worthwhile.

EN: These “nominally respectable returns” are obtained by investing in T Bonds
and  similar  instruments.  Bond  traders  and  investors  traditionally  consider  these
investments “risk free,” which is, of course, another form of the denial of reality. In
reality  as  David  Dreman  has  demonstrated  (
Contrarian  Investment  Strategy,
Simon & Schuster) bonds are a kind of deteriorating asset due to the unarrestable
depreciation in the commodity-denominated value of currency.

hence, more risk of loss. You have to accept, deliberately, a greater risk than
the man who is content to buy a “safe” security, put it in the box, and forget it.
 at or near
some  constant  level  which  your  experience  and  judgment  tells  you  is  safe
for the particular state of the market, you will be protected against overcau-
tion.  More  important,  if  you  maintain  this  Composite  Leverage  in  your
operations, you will be protected against unconsciously overtrading. This is
a fault more common than extreme caution, and can be a dangerous enemy
even when your percentage of theoretical trading gains is high. When you
select  a  deﬁnite  Composite  Leverage 
  and
adhere to it in your trading commitments, changing it as necessary to meet
changed conditions, you will be forced to restrain your enthusiasm within
safe limits, and you will be continually aware of the risks you are taking.

Overtrading — and a Paradox

This leads to another point. A series of identical percentage gains and losses
on your capital does not give you a series of equal gains and losses in dollars
and cents. This is a serious problem, worth understanding, for a trader who

is greatly overextended is intensifying this problem (which exists in any case,
but  which  does  not  need  to  cause  him  too  much  worry  if  he  has  planned
his program).

You can understand the paradoxical statement that percentage gains and
losses  are  not  equal  if  you  take  the  extreme  case,  ﬁrst,  of  a  man,  who,  in
every business venture he enters, risks his entire capital with the expectation
of either a 100% gain or a 100% loss. If this ﬁrst venture is a loss, he loses
100%. He is ﬁnished, because he cannot gain by making 100% on nothing.
However, if the ﬁrst venture is successful and he then uses his entire capital,
including the new proﬁts, again on the same terms, and the second venture
is a failure, he will be wiped out completely. No matter how many successes
EN: This is, of
he may have, he stands to lose everything on his ﬁrst failure. 
course, the problem of “gambler’s ruin,” which has been admirably analyzed by a
number of writers, including Niederhoffer with the most delightful illustration. See
Resources (Appendix D) for the formula and discussion.

In  a  lesser  degree,  this  is  the  situation  we  are  speaking  of. You  would
not risk all of your capital on a basis of doubling your money or losing all.
But  suppose  you  were  extended,  continually,  to  a  point  where  you  were
taking the risk of a 40% net loss on each transaction, with the hope of a 40%
net  gain.  Should  you  start  with  $1000  and  have  a  succession  of  10  losses,
you would wind up with about $6. Now suppose the very next 10 transac-
tions  were  all  successful.  You  would  ﬁnally  come  out,  after  10  losses  and
10 gains, each of 40%, with capital of less than $100. It would not be necessary
either that these 10 losses and 10 gains come in the order given. You might
have the 10 gains ﬁrst, or three gains, four losses, seven gains, and then six
losses. The result would be the same. After 10 gains and losses, in any order,
you would have lost more than 90% of your capital.

On  the  other  hand,  if  you  risked  your  entire  capital  each  time  on
20 ventures,  in  10  of  which  you  took  an  8%  net  gain  and  in  10  an  8%  net
loss, your $1000 after the 10 gains and losses would be reduced only to $937.
You  would  still  have  about  94%  of  your  original  capital.  Therefore,  in  this
case (and 8% is a fair average ﬁgure for short-term transactions resulting in
a  loss,  in  fact,  a  rather  liberal  ﬁgure  according  to  extensive  tabulations  of
actual transactions), you would have a handicap due to this paradox of only
about 

 of 1% on each trade.

Now it is conceivable that 10 successive trades 

 go wrong, though
that  would  be  an  unusual  condition.  There  was  one  period  of  10  months
between the actual turn of the market and the Dow Signal for a Reversal of
the Primary Trend. True, the resulting new trend, once established, ran far
and long, and would have made up all losses and produced ﬁne proﬁts. But
during  the  10  hard  months,  allowing  the  fair  average  time  of  30 days  per
transaction,  it  is  possible  that  10  successive  wrong-way  trades  might  have
been stopped out for losses, reducing the original $1000 to $434.

The  important  thing  here  is  that  the  next  10  successful  trades  would
have brought this $434 back to $937; in other words, you could have righted
the boat and sailed right on if you were working on the 8% basis, whereas

if you had been following the 40% basis we gave previously as an example,
you would have been sunk without a trace, a victim of overtrading.

Therefore,  by  maintaining  a  sane  Composite  Leverage  Index

  and  letting  the  law  of  averages  work  for  you
and  with  you,  you  will  be  on  solid  mathematical  ground.  Your  technical
studies  will  have  every  opportunity  to  make  you  a  proﬁt.  Otherwise  you
can, simply by unwise overextension of your trading, prevent even the best
technical analysis from producing a net proﬁt.

EN: John Magee could easily be called the father of modern investment theory
but  modern  investment  theory  is  so  unenlightened  as  to  technical  analysis  that
academics largely have not recognized his contributions — and many probably have
not  read  his  work.  If  they  had,  he  would  be  recognized  as  having  identiﬁed  what

theorists now call systematic risk, or what is now called the

precedes (and may be more practical than) modern portfolio risk analysis, if cum-
bersome in the modern context.

In  his  original  exposition  of  Composite  Leverage  in  this  chapter  Magee  made
use of some cumbersome manual procedures which I have relegated to Appendix A.
There is nothing invalid about them, but there might be more simple and convenient
ways for the present-day trader to assess his leverage, his risk, and proﬁt exposure.
One of these is certainly utilizing VAR technology. But — or, and — there might
be simpler more pragmatic (and even more effective) ways of extracting this infor-
mation from our trading portfolios.

Volatility,  for  example,  tells  us  something  about  the  risk  of  a  stock.  Portfolio
volatility gives us a way of measuring the riskiness of a group of stocks. In research-
ing our systems and methods we should be able to get some handle on “drawdown,”
or the largest negative swing against our equity in an account. Simple conclusions
follow: if we are willing to accept larger risks, we pick a portfolio of volatile stocks —
a portfolio of Internet (or whatever the current frenzy is) stocks rather than a portfolio
of utility stocks.

It is indispensable to maintain a regular periodic review of portfolio statistics
to  assure  oneself  that  excessive  risks  are  not  being  undertaken  heedlessly.  These
important numbers include:

Risk of a Single Stock 

The beginning of conventional, or academic, analysis of risk is the examination of
volatility.

The  formula  for  calculating  the  volatility  of  a  stock  (or  downloading  it)  was
discussed in Chapter 24. As a theoretical exercise, the formula and the theory make
certain  assumptions  which  are  not  necessarily  of  interest  to  the  pragmatic  practi-
tioner.  One  of  the  assumptions  is  that  the  holder  chooses  to  accept  the  inherent
volatility of the stock at hand. But the point of technical analysis is to limit the risk
accepted  while  attempting  to  realize  proﬁt  opportunities.  Thus  the  volatility  of  a
stock, its risk, is 0.30 or 30%, but when we trade it, we put a stop loss on it and
only risk a move of (say arbitrarily) 5–8% against our position. (Where the 5-8%
sums to 2-3%, or x of total capital.) So our method of risk control is basically more
dynamic than the theory. Nonetheless, volatility will give us a measure of the stocks
which make interesting trading vehicles.

It is perfectly possible to take our own experience with a stock, or our system’s
 using the method
experience with a stock and calculate its volatility 
described in Chapter 24. If the dispersion of its returns was greater than our appetite,
we could then eliminate it from our watch list. To my knowledge the literature does
not mention this method for customizing our analysis of risk. Use of a customizing
procedure  like  this  would  give  us  an  idea  of  the  reliability  of  our  methods  in  a
particular  case.  Stocks  which  didn’t  behave  would  be  banished  to  the  portfolios  of
mutual fund managers.

to ourselves,

Risk of a Portfolio 

If you have sufﬁcient experience with a portfolio, you can calculate its volatility the
same way you calculate the volatility of a stock. And the method in Chapter 24 can
be  used.  You  may  also  dramatize  the  volatility  of  your  portfolio  by  preparing  a
frequency  distribution.  The  dispersion  of  the  returns  would  certainly  highlight
characteristics of your trading system or style.

Academicians and investment managers use a measure called the Sharpe Ratio
to  compare  the  performance  of  two  systems  or  competing  money  managers.  It  is
discussed  in  Resources  (Appendix  D),  and  has  severe  deﬁciencies  in  analyzing
portfolio risk. I will address this question later in this chapter after looking at some
of the ways professionals treat risk.

The reader may judge for himself in the use of Composite Leverage as presented
in  Appendix  A  by  Magee,  or  he  may  consider  the  following  brief  presentation  of
modern portfolio management and risk analysis. The purpose of Composite Leverage
is  to  measure  and  control  risk  and  proﬁt  exposure  in  a  more  or  less  quantitative
manner.  Present-day  portfolio  managers  might  use  VAR  technology,  or  do  this  as
follows.  The  Editor  offers  this  exposition  only  for  perspective.  His  own  preferred
method, Pragmatic Portfolio Theory, follows thereafter.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

EN9: Risk and Trend 

Risk of a Portfolio and risk of a stock are affected by being the right way in
the trend. It seems intuitive and it is observable that losses (thus risk) expand
in  an  Enron  case  where  the  trader  remains  long  while  the  stock  dies.  The
converse is also true. Risk is diminished to a portfolio and a stock when it
is with the trend. In a paper submitted to the Market Technicians Association
(mta.org), 
Bassetti  and  Brooker  argue  (with  some
success in the opinion of this editor) that risk can be proved to diminish in
the Industrials when the portfolio (of Industrials) is with the trend as iden-
tiﬁed  by  Dow  Theory.  Charts  9.1  and  9.2  present  other  material  from  this
paper which is available at the Magee website, www.edwards-magee.com.

Dissecting  Dow  Theory, 

VAR Procedure

Returns of the individual securities are determined and, from these, returns of the
portfolio  are  calculated.  This  is  done  based  upon  some  time  period  for  which  the
portfolio  is  held.  Thus,  from  day  to  day  the  returns,  or  changes  in  value,  of  the
portfolio will vary — some positive and some negative. Taking a totality of returns,
an average return will be determined. A frequency distribution of returns may be
constructed. The width of this frequency distribution measures the riskiness of the
portfolio.  Thus,  a  portfolio  which  has  a  minimum  return  of  1%  and  a  maximum
return of 8% is inherently less risky (according to investment theory) than one with
returns varying from –1% to 20%. And while a frequency distribution is illustrative,
it does not give us a common measure for two different portfolios. That is done by
determining the volatility of the portfolio.

Volatility measures the deviation of returns from the mean. This is known as
the  standard  deviation  and  is  indicated  by  the  Greek  letter  sigma  (
).  The  higher
the  volatility  of  a  portfolio  the  greater  its  risk,  according  to  the  academic  theory.
This  would  seem  to  be  intuitive,  in  that  a  commodity  portfolio  might  range  from
–30%  to  100%  returns  because  of  leverage,  whereas  a  bond  portfolio  would  vary
only by the market price of the bonds and would return face value at maturity. Of
course in calculating bond risks, managers ignore the deterioration of money — but
that is a little secret among us pragmatic analysts and we needn’t bother academi-
cians  and  bond  traders  with  that  information,  as  they  wouldn’t  want  to  know  it
anyway.

σ

As  pointed  out  above,  portfolio  volatility  can  be  easily  obtained  if  we  have
sufﬁcient  experience  with  the  portfolio.  If  we  have  to  calculate  the  volatility,  the
procedure gets quite complicated and the entire procedure for determining our VAR
requires some statistical sophistication as well as a gamut of data. We must weight
the  components  of  our  portfolio,  determine  their  correlations,  compute  correlation
 at
coefﬁcients, and on and on. And, as Mandelbrot notes in 
the end of all this, we would still be wondering what to do in the

Pragmatic Portfolio Theory (and Practice) 

Perhaps, rather than giving ourselves headaches trying to remember college statis-
tics, we should look for something simpler and more pragmatic — something just
as  serviceable  for  the  general  investor:  Pragmatic  Portfolio  Theory.  The  academic
world, and the world of rareﬁed Wall Street, strives madly to quantify everything
in  the  world  except  the  risks  and  liabilities  that  they  themselves  create  for  their
customers.

Let us seek simpler methods to quantify the risks of individual stocks and the
portfolios they reside in, knowing all the time that absolute precision is impossible.

1957,  1987,  1989.  Viz.,  Long-Term  Capital  Management  which  almost  brought
down the world ﬁnancial system in 1998, and Leland O’Brien Rubinstein Portfolio
Insurance which contributed mightily to the Reagan Crash in 1987.)

Pragmatic Portfolio Risk Measurement 

Determining the Risk of One Stock 

The  theoretical  risk  of  a  stock  is  commonly  agreed  to  be  its  volatility,  which  is
determined  as  detailed  in  Chapter 24.  So  we  might  say  that  the  theoretical  risk  of
our stock, Microsoft, for example, equals on 100 shares, our position, at the market
price of 120 and annualized volatility of .44:

Theoretically speaking then, the annual risk for Microsoft should be volatility

 120 or $52. In fact, those non-chart analysts who bought
Price or (in 2000) 0.44 
Microsoft at 120 (there were some) and who did not have the technician’s ability to
set  a  stop  and  discipline  to  stick  to  it  saw  a  risk  of  50%  from  its  top  of  120  in
February 2000 to its (presumed) bottom of 60 in June 2000.

×

There is another measurement which might be more meaningful to us, Opera-
tional Risk. Operational Risk refers to the speciﬁc instance of the particular trade.
For  example,  we  have  taken  an  initial  position  in  Microsoft  of  100  shares.  Our
analysis has identiﬁed a stop point where we put our stop, which is 5% away from
the market price. Our Operational Risk is:

Determining the Risk for a Portfolio 

Computing the theoretical risk for a portfolio is quite a complex process. It
involves, in essence, ﬁnding the volatility for the portfolio as a whole, and
multiplying the portfolio market value by the portfolio volatility. This does
not  sound  so  complex,  but  volatility  is  not  determined  by  simply  adding
together  volatilities  of  individual  securities.  Rather,  correlations  between
instrument returns must be computed, and variance and covariance of secu-
rities must be determined as steps along the way. This by no means presumes
to be a complete description of the process, further study of which may be
guided by entries in Resources (Appendix D).

The theoretical risk for a portfolio is, for a simple case:

Volatility Market Value

TP$Risk = MV V

where

Under  normal  market  conditions,  the  Operational  Risk  of  a  simple  Portfolio,
PO$Risk, may be calculated by ﬁrst taking the sum of the Operational Risk ﬁgures,
O$Risk,  for  each  stock  held  long.  Then  the  sum  of  O$Risk  for  short  positions  is
subtracted from the ﬁrst ﬁgure.

PO$Risk

Measuring Maximum Drawdown, 
or Maximum Retracement 

In the designing and testing of a system, or in actual trading experience, we care
little about standard deviations and cold statistics. What bothers us is the ﬂow of
blood,  that  is  to  say,  the  worst  run  of  “luck”  or  experience  we  have.  What  is  the
greatest sustained loss we suffer before our system or trading method rights itself,
stanches the ﬂow of blood, and begins to accumulate proﬁts again? Constructing a
wave  chart  is  one  way  to  look  at  this  experience.  (A  wave  chart  is  illustrated  in
Figure 2.)

Measuring  from  the  top  of  the  wave  to  the  bottom  gives  us  our  maximum
drawdown, and an idea of what amount of capital we need and how much reserves
to  maintain.  It  also  gives  us  a  vivid  depiction  of  our  results.  A  chart  with  many
tsunamis  (in  the  wrong  direction)  probably  means  that  we  need  to  modify  our
methods — unless we genuinely enjoy riding roller coasters (with the full under-
standing that dreadful accidents do sometimes happen on thrill rides). If constructing
a system without actual market experience, one should multiply maximum draw-
down by 3 or 4 to get a reasonable amount of capital to back the system with.

Pragmatic Portfolio Analysis: Measuring the Risk 

In analyzing a portfolio, we must ﬁrst know what is important to measure. In order
to be able to control risk, we must be able to measure it. Theoreticians identify risk
with volatility. There are some real-life problems with this concept but we will use
it for the moment anyway. In a portfolio, we want to be able to separate our various
types  and  weights  of  risk.  In  terms  of  volatility,  bonds  are  obviously  less  volatile
than  stocks,  and  unleveraged  commitments  are  less  volatile  than,  say,  futures.
Similarly, if the portfolio is not risk balanced, that is, if one issue represents a large
proportion  of  the  whole,  then  it  represents  a  larger  portion  of  the  risk.  But,  if  a
portfolio  consisted  of  only  the  S&P  500,  that  would  obviously  be  a  different  case,
since a commitment like this would be by deﬁnition diversiﬁed. So we must know
what  is  important  to  measure.  (Cf.  Philippe  Jorion’s 
.  In  addition
there is a piece of tutorial software called Risk Management 101, which is excellent
in presenting these concepts.)

Value  At  Risk

In operational or pragmatic terms, a trader wants to know what his operational
risk  is,  rather  than  his  theoretical  risk.  And  he  doesn’t  consider  upside  equity
volatility a negative. A trader may choose to measure risk by the pragmatic method
  or
outlined  here.  In  doing  so,  he  will  want  to  know  for  his  Portfolio

dividing for the desired time period (and plotted). It may also be computed by taking

Portfolio Extraordinary or Catastrophic Risk

 is the risk of market collapse or panic on any given day. The
Extraordinary Risk
way to look at this risk is, ﬁrst of all, to assume normal behavior of the markets, or
your everyday panic. In this case, if all of one’s positions cratered, one would take
his worst-case, one-day loss and be out of the market. To extend this analysis, assume
that  the  market  makes  a  two,  then  four,  then  six  standard  deviation  move.  What
will be the effect on your position in this event, when stops will not be honored by
specialists and market makers and the market will be stampeding like spooked cattle
for the exits? That is, meltdown. This is

 or 

Controlling the Risk 

The  most  danger  in  these  meltdown  events  is  in  the  greatest  leverage  —  so  the
greatest risk is in short options — and usually short puts. You will remember my
story of my customer who lost $57MM during the Reagan Crash of 1987. He was
short puts. Some market makers have been destroyed by shorting calls, but the case
is rare and speciﬁcally results in the case of takeovers and unwise concentration of
commitments in one issue only.

The least risk lies in being hedged. To oversimplify, long the stock, long the put.
The  proﬁt  of  one  makes  up  for  the  loss  on  the  other.  Also,  if  one  were  long  some
stocks  and  short  others,  that  also  is  a  kind  of  hedge.  Or  long  the  Dow  and  short
futures on the Dow, or some of its components.

Now let us be pragmatic. If we have during the management of our portfolios
consistently  measured  the  market  with  the  Magee  Evaluative  Index  and  balanced
our  portfolio  accordingly,  we  will  be  at  less  risk,  both  from  the  Ordinary  and  the
Extraordinary  viewpoint.  In  fact,  we  may  proﬁt  from  an  event  which  disemploys
many professional money managers.

If  you  have  been  religiously  raising  your  stops,  following  the  market  with
progressive  stops,  and  in  fact  raising  them  based  on  new  highs  as  described  in
Chapter 28  (3-days-away  procedure),  it  is  quite  possible  that  while  the  market  is
storming you will be sailing to Byzantium in your customer yacht.

Summary of Risk and Money Management Procedures 

The procedures described above are easily reducible to simple formulas, even for the
mathophobic.

Trade  size  is  the  basic  unit  for  controlling  risk.  Regardless  of  volatility,  500

shares of anything is riskier than 100 shares.

To determine trade size, take the difference between the entry price and the stop

total capital to be ventured on the trade, and multiply times Total Capital — e.g.,
3% times TC of $100,000, giving Risk-per-Trade. Divide Dollar Risk 1 by Risk-per-

high, look for hedges or positions to eliminate, starting, of course, with those which

more than 8% from the market price will be risked. And this 8% must represent no

Professional risk managers compute daily the Extraordinary Risk potential in
the  markets  using  the  procedure  described  above  to  constrain  traders  under  their

There is almost always a prepanic phase which the truly alert trader can identify,
especially with the aid of a computer. These are marked by insider and professional
selling  which  creates  increasing  volume  with  Reversal  Days  occurring  in  many
stocks and Gaps and Runaway down days. Almost always these conditions will be
preceded by many top formations among key stocks — double and triple tops and

Stick to Your Guns

It has often been pointed out that any of several different plans of operation,
if followed consistently over a period of years, would have produced con-
sistently a net gain on market operations. The methods we have discussed
in this book (representing the technical approach) are a case in point.

The fact is, however, that many traders, not having set up a basic strategy
and having no sound philosophy of what the market is doing and why, are
at  the  mercy  of  every  Panic,  boom,  rumor,  tip,  in  fact,  of  every  wind  that
blows. And since the market, by its very nature, is a meeting place of con-
ﬂicting and competing forces, they are constantly torn by worry, uncertainty,
and doubt. As a result, they often drop their good holdings for a loss on a
sudden dip or shakeout; they can be scared out of their short commitments
by  a  wave  of  optimistic  news;  they  spend  their  days  picking  up  gossip,
passing on rumors, trying to conﬁrm their beliefs or alleviate their fears; and
they spend their nights weighing and balancing, checking and questioning,
in a welter of bright hopes and dark fears.

Furthermore, a trader of this type is in continual danger of getting caught
in  a  situation  that  might  be  truly  ruinous.  Since  he  has  no  ﬁxed  guides  or
danger points to tell him when a commitment has gone bad and it is time
to  get  out  with  a  small  loss,  he  is  prone  to  let  stocks  run  entirely  past  the
red  light,  hoping  that  the  adverse  move  will  soon  be  over,  and  that  there
will  be  a  “chance  to  get  out  even,”  a  chance  that  often  never  comes. And,
even  should  stocks  be  moving  in  the  right  direction  and  showing  him  a
proﬁt, he is not in a much happier position, since he has no guide as to the
point at which to take these proﬁts. The result is he is likely to get out too
soon and lose most of his possible gain, or overstay the market and lose part
or all of the expected proﬁts.

If  you  have  followed  the  preceding  chapters  carefully,  you  will  have
realized  that  none  of  the  technical  formations  and  signals  is  certain  and

information  about  that  stock  (which 
declared or expected, split-ups, and mergers that are known to be planned,
political angles as they affect the market, world affairs, management, earning
records, etc.). The chart does not and cannot forecast unforeseeable events,
matters that are completely unknown to anybody. In a majority of cases, the
charts are dependable. If you are not satisﬁed that this is true, you should
study further, or else plan not to use charts at all.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

On the other hand, if you have satisﬁed yourself that the charts are, for
you, the most dependable indication of the probable future course of stock
prices,  then  you  should  follow  explicitly  the  signals  given  on  your  charts,
either  according  to  the  rules  we  suggest  here,  or  according  to  such  other
rules and modiﬁcations as your experience dictates. But while you are fol-
lowing any set of rules and policies, follow them to the letter. It is the only
way they can help you.

If you do this, you will have certain large advantages, right at the start:
(1) you will never be caught in a situation where a single stock commitment
can wipe out your entire capital and ruin you; (2) you will not ﬁnd yourself
frozen in a market that has turned against you badly, with a large accumu-
lated loss and your capital tied up, so that you cannot use it in the reversed
trend to make new and potentially proﬁtable commitments; and (3) you can
make your decisions calmly, knowing exactly what you will be looking for
as  a  signal  to  take  proﬁts,  and  knowing  also  that  your  losses,  at  the  very
worst, will be limited to a certain deﬁnite amount.

All of this means that you will have peace of mind. You will take losses
and you will make gains. In neither case will you have to take your notebooks
home  and  lie  awake  worrying.  You  will  have  made  certain  decisions.  If
developments prove you were right, you will, at the proper point, take your
proﬁt.  And  if  it  turns  out  that  you  were  wrong,  then  you  can  take  your
comparatively small loss, and start looking for a better situation, with your
capital still largely intact, liquid, and available.

Your  job,  as  a  speculator,  is  to  provide  liquidity  in  the  market,  and  to
counteract the irrational excesses of market-in-motion. Part of that job is to
keep  yourself  free  to  become  liquid  whenever  it  is  necessary,  in  order  to
reverse your position. And to keep yourself free from irrational and excessive
emotional actions. If you do this intelligently and consistently, you will be
performing a useful and necessary service to the general economic welfare,
and you will ﬁnd that the market offers as good or better returns for your
efforts as any other line of endeavor.

Chapter A
(Magee’s Original Chapter 24 from the Seventh Edition)

The Probable Moves of Your Stocks

At  ﬁrst  glance,  all  stocks  appear  to  move  helter-skelter  without  rhyme  or
reason, all over the lot. All stocks go up at times, and all go down at times —
not  always  at  the  same  time.  But  we  already  have  seen  that  in  these  rises
and falls, stocks do follow trends, make various typical patterns, and behave
in a not completely disorderly manner.

upward

It is also true that each stock has its own habits and characteristics, which
are more or less stable from year to year. Certain stocks normally respond
to  a  Bullish  Phase  of  the  market  with  a  very  large  upsurge,  while  others,
perhaps in the same price class, will make only moderate moves. You will
ﬁnd that the same stocks which make wide 
 swings are also the ones
declines
 in Bear Markets, whereas the ones that make less
which make large 
spectacular up-moves are more resistant to downside breaks in the market.
In Appendix A, Chapter B you will ﬁnd in a discussion of Composite Lever-
age  that  there  are  stocks  which  ordinarily  move  many,  many  times  as  fast
as  others.  We  do  not  know,  for  example,  whether  a  year  from  now  Glenn

and it is one of the most dependable things we know, that whichever way
it is going, it will be covering ground much faster than American Telephone

issue, ﬂoating supply, nature of business, and leverage in the capital struc-
ture, matters we have touched on brieﬂy before. As a matter of fact, we are

to make possible proﬁtable commitments that will cover costs and leave a

probability of at least a 15% move in your stock.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

By examining the record of a certain stock for a number of years back,
and comparing the percentage moves it has made with the percentage moves
of the market as a whole, you can obtain a fair picture of that stock’s habits.
You  will  not  be  able  to  say,  at  any  particular  moment,  “This  stock  is  now
going  to  move  up  25%,”  but  you  can  say,  with  a  good  deal  of  conﬁdence,
“If the market as a whole makes an advance of 10%, this stock will probably
advance  about  25%.”  Or,  conversely,  of  course,  “If  the  market  goes  down
10%, this stock will very likely go down at least 25%.”

Many methods have been used for measuring and checking these per-
centage-move  habits,  differing  only  in  detail.  Indexes  on  several  hundred
important  stocks  listed  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  have  been  com-
puted by the authors and are presented in Appendix A, Chapter D, Sensi-
tivity Indexes.

EN: Current day betas may be compared with these and/or substituted for them
in  other  computations  suggested  in  this  book,  for  example  in  Composite  Leverage
formulas. The reader may read in the following text “beta” for “Sensitivity Index”
and avoid the annoyance of excessive notation by the editor.

(EN: beta)

The Indexes are relative. They show that stocks with a high Sensitivity
Index 
 will move much faster in either Bull Markets or Bear Markets
than  stocks  with  low  Indexes,  and  about  how  much  faster,  relative  to  the
other stocks.

(EN9: The general investor who in the 21st century operates with a computer
and the Internet will not ﬁnd the following necessary reading.) 
In order to compute
the  Sensitivity  Indexes,  the  range  of  each  stock  from  high  closing  to  low
closing, each sheet of the chart is marked with a dotted blue (top) and red
(bottom) line in the left-hand margin of the next chart sheet for that particular
stock. At the end of each series of chart sheets, this price range for each stock
in the period covered by the chart sheet just ﬁnished is measured from top
(blue) line to red (bottom) line, and these ranges, expressed in eighths of an
inch, are added together and divided by the total number of stocks charted.
  for  the  period,  representing  the  composite
This  gives  you  an 
or average movement of the entire group of stocks. An arbitrary “normal”
average range is permanently selected (on the basis of the average range for
a  number  of  series  of  charts  for  several  years),*  and  as  each  series  of  new
charts is completed, this “normal” average range is divided by the average
range for the new series, to arrive at a decimal fraction which represents the
reciprocal of that market movement for the period. (Thus, a period of wide
market activity would show a small decimal less than 1, such as 0.65, whereas
a period of dull and inactive markets would result in a larger ﬁgure, such
as 1.49.) We will call this (just to give it a handy name for future reference)
the Market Reciprocal for this period or series of charts.

average  range

*  Theoretically,  the  “normal”  average  range  should  be  adjusted  continuously  at  the  close  of
each period. Practically, there is no need for such reﬁnement.

Now the price range, expressed in eighths of an inch, for each stock in
turn, is divided by the range corresponding to the “normal” or average range
for a stock at that price (see Range-for-Price table, Appendix A, Chapter C),
and this fraction is multiplied by the Market Reciprocal. The resulting ﬁgure
is the fractional Sensitivity Index covering the action of this particular stock
for this particular market period. In order to obtain the overall or long-term
Sensitivity Index for a stock, we simply add the fractional indexes for each
period together and divide by the number of periods. As new chart sheets
are  completed,  we  add  the  new  fractions  and  compute  the  new  index.  A
single fractional index is, as you might expect, unreliable and rather mean-
ingless as regards the future. The second, third, and fourth series fractions
will  revise  and  “smooth”  the  Index.  As  time  goes  on  and  new  series  are
added, these Sensitivity Indexes will settle down to fairly constant ﬁgures;
corrections, if any, will be slight as new series are added. And these Indexes
are very reliable in forecasting the probable future sensitivity of each stock.
The  measuring  of  price  ranges  in  eighths  of  an  inch,  in  order  to  get
ﬁgures representing percentage moves, implies of course that you are using
a ratio chart paper. With other types of paper, you would have to compute
the  percentage  price  range  for  each  period  from  the  high  and  low  closing
prices on your charts.

We  have  outlined  this  method  in  some  detail  so  that  you  can,  if  you

modern reader will probably wish to obtain betas, if interested, from sources docu-
mented in Resources (Appendix D). 
It is not necessary that your stocks all be
from  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange.  Using  this  method,  you  can  include
others from other exchanges, averaging them all together and treating your
entire portfolio as a group in determining your Market Reciprocals. 

You will ﬁnd that sensitivity runs from over 2.00 (which we would speak
of as 200%) in the case of highly speculative issues, down to 0.20 (20%, that
is) or less on ultraconservative investment stocks. Roughly, you may consider
that stocks with a Sensitivity Index of 50% or less are extremely conservative,
50% to 100% moderately conservative, 100% to 150% speculative, and any-
thing over 150% highly speculative.

this chapter. The editor has kindly supplied some comments as an endnote, which
will aid those interested in Magee’s thinking. As the chapter predates much work
in risk analysis and portfolio management theory, I have left it “as is.” In concept,
it certainly has more than historical value and can in fact be used by the manual
chart-keeping investor. The concern of the chapter, namely measuring portfolio risk,
is addressed for the computerized investor in Chapter 42.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

As we suggested in the preceding chapter, there is some relation between
the  state  or  stage  of  a  Major  Market  and  its  potentialities  for  proﬁt.  There
are  many  mechanical  plans  and  systems  for  coping  with  the  problem,  but
we  do  not  believe  it  can  be  fully  solved  by  mechanical  means  alone.  We
mentioned  one  plan  by  which  the  commitments  were  governed  according
(EN:  The  Magee
to  the  consensus  of  trends  in  an  entire  portfolio  of  charts. 
Evaluative  Index.)
  There  are  other  plans  which  depend  on  pyramiding  the
commitment  as  the  trend  proceeds;  and  still  others  which  are  based  on
averaging  costs  by  increasing  the  commitment  working  against  the  trend,
that  is,  by  buying  on  a  scale-down  at  progressively  lower  levels  in  a  Bear
Market, and selling on a scale-up in Bull Markets.

None  of  the  plans,  taken  by  themselves,  are  adequate  to  answer  the
questions  of  when  to  buy  and  when  to  sell.  The  primary  purpose  of  this
book  is  to  study  the  technical  phenomena  of  individual  stocks.  If  we  can
learn  from  the  charts  at  what  points  to  buy  and  under  what  conditions  to
sell,  we  have  acquired  the  basic  machinery  for  successful  trading.  On  the
other hand, obviously, if your buying and selling are at points which more
often than not result in net losses, then it makes no difference how you divide
up your capital or apply it in the market, for it will be bound to shrink until,

situation should set a benchmark. He should decide that if he loses 50% of his capital,
he will quit trading and put his money in mutual funds. They can certainly do no
worse than that.

The  ﬁrst  problem,  then,  is  to  learn  to  use  the  technical  tools,  patterns,
trends, Supports, Resistances, etc. Then we can consider how much money
we will risk and in what way.

We  have  already  seen  that  it  makes  a  difference,  sometimes  a  great
difference,  how  we  apply  our  capital.  The  various  factors  of  price  level,
sensitivity, and margin enter into the concept we are going to call the Com-
posite  Leverage  Index.  In  the  latter  part  of  this  chapter,  we  will  give  a
deﬁnition of this. Meanwhile, we have said enough so you will understand
what we are driving at if we use the term in connection with your market
commitments.

You realize, of course, that you do not want to be so conservative that
you will rule out practically all opportunities for making gains. If you decide
never to oppose the Primary Trend, you will have to be inactive during long
Secondary  Trends,  and  may  be  left  waiting,  sometimes  for  weeks  on  end,
for a continuation of the Primary Move. Naturally, you will pass up all weak
signals and convergent trends, and shun new commitments after very active
blow-offs or Panic Climaxes. You could, no doubt, carry your reﬁnement of
caution  so  far  that  your  percentage  of  success,  instead  of  being  a  mere  60,
70, or 80%, might approach 90%; you might actually be right 95% of the time
in your decisions. But this extreme conservatism would also mean that you
would  trade  only  in  the  very  ﬁnest  possible  situations,  when  every  factor

was  clean-cut  and  favorable. You  would  not  have  such  opportunities  very
often.  The  result  might  be  a  proﬁt,  but  too  small  a  proﬁt  to  justify  all  the
work and study you would be putting into your charts — for you can obtain
nominally respectable returns on your capital without very much study and
without much risk, and you must expect a much higher rate of return if your
efforts are to be worthwhile.

EN: These “nominally respectable” returns are obtained by investing in T Bonds
and  similar  instruments.  Bond  traders  and  investors  traditionally  consider  these
investments “risk free,” which is, of course, another form of the denial of reality. In
reality  as  David  Dreman  has  demonstrated,  bonds  are  a  wasting  asset  due  to  the
unarrestable deterioration in the commodity denominated value of currency. 

(EN: Portfolio Risk)

By maintaining your Composite Leverage 

In  order  to  put  your  charts  to  work,  you  have  to  avail  yourself  of  the
higher-leveraged stocks, stocks which carry more opportunity for gain and,
hence, more risk of loss. You have to accept, deliberately, a greater risk than
the man who is content to buy a “safe” security, put it in the box, and forget it.
 at or near
some  constant  level  which  your  experience  and  judgment  tells  you  is  safe
for the particular state of the market, you will be protected against overcau-
tion.  More  important,  if  you  maintain  this  Composite  Leverage  in  your
operations, you will be protected against unconsciously overtrading. This is
a fault more common than extreme caution, and can be a dangerous enemy
even when your percentage of theoretical trading gains is high. When you
select a deﬁnite Composite Leverage and adhere to it in your trading com-
mitments, changing it as necessary to meet changed conditions, you will be
forced to restrain your enthusiasm within safe limits, and you will be con-
tinually aware of the risks you are taking.

Overtrading — and a Paradox

This leads to another point. A series of identical percentage gains and losses
on your capital does not give you a series of equal gains and losses in dollars
and  cents.  This  is  a  serious  problem,  worth  understanding  —  for  a  trader
who  is  greatly  overextended  is  intensifying  this  problem  (which  exists  in
any case, but which does not need to cause him too much worry if he has
planned his program).

You can understand the paradoxical statement that percentage gains and
losses  are  not  equal  if  you  take  the  extreme  case,  ﬁrst,  of  a  man,  who,  in
every business venture he enters, risks his entire capital with the expectation
of either a 100% gain or a 100% loss. If this ﬁrst venture is a loss, he loses
100%. He is ﬁnished, because he cannot gain by making 100% on nothing.
However, if the ﬁrst venture is successful and he then uses his entire capital,
including the new proﬁts, again on the same terms, and the second venture
is a failure, he will be wiped out completely. No matter how many successes

Resources (Appendix D) for the formula.

In  a  lesser  degree,  this  is  the  situation  we  are  speaking  of. You  would
not risk all of your capital on a basis of doubling your money or losing all.
But  suppose  you  were  extended,  continually,  to  a  point  where  you  were
taking the risk of a 40% net loss on each transaction, with the hope of a 40%
net  gain.  Should  you  start  with  $1000  and  have  a  succession  of  10  losses,
you would wind up with about $6. Now suppose the very next 10 transac-
tions  were  all  successful.  You  would  ﬁnally  come  out,  after  10  losses  and
10 gains, each of 40%, with capital of less than $100. It would not be necessary
either that these 10 losses and 10 gains come in the order given. You might
have the 10 gains ﬁrst, or three gains, four losses, seven gains, and then six
losses. The result would be the same. After 10 gains and losses, in any order,
you would have lost more than 90% of your capital.

On  the  other  hand,  if  you  risked  your  entire  capital  each  time  on
20 ventures,  in  10  of  which  you  took  an  8%  net  gain  and  in  10  an  8%  net
loss, your $1000 after the 10 gains and losses would be reduced only to $937.
You  would  still  have  about  94%  of  your  original  capital.  Therefore,  in  this
case (and 8% is a fair average ﬁgure for short-term transactions resulting in
a  loss,  in  fact,  a  rather  liberal  ﬁgure  according  to  extensive  tabulations  of
actual transactions), you would have a handicap due to this paradox of only

that would be an unusual 
one period of 10 months between the actual turn of the market and the Dow
Signal  for  a  Reversal  of  the  Primary  Trend.  True,  the  resulting  new  trend,
once established, ran far and long, and would have made up all losses and
produced  ﬁne  proﬁts.  But  during  the  10  hard  months,  allowing  the  fair
average  time  of  30 days  per  transaction,  it  is  possible  that  10  successive
wrong-way  trades  might  have  been  stopped  out  for  losses,  reducing  the
original $1000 to $434.

The  important  thing  here  is  that  the  next  10  successful  trades  would
have brought this $434 back to $937; in other words, you could have righted
the boat and sailed right on if you were working on the 8% basis, whereas
if you had been following the 40% basis we gave previously as an example,
you would have been sunk without a trace, a victim of overtrading.

Therefore, by maintaining a sane Composite Leverage Index and letting
the law of averages work for you and with you, you will be on solid math-

Composite Leverage Index of a Single Stock

EN: original  Chapter 24,
If  you  keep  a  record  of  sensitivity  as  outlined  in  (
Chapter  A  of  this  Appendix)
  and  have  computed  the  Sensitivity  Indexes  for
your stocks, then you can set down the Composite Leverage of any purchase
or short sale as follows:

• Let 
• Let 

S
N

 represent the Sensitivity Index of the stock.
  represent  the  Normal  Range-for-Price,  based  on  the  price  at

the time of the original commitment.

• Let 

T

 represent the Total Net Paid or received on the original trans-

action.
C

• Let 

 represent the Capital reserved to ﬁnance this commitment. In
the  case  of  outright  cash  purchases  or  100%  margin  short  transac-
tions, this ﬁgure cancels out against 

 in the numerator.

T

Then

Composite Leverage = 

SNT
15.5 C×

(15.5 is the Normal Range for a stock selling at a price of 25, and is simply
an  arbitrary  selection  to  serve  as  a  ﬁxed  point  of  reference  in  determining
ratios.)

Composite Leverage on an Entire Portfolio

The Composite Leverage on the entire account is a summation of the risks
of the component stocks, and can be ﬁgured in this way:

Total Composite Leverage = 

Sum of SNT*
15.5 × TTotal Capital or Net Worth

*

Let us add one more striking example of the importance of Composite
Leverage. At a time when stocks could be bought on a 30% margin, it would
have been possible to buy, with $1000, $3300 worth of a highly speculative
stock, Standard Gas and Electric $4 Preferred, then listed on the New York
Stock Exchange. Let us assume that the price at that time was $25 a share.
The Composite Leverage, then, on your $1000 capital would be 693% using

the methods we have just outlined in determining this Composite Leverage.
At this same time, using the same methods of ﬁguring, an outright purchase
% 1st Preferred at 106 would give a Composite
of $1000 worth of Celanese 4
Leverage of only 11.8%. Comparing these two transactions, your purchase
of “SG Pr” provided a leverage of 693 to 11.8 as compared to the purchase
of “CZ 1st Pr” or approximately 60 to 1 (58.7 to 1). Presumably, and based
on the past history of the stocks, your chances of capital gain or loss were
about 60 times as great in the “SG Pr” as in the “CZ 1st Pr.”

The  method  proposed  here  gives  you  a  means  of  knowing  at  least
approximately how much risk you are assuming in a stock or in a group of
stocks. It can help you to avoid exposing yourself unwittingly to an inordi-
nate degree of risk or, on the other hand, restricting unduly your opportu-
nities for gain.

Investment Account Policy

Ordinarily,  investment  account  management  is  based  largely  on  consider-
ations of the “fundamentals,” and not to any great extent on technical indi-
cations.  Furthermore,  such  accounts  would  normally  be  set  up  on  a  more
conservative  basis,  and  would  not  try  to  use  Bear  Markets  for  short  sales.
EN: Magee refers here to what he considered “the long-term investor” or, one who
moved only when major fault lines shook — i.e., major changes in the Dow or some
such. As strikingly illustrated by the long-term record of the Dow in Chapter 5 and
5.1, this can be a successful strategy but this editor feels strongly that short sales
and Bear strategies ﬁt well with even the most conservative of investment portfolios.
MPT (implicitly) encourages it and any investor who had some shorts in his portfolio
on October 19, 1987 (or September 11, 2001), felt a lot better on following mornings
.
Nevertheless,  the  matter  of  Composite  Leverage  ﬁgured  on  the  entire
account  is  a  help  in  determining  the  overall  nature  of  the  investment.  It
would be a help in determining whether the account should be placed in a
more conservative position, or whether it could stand a change in the direc-
tion of somewhat more speculative holdings. These decisions would, natu-
rally, depend on the size of the account, the condition and requirements of
the  owner,  and  on  the  general  condition  of  business  and  the  market  itself.
However  the  Composite  Leverage  Index  will  provide  a  useful  gauge  for
appraising  the  character  of  the  account  as  a  whole  at  any  particular  time.
(EN9: Cf. Portfolio Operating Risk computations in Chapter 42.)

Negative Composite Leverage

From what we have said about the “insurance” function of short sales in a
Bull Market (and purchases in a Bear Market), where these “contrary” trans-
actions are used to achieve balance by means of the Evaluative Index, it must
be  clear  that  such  short  sales  or  protective  purchases  must  tend  to  reduce

the  Composite  Leverage  or  total  risk  of  the  account,  which  is  exactly  why
they would be used.

It might seem that by considering the contrary transactions as negative,
and those in line with the presumed Major Trend as positive, this sum could
be reduced to zero, or at least to a point where there was no substantial total
risk at all. This is not quite possible, since we are dealing, at best, with rough
approximations, and also because we are dealing with more or less indepen-
dent variables which may, and will, at times, make erratic moves.

EN: In fact, after the development of the Black–Scholes formula for calculating
options values, some very astute traders developed the “Delta Neutral” method of
arbitraging  options.  Among  the  most  sophisticated  of  these  was  Blair  Hull,  the
editor’s  boss  at  Options  Research,  Inc.  Delta  Neutral  means  that  over  very  short
time  periods  market  price  movement,  up  or  down,  should  not,  theoretically,  affect
the value of options arbitrage portfolios. Large fortunes have been made by market-
makers practicing this method. See Schwager’s books on the Market Wizards.

However, it is true that we can greatly reduce the total risk and that the

contrary moves do, in a real sense, “subtract” risk from the total account.

This  “subtraction”  of  risk  appears  in  commodity  accounts,  where  it  is
customary for brokers to reduce the margin required on total commitments
if some of these commitments are “contrary,” that is, if there are some shorts
along with a majority of long positions, or vice versa.

EN: Modern  Portfolio  Theorists  have  sagaciously  adopted  some  of  these  con-
cepts,  probably  like  the  Russians,  discovering  them  for  themselves  or  at  least  not
crediting Magee if they learned of the concepts from his work. Chapter 42 explores
the  idea  which  Magee  is  concerned  with  here  —  that  of  measuring  portfolio  risk
 proﬁt opportunity. He is concerned not just with risk but also with opportunity,
and
and maintaining a balance between them. He also wants to maintain a consistent
stance  to  the  market,  exposing  his  capital  to  most  risk  and  opportunity  when  he
analyzes the market to present most promise, and keeping a lower proﬁle at times
of uncertainty and at turning points.

The procedures presented here are still workable by the dedicated manual tech-
nician  and,  if  I  am  not  mistaken,  are  still  effective,  if  cumbersome  in  the  age  of
computers. All of the data, tables, and Indexes necessary are included in this Appen-
dix.  Computer-oriented  analysts  will  probably  ﬁnd  the  procedures  outlined  in  the
main sections of the book to be somewhat more convenient and also sufﬁcient.

Normal Range-for-Price Indexes

The ﬁgures in this table represent that particular component of the Composite
Leverage  of  a  stock  which  is  a  function  of  its  price  level.  They  are  based  on
actual tabulations from 3800 stock charts. They state the
 proportion or
percentage  range  of  movement  of  a  stock  in  each  price  range  through  an
average 6-month period.

Chapter D

Sensitivity Indexes of Stocks*

621

Although it is not possible to predict the advance or decline of a stock over
the  years  in  the  future,  it  is  possible  to  make  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the
most likely “degree” of advance or decline, based on its long-term market
history. Barring major changes in corporate structure or in the nature of the
company’s  product,  we  can  assume  that  the  relatively  conservative  stock
will usually continue to move conservatively, and that the relatively specu-
lative stock will continue to be subject to wide swings of advance or decline.
This  new  table  of  Sensitivity  Indexes  shows  the  approximate  relative
sensitivity of stocks, based on the percentage price range of each stock for
each year over the period from 1964 to 1973 inclusive, and the median price
of each stock in each year. The values are adjusted for major split-ups and
price level, and also for the overall range of the market in each year. For this
correction, we have used a Market Reciprocal which is inversely proportional
to the total price range of all the stocks considered, and this makes it possible
to set up the annual Sensitivity Indexes from which the 10-year ﬁgures used
in the table are obtained.

Since some students may want to work out their own relative sensitivity
ﬁgures or use this data in other ways, we are giving here the Market Recip-
rocals used for each of the years in these computations:

Magee’s Original Chapter 23
in the Fifth and Seventh Editions

The Mechanics of Building a Chart

You are now ready to start building your set of charts, which will in time,
if  faithfully  kept,  provide  you  with  an  invaluable  working  tool  or  “capital
asset.”

You have before you a supply of whatever type of chart paper you have
decided to use, the binder or binders for the charts, pencils, triangle, ruler,
and  the  stock  page  of  the  daily  newspaper.  You  will  have  these  things
arranged on a large, cleared, well-lighted working area; and you will be left
free  to  work  undisturbed.  You  have  already  chosen  the  list  of  stocks  you
intend to chart.

Fill  out  a  chart  form  for  each  stock.  In  the  upper  left-hand  corner,  put
the dates covered by the 52 weeks or whatever period of time is to be covered
by the chart sheet. It would be a good idea, right from the start, to divide
your  charts  into  four  groups. All  stocks  from A  to  C  inclusive  might  have
chart sheets dated January through December 1957, for example (if you are
using the full-year charting paper), followed on their completion by sheets
dated January through December 1958. Then all stocks from D to I inclusive
will  be  on  charts  dated April  1957  through  March  1958,  and  these  will  be
followed  on  their  completion  by  sheets  dated  April  1958  through  March
1959.  Similarly,  a  third  group  will  include  stocks  from  J  through  R,  dated
July 1957 through June 1958, and a fourth group will include the remaining
issues from S through Z, dated October 1957 through September 1958. Thus,
each 3 months, a quarter of your charts will run out and call for new pages,
and at no time will all your charts come to the ends of their sheets simulta-
neously.  If  the  date  on  which  you  are  starting  a  chart  happens  to  fall  in
August, set up the sheet dated as for other stocks in its alphabetical group,
leaving blank whatever months lie before the start of your chart. Then you
will  be  on  the  right  track  from  the  beginning  and  will  never  have  any
confusion as to the dating of chart sheets.

Put the name of the company in the title space at the center of the top;
put the dates covered by the sheet to the left, and the ticker symbol to the
right.  Then  ﬁll  in  the  scale  of  prices  on  the  vertical  left  margin.  If  you  are
using arithmetic paper, you can simply write the ﬁgures representing prices

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

up and down from the center, letting the center come at or near the stock’s
market  price  at  the  time  of  starting  the  chart.  With  square-root  paper  or
logarithmic (ratio) paper, place the scale, so that the center of the paper will
  if  you  are  using  the
be  as  near  as  possible  to  the  present  price.  (
TEKNIPLAT  chart  paper,  which  is  a  ratio  paper,  you  will  ﬁnd  a  detailed
outline  of  procedure  in Appendix  B,  Section  2,  though  if  you  are  familiar
with ratio scale, you will have no difﬁculty in setting up the chart.)

Note:

From chart examples in this book, you will see how charts may be titled,
dated, and scaled. You will also notice that on sheets especially printed for
charting  stock  prices,  each  sixth  vertical  line  is  somewhat  heavier  than  its
neighbors; this represents a Saturday, on which you will have no entry since
the  market  does  not  operate  on  Saturday.  However,  this  slight  break  each
week will not affect your trends and other technical indications materially,
and serves to provide a space between the weeks, making it easier for the
eye to pick out a particular day of the week quickly in charting. It is impor-
tant  to  make  your  ﬁrst  entry  on  the  correct  vertical  line  for  the  day  of  the
week, so that the ending of the ﬁrst week will come on a “Saturday” line. If
a month should start on Monday, start your chart on the ﬁrst line immedi-
ately to the right of the left border. If the month should start on Thursday,
begin  three  small  spaces  farther  to  the  right,  so  that  Saturday  falls  on  the
ﬁrst heavier line.

Finally, you will have a volume scale near the bottom of the chart and
a time scale along the very bottom showing the date of each Saturday over
the period covered by the chart sheet.

There are four ﬁgures you must pick up for charting from the newspaper
you are following. At ﬁrst, you will ﬁnd it necessary to look back and forth
several  times,  taking  the  high,  low,  closing  price,  and  day’s  volume  sepa-
rately.  With  practice,  and  by  making  a  conscious  effort  to  train  your  eyes
and  mind,  you  will  ﬁnd  it  possible  to  grasp  the  four  ﬁgures  in  one  single
“grab,” ﬁxing them in your mind for the few seconds it takes to mark them
in on the chart sheet. This knack, when you have mastered it, can cut down
the time needed for charting 50% or more; it is well worth a bit of extra effort.

Holidays–Ex-Dividend Days

When a holiday occurs or when for any reason the market is closed, simply
skip that day, leaving blank the space (vertical line) where you would have
entered  it.  When  there  are  no  sales  of  a  stock  on  a  particular  day,  mark  a
small  “0”  in  the  volume  scale.  If  you  happen  to  be  watching  a  particular
situation in a stock closely, you might want to indicate by a dotted line the
approximate  level  between  the  closing  bid  and  the  offer  prices  on  the  day
no sale occurred. But there is no need to make this a regular procedure.

Ex-dividend dates can be indicated by an “x” along the bottom margin
of  the  volume  scale,  and  any  data  about  dividends  can  then  be  written  in

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AU3772_book.fm  Page 631  Saturday, November 18, 2006  5:29 PM

on  the  extreme  bottom  margin;  for  example,  “$.5D  Unchanged  Quarterly”
or “Payable in American funds, $1.00.” Or the amount of the dividend may
be written in vertically right on the face of the chart on the line representing
the  ex-dividend  date.  Stock  dividends  and  rights  should  be  entered  in  the
same way, and their market value indicated. When stocks go ex-dividend,
especially if the dividend is a large one, there may be a price gap which can
sometimes appear to change or spoil a technical chart pattern. An Ex-Divi-
dend Gap is not a signiﬁcant gap in the technical sense, and if it is no larger
than  the  amount  of  the  dividend  (or  rights  or  other  beneﬁt),  it  may  be
disregarded.  The  newspaper  tabulation  of  stock  prices  takes  this  into
 of
account. For example, if a stock goes ex-dividend 50 cents and closes 
a  point  lower  than  the  previous  day,  the  paper  will  report  the  stock  “plus
⅛

⅜

⅜

” not “minus 

.”

In the case of Ex-Dividend Caps, you may, if you wish, extend the price
range of the stock by a dotted line equal to the amount of the dividend; and
you should, on the day of ex-dividend or similar distribution, move down
stop-order levels, limit orders, trendlines, etc. Very often the stock will con-
tinue  in  the  (adjusted)  pattern  or  trend  even  though  its  level  has  been
changed on the ex-dividend day.

Stock  split-ups  or  other  changes  in  capitalization  cause  extra  work  in
charting. Where the split is two-for-one or four-for-one, there is no problem
because  the  entire  scale  from  that  point  on  is  simply  changed  to  the  new
price  by  halving  or  quartering  each  horizontal  line’s  previous  value.  You
rescale  the  chart  and  continue.  The  chart  may,  and  probably  will,  become
more active as to volume (because of the larger number of shares outstand-
ing)  and  may  develop  “coarser  texture”  in  its  patterns  from  this  point  on,
but it will respect the (adjusted) Resistance and Support Levels, trends, etc.,
previously established. Where a split-up is not 2-for-1 or 4-for-1, but some
odd  ﬁgure  such  as  3-for-1  or  4-for-7,  you  will  usually  have  to  start  a  new
sheet, plotting the chart at the new prices, and then extending it back a few
, and plotting them on
weeks by dividing the previous prices by 3 or by 
the new scale.

You may ﬁnd it convenient to mark on your charts special information
on certain companies — purchases of subsidiaries, reduction of bond issues,
earnings  or  other  important  data  —  although,  in  this  work,  we  do  not
concentrate on these “fundamental” matters, but on the chart itself.

When the Chart Goes Off the Paper

When  one  of  your  stocks  which  has  been  selling  in  the  neighborhood  of
20 moves up close to 40 and appears likely to rise through 40, it will be well
to  rescale  the  center  of  the  chart  at  40.  For  a  time,  you  can  chart  the  stock
on  both  scales  simultaneously,  so  that  if  it  should  proceed  up  through  the
40 level, you will have a few weeks of the chart in centered position all ready

to  continue.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  stock  recedes  to  35  or  so,  the  new
auxiliary chart may be dropped for the time being. Naturally, when such a
situation exists, where you are carrying the same stock on two scales simul-
taneously, the next following chart sheet will be scaled to continue only the
chart on which the price trend is nearer the center of the paper.

The Chart Record of Transactions

It would be possible to give a good deal of space to the interesting study of
“paper  accounts”  in  which  theoretical  trades  are  marked  and  recorded  on
the  charts,  without  actually  making  commitments  in  real  cash.  Detailed
suggestions  for  this  work  were  outlined,  and  it  was  planned  to  include  a
chapter on the subject, but the authors decided that very few readers would
be willing to carry out the detailed study, records, and analysis which, to be
of any value, would require as much work as actual trading.

However, it should be pointed out that anyone who contemplates further
research or original work in technical analysis, or who intends to make his
career in the stock market, will need a great many more cases for tabulation
than his own actual trades will supply. He will need hundreds of situations
in order to strike an average, so that he can say, “This particular idea seems
to  work  out  in  75%  of  the  cases,”  or,  “That  plan  does  not  provide,  on  the
average, enough gain to justify the risk and the costs of taxes, commissions,
etc.”

The important thing about theoretical trading is that the buying or selling
points should be clearly marked on the chart before the expected move has
occurred, and theoretical orders should be assumed to have been executed
exactly as they would have been in a broker’s ofﬁce, with proper deduction
made  from  the  ﬁnal  gross  gain  (or  additions  to  the  loss)  to  cover  broker’s
commissions, odd-lot fractions, dividends or rights received, and (in case of
short  sales)  dividends  or  rights  paid.  It  does  not  pay  to  cheat  at  solitaire,
and the only possible value of such “paper trading” is a record of experience
that represents exactly what would have happened in an actual account.

By recording every promising situation and the action to be taken as it
unfolds, an analyst will maintain an alertness to possible opportunities for
actual trading. He will be ready to seize opportunities as they appear, and
he  will  acquire  conﬁdence  as  he  sees  his  own  predictions  materializing.  If
he keeps a careful and honest record of his theoretical trades, and tabulates
all of these on the completion of each series of charts, he will have a yardstick
for studying his own improvement, and the comparison between his theo-
retical work and his actual results. Furthermore, he will have source material
for almost any type of advanced research he may want to delve into.

For the beginner (although these words will fall mostly on deaf ears), it
will  pay  to  make  all  trades  “on  paper”  for  a  number  of  months  before
venturing any actual capital in the market. If good opportunities for proﬁt
occur, there is no need to feel that this or that situation is the last good chance

the  market  will  offer.  The  market  will  be  there  next  month  and  next  year;
there  will  be  other  opportunities  just  as  good.  Meanwhile,  it  is  possible  to
appraise  a  situation,  indicate  what  you  would  like  to  do,  and  study  what
subsequently happens. If only more novices had the patience to experiment
in this way for a time before risking their money, they could avoid many of
the pitfalls and traps that so often lead to losses and discouragement.

Supplementary Memoranda on the Chart

There  are  several  special  marks  to  go  on  the  chart  which  should  be  men-
tioned. We have already spoken of keeping (on the chart itself) a record of
possible buys and sells, and of theoretical trades — when bought, when sold,
time  of  holding,  net  gain  or  loss  after  commissions  and  after  dividends,
etc. You should also record any actual purchases or sales, noting the num-
ber of shares, price, broker (if you carry more than one account), etc. This
record  can  be  kept  near  the  top  of  the  sheet,  perhaps  in  blue  if  long  and
red  if  short,  extending  from  the  date  of  original  commitment  to  the  date
of closing out.

On starting a new (continuation) chart sheet, transfer to its left margin
any  notes  as  to  actual  or  theoretical  commitments  that  are  still  open,  stop
orders, etc. Also, it would be a good idea to mark all sheets covering a certain
52-week period with an identifying series number or letter (“A,” “B,” etc.)
in  the  upper  left  corner.  This  would  make  it  easy  to  reﬁle  charts  in  their
proper chronological folder after they have been taken out for study.

In  the  left-hand  margin,  at  the  proper  price  levels,  mark  the  highest
closing  price  of  the  previous  sheet  with  a  dotted  blue  line. Also  mark  the
lowest closing price of the previous page with a dotted red line. These levels
give  you  important  high  and  low  points,  violation  of  which  often  means
important  further  moves  in  the  same  direction.  They  also  give  you  the
“range” of the stock in the preceding 52-week period, which is essential in
ﬁguring its velocity, or what we call the sensitivity of the stock during that
period. We will use this range in making the longer-term Sensitivity Index
which is a factor in determining Composite Leverage ratios.

One  last  point  on  chart  mechanics:  the  longer  you  keep  a  record  of  a
stock, the more useful your chart will be. Do not make unnecessary changes
in your chart portfolio, but add and drop stocks only gradually and when
you feel certain the change will improve the group. When you ﬁrst start a
new chart, mark it “New,” showing that it is an addition to your portfolio.
Then you will not waste time later on looking for a previous sheet on that
stock. Also, a new chart may well have to be carried along for a number of
weeks  or  even  months  before  you  have  enough  deﬁnite  chart  information
to enable you to trade in it. If it seems desirable to make a commitment in
a  stock  you  do  not  now  chart,  it  would  be  best  to  run  back  a  chart  for  at
least  3  months  from  your  ﬁles  of  the  ﬁnancial  pages,  which  we  hope  you
cherish and keep to meet just this need.

Section 2
TEKNIPLAT Chart Paper

If you have never kept charts on this type of paper, known as semilogarith-
mic, ratio, or proportion, these instructions will help you to read and under-
stand the charts more easily, and they will help you in getting started if you
are setting up charts of your own.

There will be no problem here for the engineer or the experienced char-
tist, but many people who have not kept charts before, or who are familiar
only with the arithmetic price scale where the intervals are uniform through-
out, may be puzzled at ﬁrst by the continually changing vertical spaces. As
you  will  discover,  however,  this  very  feature  makes  for  easier  and  faster
charting, because the various prices always lie at the same point in one of
the “banks,” and the eye becomes adept in placing the point needed auto-
matically, without reference to the index ﬁgures along the left margin.

On many simple charts, showing hours of work, temperature changes,
depth of water, etc., it is perfectly satisfactory to use ordinary cross-section
paper,  so  that  each  “hour,”  “degree,”  or  “foot”  is  represented  by  the  same
vertical  distance  on  the  chart.  The  difference  between  5  feet  and  10  feet  is
the same as the distance between 105 feet and 110 feet.

But this is not a good way to represent the differences in stock prices. It
is perfectly true that the difference in market value between a stock selling
at  $5  a  share  and  one  selling  at  $10  a  share  is  $5,  or  $500  on  a  block  of
100 shares. And  that  the  difference  between  the  value  of  a  stock  selling  at
100  and  one  at  105  is  also  $5,  or  $500  on  a  block  of  100  shares.  But  in  this
latter case, there is a great deal more of your capital involved.

%.

For  example,  if  you  put  $1000  into  a  stock  at  5,  you  would  get  (disre-
garding  commission)  200  shares.  And  if  you  sold  these  at  10,  you  would
receive  $2000.  You  would  have  a  proﬁt  of  $1000,  or  100%.  But  if  you  put
your $1000 into a stock selling at 105, you would be able to buy only 9 shares.
And when you sold ﬁve points higher at 110, your proﬁt would be only $45,
or 4

½
It will give you a better comparison of the percentages of proﬁt in various
stock transactions if the price scale of your chart is designed to show equal
percentages of advance or decline of equal vertical distances, regardless of
the price of the stock. This is exactly what the TEKNIPLAT charting paper
does. A certain vertical distance on the paper will always indicate the same
percentage change, and a trend moving at a certain angle will always indicate
the  same  rate  of  percentage  change,  no  matter  what  the  price  of  the  stock
may be.

Obviously, one point of advance or decline is much more important to
you  in  a  stock  selling  at  $5  or  $6  a  share  than  in  one  selling  at  $100.  So  it
should  not  surprise  you  that  the  interval  between  5  and  6  is  much  larger
than that between 100 and 101. And since the stocks at lower prices make
larger  percentage  moves  for  each  point,  or  half  point,  or  one-eighth  point,
these  moves  will  show  up  more  plainly  on  their  charts. Actually,  it  is  not
possible on the TEKNIPLAT paper to show a single eighth of change for a
stock  selling  as  high  as  100.  But  this  is  just  another  way  of  saying  that  a
single  eighth  is  not  important  at  that  price.  You  might  well  be  concerned
about the difference between 1

whether you sold at 103 or 103

Since  all  your  stocks  will  be  plotted  on  a  proportion  basis,  you  can
compare  directly  the  action  of  any  one  stock  with  any  other  as  to  pattern,
trend, etc. Thus, a stock selling at 16 can be compared with a stock selling
at 56. However, although the percentage moves will be strictly comparable,
it  should  be  pointed  out  that,  typically,  the  very  high-priced  issues  make
smaller percentage moves than the low-priced ones.

The price scale on TEKNIPLAT paper consists of two “banks,” occupying
the  upper  and  lower  halves  of  the  main  chart  space.  These  two  banks  are
exactly alike. Each represents a doubling of prices from its bottom to its top,
so  that  whatever  value  is  assigned  to  the  center  line,  the  top  line  will  be
twice that ﬁgure and the bottom line will be half of it. Let us say the center
point is marked 20; then the top will be 40, and the 9 Intermediate lines will
be 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, and 38, reading from center to top, with each
¼
of  the  smallest  spaces  representing 
  point.  In  the  lower  half  of  the  chart,
the bottom line will be 10, the Intermediate heavy lines to the center will be
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19, and each of the smallest spaces will be
⅛
  point.  Since  the  spaces  get  smaller  as  one  goes  up  the  chart,  one  bank
shades into the next, making a continuous scale. Obviously, you could have
20 at the top, 10 at the center, and 5 at the bottom; or 10 at the top, 5 at the
center, and 2

 at the bottom.

At ﬁrst you may have some trouble with the different values assigned
to  the  small  spaces  at  different  price  levels;  you  may  wonder  whether  a
 or perhaps a full point. Do not let this
single small space represents 
bother  you.  You  can  see  from  the  scale  where  19  is  and  where  20  is,  and
obviously 19
 is one quarter of the way up, and so on.
Very  quickly,  you  will  ﬁnd  that  your  mind  and  your  eye  adjust  almost
instantly without any conscious thought or effort.

Where  a  stock  goes  off  the  top  or  bottom  of  the  paper,  it  is  a  simple
matter to rescale by moving the chart scale down one bank. If the chart runs
off  the  top  at  40,  mark  the  center  of  the  paper  40;  from  then  on,  the  top
becomes 80 and the bottom, 20.

For uniformity, and because the paper is ruled to divide either bank of
the heavy Intermediate lines into 10 parts, with smaller spaces representing
standard stock-trading fractions of these main divisions, you must use the
ﬁgures 5, 10, 20, etc., as the values for the center lines, tops, and bottoms of

Note:

  This  table  can,  of  course,  be  continued  up  or  down  as  far  as

necessary by multiplying or dividing the key ﬁgures by two.

The Time Scale

The  paper  provides  for  a  full  year  of  charting.  The  sheet  is  divided  into
53 weeks,  each  consisting  of  6  days  in  which  the  heavier  line  represents  a
Saturday,  and  this  is  ordinarily  left  blank  since  the  major  markets  are  not
open on Saturday. However, the heavier line will serve to make it easier to
locate a day within a week, quickly. The omission of the Saturday will not
perceptibly affect the trend of the technical patterns.

Holidays, when they occur, are skipped. Usually, a small “H” is inserted
at the bottom of the chart to note the holiday and explain the break in the
chart.

Many technicians start their charts as of the ﬁrst of a calendar year, ﬁlling
in the dates of Saturdays marking the end of each week at the bottom of the
paper  in  the  spaces  provided,  and  immediately  above  these  dates,  the
months.  There  is  no  reason,  however,  that  charts  cannot  be  started  at  any
time, and if you keep a large number of charts, it may be a help to start some
of these in each calendar quarter. Thus, you might start all charts from A to
F in January, from G to M in April, from N to S in July, and from T to Z in
October.

The  volume  scale  that  has  proved  most  satisfactory  is  arithmetic,  that
is,  each  unit  measured  vertically  represents  the  same  number  of  shares
traded. Space for volume entries is provided in a special section above the
dates. At  one  time,  a  logarithmic  volume  scale  was  used,  but  it  was  given
up because the highly signiﬁcant volumes on very active days tended to be
compressed, while low volume in periods of dullness was given too much
emphasis.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

It is necessary to determine the proper ﬁgures for the volume scale. No
rule for this can be suggested. It is simply a matter of trial and error. With
a little experience, you will be able to estimate, from your knowledge of the
stock you are about to chart, about how much volume is likely to appear on
very active days, and you can set up a volume scale that will allow for the
maximum  expected  peak.  What  you  want  to  avoid  is  the  situation  where
volume too frequently runs beyond the top of the volume section; it should
do this only at times of unusual activity.

Where a stock is new to you, and you have no knowledge of its habits,
it may be best to mark a tentative volume scale, lightly and in pencil, and
keep  the  volume  on  this  scale  for  a  few  weeks.  Then  if  it  is  necessary  to
change the scale, you can do so without having to draw the entire chart over.

Ex-Dividends and Split-Ups

When  a  stock  goes  “ex-dividend,”  “ex-rights,”  etc.,  the  price  will  usually
drop approximately the amount of the beneﬁt that was “ex.” A note should
be  made  on  the  chart  on  this  day,  and  this  can  be  entered  conveniently  at
the  very  bottom,  below  the  dates,  showing  the  amount  of  the  dividend,
approximate  value  of  the  rights,  or  other  beneﬁts.  If  the  amount  involved
was substantial and the price drop is large enough to require explanation,
a dotted line may be drawn vertically on that date from the old price to the
“ex” price, showing that this drop was not a market ﬂuctuation, but merely
the adjustment of price to the distribution.

In  the  case  of  a  split-up,  spin-off,  or  other  capital  change,  a  similar
procedure is followed. If the stock is split three-shares-for one, for example,
the price level will change, and the chart will be continued at a new level.
A  dotted  vertical  line  plus  an  explanatory  note  will  make  clear  what  hap-
pened.  In  order  to  get  continuity  of  the  chart  in  such  a  case,  the  previous
price  pattern  can  be  traced  and  then  transferred  with  carbon  paper  in  the
correct position to give a continuous chart adjusted to the new basis for as
far back as you need it.

However, if a stock is split two-shares-for-one or four-for-one, you will
not have to make any change in the chart except to note the fact on the split,
and to change the scale by dividing all ﬁgures by 2 or 4, as the case may be.
In other words, if a stock has been selling at 80 and is split 2-for-1, we simply
rescale the chart with the price at 40 and carry on. Very often it will help to
rule a vertical red line through the date on which a split-up or other capital
adjustment takes effect.

Technical Analysis of Futures Charts 
(Using Number Driven Methods)

EN: This Appendix is an edited version of Chapter 16 from the seventh edition by
the redoubtable editor of that edition, Richard McDermott. It will serve as a handy
brief introduction to some of the concepts of number-driven analysis. For an excellent
(and highly recommended) work on the technical analysis of futures see Jack Schwager’s
On Futures, Technical Analysis.

EN9: The reader should understand clearly the purpose and intent of this Appendix
and of all treatments of number-driven methods in this book. This Appendix is not
intended  to  be  a  comprehensive  treatment  of  number-driven  technical  analysis  in
the  futures  area.  It  is  presented  to  give  the  reader  a  brief  survey  of  some  of  the
methods used by this breed of analysts. The original authors of this work (and the
present  editor)  were  and  are  chart  analysts  and  practitioners  of  natural  systems.
AND I believe that the methods presented here can be better used when practiced
by a competent chart analyst.

Commodities Futures

Futures (a standardized instrument allowing the investor to buy at current
prices  for  future  delivery)  are  traded  on  commodities  such  as  agricultural
products  (e.g.,  corn,  oats,  wheat,  soybeans,  livestock);  metals  (e.g.,  gold,
silver,  platinum,  palladium);  forest,  ﬁber,  and  food  (e.g.,  lumber,  cotton,
orange juice, sugar, cocoa, coffee); energy, (e.g., crude oil, heating oil, gaso-
line,  natural  gas);  ﬁnancial  and  other  derivative  markets  (e.g.,  debt  instru-
ments such as U.S. Treasury Bonds, stock indexes, currencies).

The futures industry began in the United States in the early 1800s as a
way to stabilize crop producers’ and buyers’ incomes by locking in a current
commodity price for delivery at a later date. As the futures market developed
and became standardized, the primary investment strategies of hedging and
speculation evolved. Trading of futures and options has expanded to numer-
ous types of investment products and, in recent years, has become global.
Empirical experience demonstrates that chart patterns exist for equity

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

the  constraints  of  supply  and  demand,  also  illustrate  meaningful  patterns
when plotted on a graph. Rising or Declining Trends, Congestion, Consoli-
dation, and Reversals will be evident, similar to the pattern formation created
by shares of common stock. Activities of the speculators and the underlying
investor  psychology  are  similar,  whether  the  securities  are  stock  shares  or
futures contracts.

Principles  of  technical  analysis  apply  to  any  of  the  active  commodity
futures such as: corn, cotton, cocoa, coffee, wheat, and others. Some allow-
ance must be made for the intrinsic differences between commodity futures
contracts and equity stocks or bonds, of which four are noted here.

1. Limited Life — One of the most prominent differences is the fact that
commodity  futures  have  a  limited  life;  they  expire  on  a  set  date.
Although  each  futures  contract  has  a  certain  life  of  its  own,  it  will
tend  to  trade  in  a  pattern  similar  to  cash  for  delivery  prices  and
similar to other comparable contracts. The limited independent life
has consequences of long-term Support and Resistance Levels which
have less value for analysis, although they have some value for the
short term.

2. Hedging — Another important difference between commodity and
stock  analysis  is  the  fact  that  many  investors  are  using  futures  for
hedging, a conservative strategy, rather than speculating. The result
of this situation is the fact that near-term levels of Support or Resis-
tance have less meaning than with equities. Futures with commodi-
ties  grown  as  crops  can  also  have  seasonal  inﬂuences  which  are
observed and evaluated by both hedgers and speculators. Seasonal
factors can have an effect on the reliability of signals in the technical
analysis of commodities.

3. Volume — A third major difference is volume. Volume’s relation to
stock  trading  is  not  complex. A  speciﬁc  number  of  shares  exist  for
trading.  Changes  in  the  total  number  of  shares  available  must  go
through an approval process and be well publicized. Average daily
volumes can be calculated and used as a benchmark to show sudden
increases or declines. With futures, there is virtually no limit to the
total  number  of  contracts  which  can  be  bought  or  sold  for  future
delivery  on  any  one  commodity,  although  there  are  limits  on  the
number  of  contracts  a  single  investor  can  buy  or  sell  on  a  speciﬁc
futures  contract.  It  is  possible  for  the  open  interest  to  exceed  the
amount of an underlying commodity actually delivered. In fact, most
contracts are closed out before the delivery date.

4. Weather  —  A  ﬁnal  major  difference  is  the  fact  that  weather  news
regarding such things as droughts, ﬂoods, etc., can impact the com-
modity crop and change the trend of the futures market immediately
and  dramatically.  The  stock  market  has  few  such  inﬂuences.

price declines areas of Support become Resistance. Note the Support Line from early
November,  well  into  December.  (See  Chapters 13  and  30  for  more  on  Support  and
Resistance.)

Observable Patterns

With the differences accounted for, under normal market conditions, chart
patterns can still be observed and used for analysis of commodities, as they
are used with common stocks, such as:

• Head-and-Shoulder Formations
• Rounding Tops and Bottoms

Basic Trendlines can be observed and plotted. Other patterns, common
with  equities,  like  Triangles,  Rectangles,  Flags,  etc.,  appear  less  frequently
in  commodities  and  tend  to  be  unreliable  in  forecasting  many  directional
changes of some commodity futures prices. Support and Resistance Levels
seem to be accurate at times and insigniﬁcant at other times (probably due
to supply and demand factors outside the patterns established by hedge and
speculative trading). Price gaps also seem to have less meaning.

Triangle  patterns  occur  less  frequently  in  commodities  and  aren’t  as
reliable as with equities, but they do occur. Breaks tend to be stronger initially
when  they  do  not  occur  at  the  apex  of  the  Triangle,  which  is  the  same
tendency as with stock chart patterns.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Successful speculation in commodities futures requires an extensive back-
ground in understanding the inﬂuences on their prices. Although chart patterns
can be observed, as shown here, reliability of signals due to inherent differences
between stocks and commodities should be approached with caution.

Importance of Stop-Loss Orders

A stop-loss order is a closing transaction for an open order. It is an order to
sell at the current market price, if the stop price is traded on or through, or
if the opening transaction was a buy (long position). It is an order to buy at
the current market price, if the stop price is traded on or through or if the
opening transaction was a sell (short position).

Whereas stop orders are much debated in the equities market, any pro-
fessional  commodities  trader  will  acknowledge  their  importance  to  avoid
catastrophic losses. The 1990s served witness to incidents where public and
private  institutions  lost  billions  of  dollars  in  the  futures  and  other  deriva-
tives. Where were their stop-loss orders? The essential stop-loss order is an
insurance policy which should be considered part of the cost of doing busi-
ness.

An ideal stop-loss is placed far enough away from the current trading
range in order to not be activated by normal market ﬂuctuations, yet be there
for a Major Reversal. But, the market is not an ideal universe. Reality says
the orders will be placed too close or too far away. Of those two alternatives,
too  far  away  is  preferable  for  many.  Too  close  leads  to  frustration  and
increased transaction costs. Left with only two alternatives, most investors
would lean toward the least frustrating, that of being too far away. Multiple
transactions can also cause confusion and thereby increase risk.

The too-far-away stop can be further honed and reﬁned by mathematical
analysis (e.g., standard deviation) or simple observation of the chart pattern,
including levels of Support and Resistance. Placing the stop-loss away from
current trading will cause the order to be activated only if trading violates
the range. The too-far-away method can be improved with practice. These
distant stops do avoid reentry problems as well as keep slippage and trans-
action  fees  under  control;  however,  the  overall  portfolio  risk  is  greater.
Whichever system is used, the primary caution is to avoid switching back
and forth between too close and too far away. In some markets, ﬂip-ﬂopping
could  easily  lead  to  whipsawing  by  cutting  proﬁts  both  ways.  (See
Chapter 27, Stop Orders.)

Weekly Charts

The  detail  of  the  daily  price  chart  is  important,  but  it  is  also  important  to
double-check the daily chart by comparing it to the weekly or monthly price
chart. The longer-term charts give “the bigger picture” and help to explain
the  development  of  current  trends.  “The  Trend  Is  Your  Friend”  can  be  as
true in commodities trading as it is in equity trading.

FIGURE  181.
Corn  Futures,  March  1997.  Although  the  patterns  shown  here  are
clear, there is a possibility that the downturn in July is the end of a Broad Head-and-
Shoulders  Pattern  (including  the  head  and  right  shoulder).  Notice  the  decline  in
volume  during August.  The  lower  volume  is  possibly  under  a  right  shoulder.  It  is
important to determine if this was from a Head-and-Shoulders Formation (see weekly
chart Figure 183). Triangle formations here seem to be quite accurate. (See Chapter 8
for  more  on  Triangles  and  Chapters 14,  15,  and  40  for  more  on  trendlines.)  Notice
how the Downtrend Line aligns itself with the apex of a Triangle. Chart courtesy of
Market Research, Inc. (www.barchart.com).

Trends

Trends  usually  endure  for  comparatively  long  periods  of  time  and  a  trading
position that doesn’t ﬁght the trend ordinarily does better. As with equity chart
patterns, Uptrend Lines are drawn under the lows and Downtrend Lines are
drawn across the highs. Many chartists draw trendlines on both sides of the
trend to indicate the Trading Channel. Trendlines can be drawn through highs
and lows or through closing prices shown by the dots on the right side of each
high–low bar (a dot to the left of a high–low bar indicates an opening price).
If a commodity trendline isn’t broken, it remains, usually until at least two
closing breaks occur. Many times a market will go sideways near the Bottom
of a downtrend. The sideways trend gives traders time to believe the down-
trend is over. For this reason they appear most often at the Bottom, and, the
longer Consolidating sideways trends continue, the stronger the next rally will
be.  False  turns  happen  most  often  at  the  Top  where  everyone  gets  nervous.
Although the most reliable trendlines move at or near a 45-degree angle, any
trendline running consistently for more than 4 weeks tends to continue.

more history to a trend, it will look at cash prices instead of futures prices, simply
because of the narrowly deﬁned futures life which has a beginning and an end. The
trend in the 1996 market was unmistakably Bullish. After the July correction Resis-
tance  was  continually  penetrated  and  Support  held  ﬁrm  until  December.  The  De-
cember break was signiﬁcant, but, at this point, appears to be a correction and not
necessarily  a  Reversal.  (See  Chapters 14,  15,  and  40  for  more  on  trendlines.)  Chart

Market Timing Indicators

The  reliability  of  chart  trend  patterns  can  be  enhanced  and  improved  by
observing  other  market  timing  indicators  which  have  a  track  record  for
producing  reliable  signals  in  the  commodities  markets.  Often  times  such
indicators  need  conﬁrmation  of  another  system  to  enhance  the  timing  of
buys and sells. Chart patterns and other timing indicators ﬁt together well.

Moving Averages

Moving  Averages  are  some  of  the  oldest  technical  indicators,  and  remain
some of the most useful indicators for market analysts. A Moving Average
is the average price of a security at a speciﬁc point in time. A Moving Average
shows a trend. The purpose of the Moving Average is to show the trend in
a  “smoothed”  manner,  with  less  apparent  volatility. Although  a  smoothed

Time Span

The  user  selects  the  time  span.  For  stocks,  the  most  common  time  periods
are  10-day,  30-day,  50-day,  100-day,  and  200-day  Moving  Averages.  Most
technicians, however, use variations of these numbers to suit their individual
needs. There isn’t just one “right” time frame. Moving Averages with differ-
ent time spans show different stories. The shorter the time span, the more
sensitive the Moving Average will be to price changes. The longer the time
span,  the  less  sensitive  or  the  more  smoothed  the  Moving  Average  will
appear.

The other factor to deﬁne is the price used in computations. The most
common  price  used  is  the  close  for  a  particular  day.  However,  technicians

use several other variations. They are (high + low)/2; (close + high + low)/3;
(open + close + high + low)/4; and the weighted variation is (high + low +
close + close)/4. Closing prices are signiﬁcant because they represent posi-
tions that investors are willing to carry overnight.

Single Moving Average

Perhaps the best way to understand a Moving Average is with an example.
Assume we have been tracking the closing price of IBM for the past 100 days
and  want  to  create  a  50-day  Moving Average.  First,  add  the  closing  prices
together for the ﬁrst 50 days. Then divide this amount by 50. This is the ﬁrst
point  plotted  on  the  chart.  Then  add  the  closing  prices  together  for  Day  2
through  Day  51.  Next,  divide  this  amount  by  50,  establishing  the  second
point on the chart. Then add the closing prices for Days 3 through 52 together
and divide the number by 50, etc. Connect all the points plotted together in
a line and run it through the price bars.

Average  changes  direction  but  price  does  not  cross  above  or  below  the  Moving
Average. Chart courtesy of AIQ MarketExpert (www.aiqsystems.com).

Dual Moving Averages

Moving Averages can become more powerful when multiple Moving Aver-
ages  are  plotted.  One  combination  is  to  plot  a  9-day  Moving Average  and
an 18-day Moving Average on the same chart. A buy signal is given when
the  9-day  Moving Average  crosses  above  the  18-day  Moving Average  and
both  Moving  Averages  are  in  an  upward  direction.  A  sell  signal  is  given
when the 9-day Moving Average crosses below the 18-day Moving Average
and both Moving Averages are declining.

Although any number of Moving Averages can be used, the use of three
or four is not uncommon. Dual Moving Averages appeal to many technical
analysts. Research shows using two averages tends to be the most effective.
Like many other indicators, averages can be unreliable or difﬁcult to trade
in fast markets. They contain data not within the current range of volatility;
the data never reach the present. The averages do call attention to the current
movement in relation to the past.

False  signals  can  be  given  when  prices  ﬂuctuate  in  a  Broad  Sideways
Pattern. To compensate, technicians use other indicators to conﬁrm the direc-
tion of price. Looking to the chart patterns can be the indicator of choice for

or  other  Consolidations.  Seeing  them  on  a  chart  can  clarify  the  Moving
Average signals. (See Chapter 11 on Consolidation Formations.)

Weighted and Exponential Moving Averages

There are two other types of Moving Averages, the Weighted Moving Aver-
age  and  the  Exponential  Moving  Average.  If  a  simple  Moving  Average  is
centered,  the  signal  is  delayed.  To  overcome  this,  many  technicians  use  a
Weighted Moving Average where the data are weighted in favor of the more
recent  data.  A  Weighted  Moving  Average  reverses  direction  more  quickly
than a simple Moving Average.

The most frequently used method to weight a Moving Average is, for a
5-day Moving Average, multiply the ﬁrst observation by 1; the second obser-
vation by 2; the third observation by 3; the fourth observation by 4; the ﬁfth
observation  by  5.  Then  divide  this  sum  by  the  sum  of  the  weights.  In  this
case,  the  divisor  is  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  5  =  15.  The  sum  in  the  ﬁrst  part  of  the
equation is divided by 15. With a Weighted Moving Average, a buy or sell
signal is given when the Weighted Moving Average changes direction.

An Exponential Moving Average is a form of a Weighted Moving Aver-
age.  To  construct  a  20-day  Exponential  Moving  Average,  ﬁrst  construct  a
20-day Simple Moving Average. The Simple Moving Average becomes the
starting point. Assume the Simple Moving Average value for Day 20 is 42;
the Simple Moving Average value for Day 21 is 43; and the Simple Moving
Average value for Day 22 is 44. We then subtract the Day 20 Moving Average
value  from  Day  21  Simple  Moving  Average  value  and  get  a  difference  of
1.00. This value (1.00) is multiplied by an exponent. In this case, the exponent
is  0.1.  Next,  add  0.1  to  the  Simple  Moving  Average  value  of  Day  20.  The
Exponential Moving Average value of Day 20 now becomes 42.100. And this
goes on indeﬁnitely. To calculate the exponent, divide 2 by the time period.
In our case, we divided 2 by 20 to arrive at 0.1.

The average itself can act as an area of Support and Resistance. The more
times a Moving Average is touched, the greater the signiﬁcance of a violation.
A penetration of a Moving Average is a signal that a change in trend may
be taking place. Conﬁrmations of trend changes should be conﬁrmed from
alternative  sources.  Generally,  the  longer  the  time  frame  of  the  Moving
Average, the greater the signiﬁcance of a crossover.

Moving Average Caveat

The  largest  difﬁculty  with  Moving  Averages  is  their  reliance  on  trending
markets. Flat or Consolidating markets will create similar Moving Average
Lines (see Chapter 11, Consolidation Formations). Another annoyance is for
a quick-turning market to be well ahead of the turn in the Moving Averages,
which  are  buoyed  up  by  the  numbers  from  previous  dates.  Although
Weighted  or  Exponential  Averages  partly  get  around  being  buoyed,  they
tend to whipsaw with the market and the smoothing factor is lost. These are
reasons for not being dependent on Moving Averages alone. Traditional chart
patterns can be useful in combination with Moving Averages.

EN9: Without a doubt one of the most important contributions chart analysis
can make to a mechanical system is to make the user aware of the state of the market.
A competent analyst should recognize the difference between trading and trending
markets and adjust his tactics accordingly. Unfortunately few traders seem to use
this “hybrid” approach. They fear “discretionary trading,” not trusting their own
emotional strength to deal with the enormous stress of futures trading.

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

MACD, an oscillator, is derived by dividing one Moving Average by another.
Basically, it combines three Moving Averages into two lines. In today’s com-
puter programs, the Moving Averages are usually exponentially weighted,
thus giving more weight to the more recent data. It is plotted on a chart with
a horizontal equilibrium line.

The equilibrium line is important. When the two Moving Averages cross
below the equilibrium line, it means that the shorter EMA is at a value less

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

than  the  longer  EMA.  This  is  a  Bearish  signal.  When  the  EMAs  are  above
the equilibrium line, it means that the shorter EMA has a value greater than
the longer EMA. This is a Bullish signal.

The ﬁrst line is the difference between a 12-period Exponential Moving
Average  and  a  26-period  Exponential  Moving  Average.  The  second  line
(signal line) is an approximate exponential equivalent of a 9-period Moving
Average of the ﬁrst line. The exponential values being 0.15, 0.075, and 0.20.
A MACD can be displayed as a line oscillator or a histogram.

Software allows a user to change values when calculating MACD. Some
systems require the entering of exponential values, and others use the actual
number  of  periods  for  the  three  Moving  Averages.  There  is  a  caution  on
changing original values of MACD to curve ﬁt the data. It is recommended
that two differing sets of values be used, one for the buy-side and another
for  the  sell-side.  Both  use  a  9-period  (0.20)  signal  line,  but  the  0.15,  0.075

and 17-period (0.11). The sell-side formula is normally slower 
intention  of  buying  quickly  and  letting  proﬁts  run).
  It  is  probably  best  to  stay
with the standard sell-side formula in the commodities market; even though
slower, it should be more reliable in most situations.

from MACD. Using different periods for buy and sell can help overcome some of the
difﬁculties, but using other indicators, such as trendlines drawn on the MACD line, can
also assist the trader in selecting entry and exit points. The use of trendlines here changes
the number of trades from nine to three and they are all on the right side of the market.

Buy and Sell Signals

651

Buy signals are generated when the faster line crosses the slower line from
below.  Sell  signals  come  from  the  opposite,  that  is,  when  the  faster  line
crosses  the  slower  line  from  above.  Beware  of  mechanically  trading  every
MACD  crossover,  as  it  can  lead  to  whipsaws  and  substantial  drawdowns.
The  fact  is,  narrow  trading  ranges  give  many  false  signals  which  can  be

being conscientious observance of the bar charts.

MACD Overbought–Oversold

Gerald Appel, who originally developed MACD in 1979 (as a stock market
timing device), sets the overbought and oversold signals for the S&P Index
as  a  plus  or  minus  2.50  on  the  MACD  scale.  With  the  NYSE  Index  he
recommends  plus  or  minus  1.20.  When  the  Differential  Line  crosses  into
these  areas,  a  signal  is  generated  for  buy  or  sell.  Similar  levels  can  be
observed and established for any market, thereby eliminating the whipsaw-
ing of short price swings. MACD is best used as a long-term analysis tool.

MACD Trendlines, Divergences, and Combinations

Drawing  a  trendline  along  the  MACD  and  trading  when  the  trendline  is
violated can often precede a change in the market. MACD crossovers have
more signiﬁcance when they are preceded by, or are in conjunction with, a
violation of the trendline. Aggressive traders can use the trendline break as
an  action  signal  and  cautious  traders  can  wait  for  further  conﬁrmation.
However,  it  is  possible  to  have  a  trendline  break  and  a  delayed  crossover,
which can be frustrating.

Divergence is one of the most common and effective patterns in technical
analysis. Patterns where the MACD shows Divergence from what the prices
are  doing  can  be  an  important  signal,  although  the  pattern  needs  time  to
develop and should not be anticipated.

Combining crossovers with other technical patterns can make the MACD
system more reliable as a system for trading. Major Trends are identiﬁed by
using  a  long-term  MACD  to  conﬁrm  the  short-term  MACD.  A  monthly
MACD  can  be  used  to  conﬁrm  weekly  patterns,  the  weekly  pattern  can
conﬁrm  the  daily,  and  the  daily  can  be  used  for  conﬁrmation  of  intraday.
Shorter-term  signals  can  be  traded  in  the  direction  of  longer-term  MACD;
this helps avoid problems of whipsawing markets. As with other commod-
ities trading systems, the use of stop-loss orders is recommended.

Reversals

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Reversals  in  the  direction  of  a  Moving  Average  are  usually  more  reliable
than a Moving Average Crossover. In an uptrend, the following conditions
apply:

• Long  positions  are  maintained  as  long  as  price  remains  above  the

Moving Average.

• If price crosses above the Moving Average, a buy signal is generated.
• If  price  falls  to  the  Moving  Average  but  doesn’t  cross  it  and  then

moves back up, a buy signal is generated.

If  a  price  drops  sharply  below  the  Moving  Average  Line  a  rebound
toward the Moving Average Line may occur, resulting in a whipsaw action.
In a downtrend, short positions are held as long as price remains below the
Moving Average. A sell signal is generated when price moves above a declin-
ing  Moving Average  Line.  If  price  moves  up  to  the  Moving Average  Line
but doesn’t cross it and drops down again, a sell signal is generated.*

Bollinger Bands (BB)

Developed by John Bollinger (as the Financial News Network’s Chief Tech-
nical Analyst), Bollinger Bands are Alpha–Beta bands positioned two stan-
dard deviations from a 20-day Moving Average. They were developed in an
attempt  to  improve  on  the  concept  of  ﬁxed-width  trading  bands  (trading
bands  drawn  parallel,  at  a  ﬁxed  distance  to  a  Moving Average).  Bollinger
selected standard deviations because the calculation involves squaring from
the average; it makes the system responsive to the short-term price changes.

Overbought or Oversold

The primary purpose of the developed Bollinger Bands is to indicate whether
prices  are  relatively  too  high  or  too  low.  Once  the  determination  is  made,
the trader can turn to other indicators for trading signals (such as a Relative
Strength Indicator).

Customizing

The standard deviation value can be altered. Some traders increase the value
of  the  standard  deviation  from  two  standard  deviations  to  2.5  standard

deviations  away  from  the  Moving  Average  when  using  a  50-day  Moving
Average. Conversely, many technicians lower the value of the standard devi-
ation from two to 1.5 standard deviations away from the Moving Average
when using a 10-day Moving Average. Any alteration should have the bands
containing most but not all of the data.

Bollinger Bands with Other Indicators

Since  Bollinger  Bands  do  not  generate  buy  and  sell  signals  alone,  they  are
used with other indicators, such as a Relative Strength Index (RSI) or chart
patterns. When price touches one of the bands, it can indicate a continuation
of the trend; or it might indicate a Reversal. Bollinger Bands need buy and
sell signals from other sources (see Chapter 30, Support and Resistance).

When combined with an indicator such as RSI and chart patterns, Bol-
linger Bands can become quite powerful. RSI is an excellent indicator with
respect  to  overbought  and  oversold  conditions.  When  price  touches  the
upper Bollinger Band, and RSI is below 70, it is an indication that the trend
will continue. Conversely, when price touches the lower Bollinger Band, and
RSI is above 30, it indicates the trend should continue.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

If a price touches the upper Bollinger Band and RSI is above 70 (possibly
approaching 80) the trend may reverse and decline. On the other hand, if a
price  touches  the  lower  Bollinger  Band  and  RSI  is  below  30  (possibly
approaching 20) it indicates the trend may reverse and move upward.

Driven by Market Variables

The logic behind Bollinger Bands was to create a system driven by market
variables, rather than trying to impose an external discipline on the market.
It asks the market what is happening, rather than trying to tell the market
what  it  is  doing.  Charting  follows  the  same  line  of  reasoning  and  can  be
effectively used with the bands.*

Stochastics

The Stochastic Oscillator, developed by George Lane, compares a security’s
price closing level to its price range over a speciﬁc period of time. With this
indicator, Lane theorized, in an upward-trending market, prices tend to close
near  their  high;  and  during  a  downward-trending  market,  prices  tend  to
close near their low. As an upward trend matures, prices tend to close further
away  from  their  high;  as  a  downward  trend  matures,  prices  tend  to  close
away from their low.

Clusters

The Stochastic Indicator attempts to determine when prices start to cluster
around  their  low  of  the  day  in  an  uptrending  market,  and  cluster  around
their high in a downtrend. Lane theorizes these conditions indicate a Trend
Reversal is beginning to occur.

%D Line and %K Line

The Stochastic Indicator is plotted as two lines, the %D Line and %K Line.
The %D Line is more important than the %K Line. The stochastic is plotted
on a chart with values ranging from 0 to 100. The value can never fall below
0 or above 100. Readings above 80 are considered strong and indicate a price
is closing near its high.

655

Readings below 20 are strong and indicate a price is closing near its low.
Ordinarily, the %K Line will change direction before the %D Line. However,
when the %D Line changes direction prior to the %K Line, a slow and steady
Reversal is often indicated.

When both %K and %D Lines change direction, and the faster %K Line
changes direction to retest a crossing of the %D Line, though doesn’t cross
it, the incident conﬁrms stability of the prior Reversal. A powerful move is
under way when the indicator reaches its extremes around 0 and 100. Fol-
lowing  a  Pullback  in  price,  if  the  indicator  retests  extremes,  a  good  entry
point is indicated. Many times, when the %K or %D Lines begin to ﬂatten
out, the action becomes an indication the trend will reverse during the next
trading range.

Periodicity of D

For commodities, the number of periods to use in stochastics is based on the
cycle of the commodity being traded. First, determine the cycle of the com-
modity,  then  use  the  number  of  bars  for  stochastics  corresponding  to  one
half of the period of the cycle. If an 18-day cycle is observed, 9-day stochastics
are  used.  Shorter-term  stochastics  should  be  used  to  ﬁne-tune  an  entry  or
exit at the point of decision. However, the analyst should immediately revert
back to the optimum stochastic and be certain to trade with the trend.*

Divergence

Quite  often  Divergence  appears  on  the  chart.  The  price  may  be  making
higher  highs,  but  the  Stochastic  Oscillator  is  making  lower  lows.  Or,  con-
versely,  price  may  be  making  lower  highs,  and  the  Stochastic  Oscillator  is
making higher highs. In either case, the indicator is often demonstrating a
change in price before price itself is changing.

The  Stochastic  Oscillator  analysis  system  was  originally  developed  by
George Lane back in the mid-1950s. At ﬁrst, he believed the only valid signal
was the Divergence between %D and the securities price. Later, he recanted
and  stated  this  was  not  strictly  true  and,  furthermore,  adherence  to  the
original could get a beginning analyst into trouble.

In an uptrending market, Lane has learned, many congested Tops, often
Double Tops or Triple Tops (see Chapter 9, Important Reversal Patterns, for
more information on Double and Triple Tops), can take several time periods
to  turn  down  and  approach  the  bottom  trendline.  He  refers  to  them  as
“Garbage Tops.”

When prices ﬁnally do turn down, they often bottom quickly and turn
right back up again, creating “Spike Bottoms.” These are to be expected in
an uptrending market. Knowledge of them can be helpful in strong trending
markets.

The 0% and 100% Misunderstandings

A misunderstanding some stochastic analysts have refers to the %K reaching
the  extremes  of  100%  or  0%.  When  the  %K  Line  reaches  100%,  it  does  not
mean that the prices can’t go higher. Conversely, even though the %K is at
zero, prices can still go lower. Zero is not necessarily a Bottom; in fact, the
opposite could be true. The extremes denote strength at the 100% level and
extreme weakness at zero.* The misunderstanding comes from levels com-
monly  believed  to  indicate  “overbought”  or  “oversold.”  When  the  %K
and %D  Lines  rise  above  75%,  it  is  considered  an  overbought  situation.

Conversely, if they drop below 25%, it is considered oversold (some traders
use  80%  and  20%  for  the  indicator  levels).  When  the  move  is  a  sustained
move, the price decline can continue for an extended period, with the oscil-
lator remaining near the bottom.

Check the Weekly/Monthly

Stochastics,  as  well  as  trend  charting,  should  always  look  at  the  bigger
picture  as  well  as  the  tight  focus.  If  a  daily  chart  is  followed,  it  should  be
compared to a weekly chart for a better understanding of what is happening
in the longer term. The longer-term trend chart helps the analyst to under-
stand developments leading up to the current market situation.

Stochastics, used in combination with conventional charting techniques
and  common  sense,  can  work  well.  For  example,  if  an  unviolated  trend  is
in force, with no Consolidations or Reversal Patterns forming, the stochastic
signal  is  likely  false.  If,  however,  a  Symmetrical  Triangle  is  forming  and  a
trend is being violated, the signal is conﬁrmed.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Stochastics Formula

Stochastics charts begin with three value calculations:

• The Raw Value
• %K
• %D

The three values are plotted on a scale from 0 to 100. If the raw value
and  %K  are  plotted  on  the  same  chart,  it  results  in  “fast  stochastics.”  Fast
stochastics  show  several  up  and  down  swings  in  a  short  period  of  time.
When  the  %K  and  %D  are  used,  they  create  “slow  stochastics.”  Slow  sto-
chastics have smoothed data lines.

Raw  value  requires  20 days  of  information;  the  20-day  high  is  the  highest

20-day  time  period.  They  are  not  the  high  and  low  price  from  20 days
previous.

Stochastics can be useful in analyzing changes in commodities trading.
It has been around for more than 30 years and has a well-established track
record. Even so, like most systems of analysis, it is best used in combination
with conventional charting techniques and common sense. The price of the
commodity  is  being  traded,  not  the  stochastic  signal  or  other  indicator.
Although technical indicators can be helpful, they must always be viewed
in the context of what is happening with the market trend.

Volume and Open Interest

Investors  always  like  to  see  strong  volume  on  market  advances  and  light
volume on declines. Volume is considered an important indicator of market
sentiment in the stock market. It is also important, but different, in the futures
markets.

Volume as Conﬁrmation

Volume  patterns  are  considered  normal  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  and  any
sudden  change  represents  a  Divergence.  Volume  doesn’t  have  the  same
signiﬁcance  as  with  equity  trading  and  the  information  is  comparatively
delayed. Although volume is part of the picture, it is only somewhat useful
as a conﬁrmation (in hindsight) of what other indicators are signaling.

Money Flow

Open-interest ﬁgures are normally plotted on a line above the volume infor-
mation. In a general sense, they measure the amount of money ﬂowing into
and  out  of  the  futures  market.  When  both  sides  of  a  trade  are  new  to  the
market, the open interest increases. If one side is new and the other is old,
open interest is unchanged. When both sides close out, open interest declines.

Open interest and prices will rise as new money ﬂows into the market.
Buyers are willing to pay higher prices and sellers are willing to receive them
(the number of buyers and sellers is always equal). It is a Bullish situation
for the commodity.

When prices rise and open interest declines, there are few new buyers
and money is leaving the market. Rallies can be caused by the covering of
short positions exiting the market. Although the situation can obviously be
Bullish for the short term, it will turn Bearish. Any rally will falter without
new money coming into the market; however, short covering can take longer
than expected.

When  prices  are  falling  and  open  interest  is  rising,  and  new  money  is
coming into the market and there is selling pressure, it is considered Bearish.
Prices  fall  and  open  interest  falls  is  the  opposite  of  situation  2.  Short
sellers are staying in the market and long-position holders are closing. There
is  little  new  money  coming  into  the  market  and  the  situation  is  initially
Bearish, but can turn Bullish. As the declining momentum slows, short sellers
will quickly begin to cover and new money often returns.

New Money

Futures are dependent on new money for price stability and growth because
for  every  buyer  there  is  a  seller.  With  equity  stocks,  it  is  possible  to  have
pressure situations with more buyers than sellers or the other way around.
It is the new money in futures that creates the rising prices in an uptrend.
New money coming in will cause the open interest and volume to rise, but
to be a truly Bullish indicator, they must be accompanied by rising prices.
The action might be over by the time all three are observed.

take  longer  than  expected.  Note  the  decline  in  open  interest  even  though  prices
advanced.  Open  interest  didn’t  show  a  signiﬁcant  increase  until  early  November.
Chart courtesy of Market Research, Inc. (www.barchart.com).

Even though volume and open interest data have value as far as the big
picture  is  concerned,  the  data  can  be  late  and  unreliable  if  used  alone  for
forecasting short-term. Other indicators can be more reliable, with volume
and open interest used in a more general sense or for conﬁrmation.

Volume  data  with  equities  can  have  greater  signiﬁcance  because  of
immediacy and the fact that an imbalance of buyers and sellers can exist. In
futures trading there is a seller for every buyer. Open interest data can have
some signiﬁcance, but it is often not as reliable as other indicators for trading
purposes.*

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

Wilder Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Although relative strength, comparing a security price to a benchmark index
price (such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index), has existed for many years,
the Wilder Relative Strength Index was developed by J. Welles Wilder as a
system for giving actual buy and sell signals in a changing market.

Relative  Strength  is  often  used  to  identify  price  tops  and  bottoms  by
keying on speciﬁc levels (usually “30” and “70”) on the RSI chart, which is
scaled from 0–100. The RSI can also be useful to show:

1. Movement which might not be as readily apparent on the bar chart.
2. Swing failures above 70 or below 30, warning of coming Reversals.
3. Support and Resistance Levels appear with greater clarity.
4. Divergence between the RSI and price can often be a useful Reversal

indicator.

The  Relative  Strength  Index  requires  a  certain  amount  of  lead  time  in

order to operate successfully.

Swing Failures (“W” Formations)

When a Relative Strength Index Line spikes down and penetrates 30 on the
Index  Scale,  then  moves  up,  then  is  followed  by  another  down  spike  (less
than  the  ﬁrst),  a  buy  signal  is  generated  as  the  index  line  rises  to  a  level
equal to the middle of the “W” Formation. A sell signal appears in a similar
manner, but spiking up rather than down (an upside down “W”), above 70
on the index scale.

Divergence

Probably  the  most  common  and  signiﬁcant  trend  pattern  in  virtually  all
technical indicators is the pattern of Divergence. Divergence refers to instru-
ments  which  normally  follow  the  same  general  direction  together  moving
apart and proceding in different directions, and indicates trend weakness in
the  current  direction.  It  often  signals  a  reliable  Reversal.  Divergences  in
trends  are  analyzed  between  the  Dow  Industrial  Average  as  compared  to
the  Dow  Transportation  Average,  stock  prices  compared  to  indexes  (e.g.,
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index) or between futures prices and a 10- to 14-day
Relative  Strength  Index.  Traders  will  often  wait  for  a  conﬁrmation  of  a
Divergence before placing their transactions in order to not be taken in by
false signals.

FIGURE 193.
Corn Futures, March 1997. The sell signal in July had excellent timing
for a trade. The buy signal appeared in the 14-day Relative Strength Index as the line
penetrated  the  high  point  between  the  Swing  Failures  in  early  October  and  early
November. Also, there is an important Divergence between the RSI moving sideways
and  the  downtrend  of  prices.  Divergence  between  prices  and  a  Relative  Strength
Index is considered an important Reversal signal. The late July through August time
period possibly has other Failure Swings followed by penetrations, but they are not
as  well  deﬁned  as  the  others.  Chart  courtesy  of  Market  Research,  Inc.  (www.bar-
chart.com).

Time Periods

Although  the  most  popular  time  period  appears  to  be  the  14-day  Relative
Strength  Index,  other  time  periods  can  be  used.  Shorter,  6-day  RSIs  are
frequently  used  for  intraday  analysis  to  ﬁnd  proﬁt-taking  points  after  the
RSI reaches 75 or higher and pulls back. The shorter RSI is more responsive
in  showing  a  pause  in  the  current  trend.  Some  go  further  and  use  a  very
sensitive 3-day RSI to determine reentry points as the indicator moves back
to  neither  overbought  nor  oversold  (between  70  and  30).  A  10-week  RSI
Divergence is often used with ﬁnancials. It frequently gives good signals in
stock indices, bonds, and currencies. However, weekly signals appear to be
somewhat less accurate and frequent in other markets.*

30-Year Treasury Bond Futures, March 1997. Overbought is above 70
and oversold below 30. The RSI dropped to the 30 mark in late August, but didn’t
sharply  penetrate,  showing  a  weak  buy  signal  for  the  sensitivity  of  this  14-day
indicator. Although a sell signal was generated after the above 70 Failure Swings in
November, an even stronger signal was given by the Divergence between the futures
prices  and  the  Relative  Strength  Index.  (See  Chapter 12,  Support  and  Resistance.)

Relative Strength Formula

RSI  is  based  on  the  difference  between  the  average  of  the  closing  price  on
up  days  vs.  the  average  closing  price  on  the  down  days. A  time  period  of
14 days is common, but other periods can also be used.

RSI = 100 −

(
100 I U D
+

)

U = average of upward price closes (EMA of gains)
D = average of downward price closes (EMA of losses)

Relative Strength Indexes have become popular as countertrend oscilla-
tors. They give reliable overbought and oversold indications in most markets
and  can  show  long-term  Divergence  Patterns  indicating  Major  Tops  and
Bottoms.  The  buy  and  sell  signals  given  by  an  RSI  are  generally  clear,  but
can be adjusted to greater sensitivity for short-term or long-term trading.

Rough Rice Futures, January 1997. The signals won’t precisely hit the
price  bottom  or  top,  but  with  Rough  Rice  they  hit  reasonable  levels  before  the
Reversals. The sell signal came in July, after the RSI (above the 70 level) showed two
down spikes with an upturn rising above the middle between the spikes. The buy
signal came after a similar situation (below the 30 level) in October. Chart courtesy
of Market Research, Inc. (www.barchart.com).

Chart patterns offer commodities traders another visual perspective of
where prices are likely to go and when they are likely to reverse. Although
chart patterns have a history of success and need no validation, it is inter-
esting  to  see  how  well  they  match  the  signals  given  by  oscillators,  bands,
Moving Averages, and other indicators. Identical signals of trend and change
between chart patterns and other indicators are common. In fact, if identical
signals do not appear, the validity of those appearing should be questioned.
One of the most frustrating tendencies of all indicators is to give false signals
from time to time. The frustration can be partly moderated by using more
than  one  signal-producing  indicator.  Conﬁrmed  signals  and  trends,  with
experience  and  understanding  of  the  markets,  produce  proﬁtable  trading
results.

Important Concepts in Commodities/Derivatives Trading

• Prices  are  inﬂuenced  by  external  factors  such  as  weather  changes,

supply, and demand.

• Futures trading is mostly made up of hedgers and speculators in for

a shorter period of time than with stock trading.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

• Futures can have an unlimited number of contracts open.
• Futures have an expiration date which will inﬂuence prices.
• Stop-loss orders are essential.
• Make use of more than one indicator to make a buy or sell decision.
• Trendlines are the most important patterns and can be drawn on the
indicators  as  well  as  on  the  prices.  Divergence  is  one  of  the  more
reliable signals.

• Chart patterns can be used in combination with other indicators.
• Trades are made on prices, not on indicators.
• Look  at  the  big  picture  by  observing  longer-term  trends  (weekly,

monthly).

• Time  periods  can  be  altered  on  indicators  to  give  a  more  sensitive
picture (fewer time periods) or smoother picture (greater number of
time periods).

Although this formula is ﬂawed, it will not hinder the reader to know about
it and understand it. Believing in it would be quite a different matter, how-
ever. The Sharpe Ratio itself is as follows:

is the expected return
is the risk-free interest rate

The  effect  of  this  inﬂexible  formula  is  to  stick  the  trader  with  a  mea-
suring tool of little use to the practical trader. It assumes that volatility of
returns  as  measured  by  sd  equals  risk  (the  common  academic  problem).
In the inﬂexibility of the sd calculation, it fails to measure the most impor-
tant fact in trading, the maximum drawdown, or, the inevitable ﬂuctuations
in gains and losses. Speciﬁcally, the greatest expected or experienced loss,
the  retracement  from  greatest  high  to  greatest  low,  and  the  sequences  of
these experiences.

Section 5
Calculating Volatility

To  calculate  volatility  of  a  portfolio,  ﬁrst  ﬁnd  the  difference  between  each
return and the average. Then square each difference and add them together.
Divide the sum by the number of returns minus one. This result is known
as  the  variance.  Finally,  take  the  square  root  of  the  variance  to  get  the
volatility. Combining these steps into a formula:

Step 1: Calculate the average return.
Step 2: Calculate the deviation of each return.
Step 3: Square each period’s deviation.
Step 4: Add them together.
Step 5: Divide the sum by the number of periods minus 1.
Step 6: Take the square root.

Gambler’s Ruin

Reprinted  from

The  Education  of  a  Speculator

  by  Victor  Niederhoffer.  With

The classic gambler’s ruin problem, which applies to all speculative situa-
tions, can be framed this way. A speculator with initial capital of C plays a
game with a casino: he wins $1.00 each play with probability P, or loses $1.00

with probability Q, which is 1 – P. The speculator plans to stay in the game
until his capital appreciates to A or depreciates to ruin at 0. It can be shown
that, in such a game, the speculator’s probability of ruin is:

(

A

Q P
(

) −(
Q P

A
) −1

C

)

Plugging numbers into the formula, a speculator who has a 60% chance
of winning each play, and who starts with $1.00 and tries to run it to $10.00,
will  face  a  66.1%  chance  of  ruin  for  the  session.  Because  he  has  a  33.9%
chance (100% – 66.1%) of ﬁnishing the session with $10.00, his expected ﬁnal
bankroll is $3.39. He started with $1.00, so he expects to gain $2.39.

The table below summarizes the expected gains for a gambling session,
given  initial  capital  C  and  probability  P  of  winning  each  day.  With  a  60%
chance of winning, the size of the bankroll becomes critical. By starting with
$4.00 rather than $1.00, the speculator increases his expected gain from $2.39
to $4.17 — an increase akin to the winning edge held by strong, well-funded
players in a poker game. Above a $4.00 bankroll, the decreased risk of ruin
is more than offset by the diminished beneﬁt of achieving the $10.00 goal.
For example, with capital of $9.00, ruin is very rare, but the upside is only
$1.00 ($10.00 – $9.00).

This idealized formulation of the gambler’s ruin problem demonstrates
the  tradeoff  that  arises  in  practical  trading.  The  speculator  wants  to  bet
lightly enough, relative to his capital, to fend off gambler’s ruin, but heavily
enough to make his desired rate of return. Unfortunately, the real-life spec-
ulator doesn’t know his true odds of winning on each trade, so he can’t look
up the optimum betting levels in a table.

When the odds of success are less than 50%, the situation changes.
Whereas the player with an edge should bet small, trying to grind out
a proﬁt, the player with the worst of it is better advised to go for the home
run,  betting  the  maximum,  because  this  is  the  only  way  he  can  end  up  a
winner.  This  explains,  in  part,  why  casinos  have  limits  on  the  stakes  that
players  can  use  against  them,  and  why  the  exchanges  have  established
position limits on what the public can hold.

John Magee Market Letters

 December 15, 1984

The Elliott Wave Theory: Perspective and Comments

This  week  we  had  the  pleasure  of  attending  the  December  meeting  of  the
Market Technicians Association of New York.

Long-term  subscribers  will  remember  the  MTANY  as  the  organization
which honored John Magee with its “Man of the Year” award in 1978. The
speaker  was  Robert  Prechter,  publisher  of  “The  Elliott  Wave  Theorist,”  an
investment  advisory  which  bases  its  forecasts  on  interpretations  of  R.N.
Elliott’s work on the stock market.

Of primary interest to SAS subscribers are Prechter’s comments on tech-
nical analysis itself. The Elliott Wave Theory, it must be remembered, is really
no more than a “catalog” of stock market price movements, laid one on top
of the other, so to speak, until a grand, underlying, and enduring pattern is
 analysis. Among Prechter’s deﬁnitions and
observed; in short, pure 
observations regarding fundamental analysis are the following:

technical

1. “First let’s deﬁne ‘technical’ versus ‘fundamental’ data … technical
data  is  that  which  is  generated  by  the  action  of  the  market  under
study.”

2. “The main problem with fundamental analysis is that its indicators
are  removed  from  the  market  itself.  The  analyst  assumes  causality
between external events and market movements, a concept which is
almost certainly false. But, just as important, and less recognized, is
forecast  of  the
that  fundamental  analysis  almost  always  requires  a 
fundamental data itself
 before conclusions about the market are drawn.
The  analyst  is  then  forced  to  take  a  second  step  in  coming  to  a
conclusion about how those forecasted events will affect the markets!
Technicians  only  have  one  step  to  take,  which  gives  them  an  edge
right  off  the  bat.  Their  main  advantage  is  that  they  don’t  have  to
forecast their indicators.”

3. “What’s worse, even the fundamentalists’ second step is probably a
process built on quicksand…. The most common application of fun-
damental  analysis  is  estimating  companies’  earnings  for  both  the
current  year  and  next  year,  and  recommending  stocks  on  that  ba-
sis.…And  the  record  on  that  basis  alone  is  very  poor,  as  Barron’s
pointed out in a June 4 article, which showed that earnings estimates
averaged  18%  error  in  the  thirty  DJIA  stocks  for  any  year  already
completed and 54% error for the year ahead. The weakest link, how-
ever, is the assumption that correct earnings estimates are a basis for

choosing  stock  market  winners.  According  to  a  table  in  the  same
Barron’s  article,  a  purchase  of  the  ten  DJIA  stocks  with  the  best
earnings estimates would have produced a ten-year cumulative gain
of 40.5%, while choosing the ten DJIA with the worst earnings esti-
mates would have produced a whopping 142.5% gain.”

We enjoyed Prechter’s polished exposition of a technical approach dif-
ferent  from  our  own. As  for  his  observations  about  fundamental  analysis,
we simply couldn’t agree more.

Section 8

The ﬁrst cave men, ﬁghting over resources used teeth and claws. The nature
of warfare was changed forever when one of the smarter ones picked up a
tree branch. Then another smart one discovered the principle of artillery and
picked up a rock. Naïve and arrogant traders laughed at Wyckoff’s charts.
Market  makers  on  the  Pacﬁﬁc  Coast  Options  Exchange  sniggered  at  Blair
Hull when he started appearing on the ﬂoor with print outs. In the days of
 who appeared with
the wooden racquet squash players hated the 
metal and then composite racquets.

arrivistes

No  longer.  The  last  to  adopt  the  new  weapons  is  a  dead  man.  Charts
showed their power and so did Hull’s wonky print outs made with the Black
Scholes Model. The losers ﬁgured out pretty quickly they needed new weap-
ons.  With  that  dissertation  on  the  epistemology  of  warfare  I  present  some
of  my  favorite  weapons  in  the  following  software  and  Internet  sites.  No
attempt  whatsoever  is  made  to  be  comprehensive  or  encyclopedic.  On  the
contrary,  idiosyncrasy  is  my  operating  method  and  no  disfavor  is  implied
to those not included here.

For  myself,  three  desktop  software  packages  are  powerful  and  sufﬁ-
cient  for  all  the  needs  of  a  technical  analyst:  AIQ  Trading  Expert  Pro
(aiqsystems.com);  Metastock  9.0  (equis.com);  and  TradeStation  2000i
(tradestation.com).  The  reader  will  ﬁnd  examples  of  charts  sprinkled
throughout this book, supplementing the beautiful hand drawn charts of
Magee. All these packages have the basic requirements necessary for tech-
nical chart analysis, basic charting on readily available data and portfolio.
I  have  said  before  that  all  the  chart  analyst  really  needs  is  the  ability  to
draw lines on a chart … and then perhaps to see the chart as a line chart,
or  a  candlestick  chart  or….  And  so  on  and  so  on.  The  analyst  is  soon
seduced by the dazzling features, AND the analysis is enriched and made
more powerful. And even if one says (as I do) when he looks at an oversold
tool “What do I need that for? I saw it on the bar chart.” The analyst ﬁnds
himself wanting to know more about %R. If it worked for Larry Williams
there must be something in it.

AIQ – TRADING EXPERT PRO

AIQ’s  package  includes  an  on-screen  control  panel  and  scrolling  indicator
boxes which are color coded and this information is synthesized in an indi-
cator  barometer.  Data  management  is  smooth  and  easy  and  the  user  may
use a system module to create and test his own trading ideas. A panoply of
reports are available to aid the investor. For the trader real time alerts are a
feature. A portfolio manager module aids the investor in managing not just
the portfolio but his positions by making stop management facile. An Expert
Guru lurks behind the curtain to aid the user in analyzing situations.

METASTOCK 9.0

Metastock  9.0  boasts  an  impressive  array  of  tools  and  indicators.  “System
Experts” pop up on demand and can also guide the user through systems
tests and explorations. The Experts can also suggest buys and sells. A point
and ﬁgure toolbox is a valuable feature. The ability to create and test trading
systems, with exhaustive and critical data analysis, is a powerful tool. Metas-
tock adapts easily to add ons, of which Slauson’s Powerstrike (the quanti-
tative tool for ﬁnding critical support/resistance zones) is a good example.

Tradestation 2000i and Tradestation 8

Tradestation 2000i is the standalone version of Tradestation 8. Tradestation
8 is a real time on-line package which allows for trading through the Trades-
tation  brokerage  afﬁliate.  The  package  is  so  powerful  that  on-line  profes-
sional and semi-professional users probably beneﬁt by combining their soft-
ware arrangement with a brokerage arrangement. 2000i requires the user to
maintain  his  local  database,  while  Tradestation  8  always  has  the  data  on
demand. For the creatively lazy (among them the editor) this is an attractive
feature. Systems building and testing has always beeen and remains a pow-
erful  feature  of  Tradestation.  With  “EasyLanguage”  the  user  may  specify
virtually any system he can think of. And then chat about it with the Trades-
tation community of traders. This community has contributed to a large data
base of trading systems and ideas.

The Internet: prophet.net

And,  for  the  even  lazier  and  more  casual  investor  there  is  prophet.net  an
Internet  technical  analysis  site  whose  free  features  will  fulﬁll  the  needs  of
the general charting investor. With powerful interactive charts and portfolio

as  Mark  Twain  said,  a  penny  saved  is  a  penny  earned. Actually,  what  did
Ben  mean  by  that?  A  penny  saved  is  capital  when  put  to  work.  A  user
community and sharing are other attractions. And of course, no local data

Of  similar  quality,  and  similarly  honored  by  Forbes  and

important technical method, especially for the patient investor. All the other
features  are  available  at  stockcharts.com,  candlesticks,  bar  charts,  etc. And
the distinguished analyst John Murphy makes his electronic home there with
Greg Morris, a noted candlestick authority. There is also a ”Voyeur” feature
which allows the user to see what other traders are doing.

EN9: In a unique act of intellectual generosity Curtis Faith, one of Richard Dennis’
original Turtles, wrote a fully articulated account of the trading system used in the
futures markets by the Turtles. This document, which may be found in its entirety
at originalturtles.org is the very model of a modern major general’s trading notebook.
(Occasionally Gilbert and Sullivan intrude into even the most disciplined account
of trading systems.) I have a number of systems and procedures manuals like this
in  my  ﬁles.  For  all  intents  and  purposes  they  have  very  similar  contents.  Faith’s
Turtle manual is probably the best written in my experience. And probably the one
with which I am most in agreement. 

My agreement with the document stems from my preference for “natu-
ral” systems, as opposed to “number driven” systems. Chart reading systems
ﬁt naturally over market facts, as a glove over a hand. High/low systems,
self-adjust to the rhythms of the
like the Turtle system and 
markets. And  like  all  mechanical  systems  it  has  its  virtues  and  vices.  The
absolute worst vice of the mechanical trading system is, like a machine run
amok,  if  the  market  rhythms  get  on  the  wrong  harmonic  the  system  will
treat capital like a meat grinder treats beefsteak. A bloody sight to behold.
Especially when it is your ox being ground.

like Dow Theory 

It would be unspeakably rash of me to recommend the adoption out of
the box of this system. But I strongly suspect that in broad trending markets
some adaptation of it will be very productive.

And,

 I 

require

 all of my graduate students to produce such a workbook,

and this is the model I give them to emulate.

Chapter 1
A Complete Trading System 

The  Turtle  Trading  System  was  a  Complete  Trading  System,  one  that
covered  every  aspect  of  trading,  and  left  virtually  no  decision  to  the
subjective whims of the trader. 

Most successful traders use a mechanical trading system. This is no coinci-
dence. A  good  mechanical  trading  system  automates  the  entire  process  of
trading. The system provides answers for each of the decisions a trader must
make while trading. The system makes it easier for a trader to trade consis-
tently because there is a set of rules which speciﬁcally deﬁne exactly what
should  be  done.  The  mechanics  of  trading  are  not  left  up  to  the  judgment
of the trader.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

If you know that your system makes money over the long run, it is easier
to take the signals and trade according to the system during periods of losses.
If you are relying on your own judgment during trading, you may ﬁnd that
you  are  fearful  just  when  you  should  be  bold,  and  courageous  when  you
should be cautious. 

If you have a mechanical trading system that works, and you follow it
consistently,  your  trading  will  be  consistent  despite  the  inner  emotional
struggles that might come from a long series of losses, or a large proﬁt. The
conﬁdence,  consistency,  and  discipline  afforded  by  a  thoroughly  tested
mechanical system are the key to many of the most proﬁtable traders’ success. 
The  Turtle  Trading  System  was  a  Complete  Trading  System.  Its  rules
covered every aspect of trading, and left no decisions to the subjective whims
of the trader. It had every component of a Complete Trading System. 

The Components of a Complete System 

A  Complete  Trading  System  covers  each  of  the  decisions  required  for  suc-
cessful trading:

• Markets — What to buy or sell 
• Position Sizing — How much to buy or sell 
• Entries — When to buy or sell 
• Stops — When to get out of a losing position 
• Exits — When to get out of a winning position 
• Tactics — How to buy or sell 

Markets — What to buy or sell 
The  ﬁrst  decision  is  what  to  buy  and  sell,  or  essentially,  what  markets  to
trade.  If  you  trade  too  few  markets  you  greatly  reduce  your  chances  of
getting aboard a trend. At the same time, you don’t want to trade markets
that have too low a trading volume, or that don’t trend well. 

Position Sizing — How much to buy or sell 
The decision about how much to buy or sell is absolutely fundamental, and
yet is often glossed over or handled improperly by most traders. 

How  much  to  buy  or  sell  affects  both  diversiﬁcation  and  money  man-
agement.  Diversiﬁcation  is  an  attempt  to  spread  risk  across  many  instru-
ments, and to increase the opportunity for proﬁt by increasing the opportu-
nities for catching successful trades. Proper diversiﬁcation requires making
similar, if not identical bets on many different instruments. Money manage-
ment  is  really  about  controlling  risk  by  not  betting  so  much  that  you  run
out of money before the good trends come.

How much to buy or sell is the single most important aspect of trading.
Most beginning traders risk far too much on each trade, and greatly increase
their chances of going bust, even if they have an otherwise valid trading style. 

— 

When to buy or sell 

Entries 
The decision of when to buy or sell is often called the entry decision. Auto-
mated systems generate entry signals which deﬁne the exact price and mar-
ket conditions to enter the market, whether by buying or selling. 

— 

When to get out of a losing position 

Stops 
Traders who do not cut their losses will not be successful in the long term.
The most important thing about cutting your losses is to predeﬁne the point
where you will get out 

 you enter a position. 

before

— 

When to get out of a winning position 

Exits 
Many  “trading  systems”  that  are  sold  as  complete  trading  systems  do  not
speciﬁcally address the exit of winning positions. Yet the question of when
to get out of a winning position is crucial to the proﬁtability of the system.
Any  trading  system  that  does  not  address  the  exit  of  winning  positions  is
not a Complete Trading System. 

— 

How to buy or sell 

Tactics 
Once  a  signal  has  been  generated,  tactical  considerations  regarding  the
mechanics of execution become important. This is especially true for larger
accounts,  where  the  entry  and  exit  of  positions  can  result  in  signiﬁcant
adverse price movement, or market impact. 

Summary 

Using  a  mechanical  system  is  the  best  way  to  consistently  make  money
trading. If you know that your system makes money over the long run, it is
easier to take the signals and follow the system during periods of losses. If
you rely on your own judgment, during trading you may ﬁnd that you are
fearful just when you should be courageous, or courageous when you should
be fearful. 

If  you  have  a  proﬁtable  mechanical  trading  system,  and  you  follow  it
religiously,  then  your  trading  will  be  proﬁtable,  and  the  system  will  help
you survive the emotional struggles that inevitably result from a long series
of losses, or large proﬁts. 

The trading system that was used by the Turtles was a Complete Trading
System. This was a major factor in our success. Our system made it easier

Chapter 2
Markets: What the Turtles Traded 

The Turtles traded liquid futures that traded on U.S. exchanges 
in Chicago and New York. 

The Turtles were futures traders, at the time more popularly called commod-
ities traders. We traded futures contracts on the most popular U.S. commod-
ities exchanges. 

Since we were trading millions of dollars, we could not trade markets
that only traded a few hundred contracts per day because that would mean
that the orders we generated would move the market so much that it would
be too difﬁcult to enter and exit positions without taking large losses. The
Turtles traded only the most liquid markets. 

In  general,  the  Turtles  traded  all  liquid  U.S.  markets  except  the  grains
and  the  meats.  Since  Richard  Dennis  was  already  trading  the  full  position
limits  for  his  own  account,  he  could  not  permit  us  to  trade  grains  for  him
without exceeding the exchange’s position limits. 

We  did  not  trade  the  meats  because  of  a  corruption  problem  with  the
ﬂoor  traders  in  the  meat  pits.  Some  years  after  the  Turtles  disbanded,  the
FBI conducted a major sting operation in the Chicago meat pits and indicted
many traders for price manipulation and other forms of corruption. 

The following is a list of the futures markets traded by the Turtles:

The Turtles were given the discretion of not trading any of the commodities
on the list. However, if a trader chose not to trade a particular market, then
he was not to trade that market at all. We were not supposed to trade markets
inconsistently. 

Chapter 3
Position Sizing 

The  Turtles  used  a  volatility-based  constant  percentage  risk  position
sizing algorithm. 

Position sizing is one of the most important but least understood components
of any trading system. The Turtles used a position sizing algorithm that was
very  advanced  for  its  day,  because  it  normalized  the  dollar  volatility  of  a
position by adjusting the position size based on the dollar volatility of the
market. This meant that a given position would tend to move up or down
in a given day about the same amount in dollar terms (when compared to
positions  in  other  markets),  irrespective  of  the  underlying  volatility  of  the
particular market. 

This  is  true  because  positions  in  markets  that  moved  up  and  down  a
large amount per contract would have an offsetting smaller number of con-
tracts than positions in markets that had lower volatility. 

This  volatility  normalization  is  very  important  because  it  means  that
different  trades  in  different  markets  tend  to  have  the  same  chance  for  a
particular dollar loss or a particular dollar gain. This increased the effective-
ness of the diversiﬁcation of trading across many markets. 

Even if the volatility of a given market was lower, any signiﬁcant trend
would  result  in  a  sizeable  win  because  the  Turtles  would  have  held  more
contracts of that lower volatility commodity. 

Volatility — The Meaning of N 

The Turtles used a concept that Richard Dennis and Bill Eckhardt called N
to represent the underlying volatility of a particular market. N is simply the
20-day exponential moving average of the True Range, which is now more

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

commonly known as the ATR. Conceptually, N represents the average range
in price movement that a particular market makes in a single day, accounting
for  opening  gaps.  N  was  measured  in  the  same  points  as  the  underlying
contract. 

To compute the daily true range: 

True Range = 

Maximum 

(H-L, H-PDC, PDC-L) 

where: 
H
L
PDC = Previous Day’s Close 

= Current High 
= Current Low 

To compute N use the following formula:

N

=

(
19

·

PDN TR
+

)

20

where: 
PDN = Previous Day’s N 
TR = Current Day’s True Range 

Since this formula requires a previous day’s N value, you must start with a
20-day simple average of the True Range for the initial calculation. 

Dollar Volatility Adjustment 

The ﬁrst step in determining the position size was to determine the dollar
volatility represented by the underlying market’s price volatility (deﬁned by
its N). 

This  sounds  more  complicated  than  it  is.  It  is  determined  using  the

simple formula: 

Dollar Volatility = N x Dollars per Point 

Volatility Adjusted Position Units 

The Turtles built positions in pieces which we called Units. Units were sized
so that 1 N represented 1% of the account equity. 

Thus, a unit for a given market or commodity can be calculated using

the following formula: 

Unit = 

Account of 1%

You might ask: “How often is it necessary to compute the values for N
and  the  Unit  Size?”  The  Turtles  were  provided  with  a  Unit  size  sheet  on
Monday  of  each  week  that  listed  the  N,  and  the  Unit  size  in  contracts  for
each of the futures that we traded. 

The Importance of Position Sizing 

Diversiﬁcation is an attempt to spread risk across many instruments and to
increase the opportunity for proﬁt by increasing the opportunities for catch-
ing  successful  trades.  To  properly  diversify  requires  making  similar  if  not
identical bets on many different instruments. 

The Turtle System used market volatility to measure the risk involved
in  each  market.  We  then  used  this  risk  measurement  to  build  positions  in
increments  that  represented  a  constant  amount  of  risk  (or  volatility).  This
enhanced  the  beneﬁts  of  diversiﬁcation,  and  increased  the  likelihood  that
winning trades would offset losing trades. 

Note  that  this  diversiﬁcation  is  much  harder  to  achieve  when  using
insufﬁcient trading capital. Consider the above example if a $100,000 account
had been used. The unit size would have been a single contract, since 1.688
truncates  to  1.  For  smaller  accounts,  the  granularity  of  adjustment  is  too
large, and this greatly reduces the effectiveness of diversiﬁcation. 

Units As a Measure of Risk 

Since  the  Turtles  used  the  Unit  as  the  base  measure  for  position  size,  and
since  those  units  were  volatility  risk  adjusted,  the  Unit  was  a  measure  of
both the risk of a position, and of the entire portfolio of positions. 

The Turtles were given risk management rules that limited the number
of Units that we could maintain at any given time, on four different levels.
In essence, these rules controlled the total risk that a trader could carry, and
these  limits  minimized  losses  during  prolonged  losing  periods,  as  well  as
during extraordinary price movements. 

An example of an extraordinary price movement was the day after the
October 1987 stock market crash. The U.S. Federal Reserve lowered interest
rates by several percentage points overnight to boost the conﬁdence of the
stock market and the country. The Turtles were loaded long in interest rate
futures:  Eurodollars,  TBills  and  Bonds.  The  losses  the  following  day  were
enormous. In some cases, 20% to 40% of account equity was lost in a single
day. But these losses would have been correspondingly higher without the
maximum position limits.

crude oil; gold and silver; Swiss franc and Deutschmark; TBill and Eurodol-
lar, etc. 

Loosely  Correlated  Markets

  —  For  loosely  correlated  markets,  there
could be a maximum of 10 Units in one particular direction. Loosely corre-
lated markets included: gold and copper; silver and copper, and many grain
combinations that the Turtles did not trade because of positions limits. 

Single Direction

 — The maximum number of total Units in one direction
long or short was 12 Units. Thus, one could theoretically have had 12 Units
long and 12 Units short at the same time. 

The  Turtles  used  the  term 

  to  represent  having  the  maximum
permitted  number  of  Units  for  a  given  risk  level.  Thus,  “loaded  in  yen”
meant having the maximum 4 units of Japanese Yen contracts. Completely
loaded meant having 12 Units, etc.

Adjusting Trading Size 

There will be times when the market does not trend for many months. During
these times, it is possible to lose a signiﬁcant percentage of the equity of the
account. 

After large winning trades close out, one might want to increase the size

of the equity used to compute position size. 

The Turtles did not trade normal accounts with a running balance based
on the initial equity. We were given notional accounts with a starting equity
of  zero  and  a  speciﬁc  account  size.  For  example,  many  Turtles  received  a
notional account size of $1,000,000 when we ﬁrst started trading in February
1983. This account size was then adjusted each year at the beginning of the
year. It was adjusted up or down depending on the success of the trader as
measured subjectively by Rich. The increase/decrease typically represented
something close to the addition of the gains or losses that were made in the
account during the preceding year.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

The Turtles were instructed to decrease the size of the notional account
by 20% each time we went down 10% of the original account. So if a Turtle
trading a $1,000,000 account was ever was down 10%, or $100,000, we would
then  begin  trading  as  if  we  had  a  $800,000  account  until  such  time  as  we
reached the yearly starting equity. If we lost another 10% (10% of $800,000
or $80,000 for a total loss of $180,000) we were to reduce the account size by
another 20% for a notional account size of $640,000. 

There  are  other,  perhaps  better  strategies  for  reducing  or  increasing
equity as the account goes up or down. These are simply the rules that the
Turtles used. 

Chapter 4
Entries 

The Turtles used two related system entries, each based on Donchian’s
channel breakout system. 

The typical trader thinks mostly in terms of the entry signals when thinking
about  a  particular  trading  system.  They  believe  that  the  entry  is  the  most
important aspect of any trading system. 

They might be very surprised to ﬁnd that the Turtles used a very simple
entry  system  based  on  the  Channel  Breakout  systems  taught  by  Richard
Donchian. 

The Turtles were given rules for two different but related breakout sys-
tems  we  called  System  1  and  System  2.  We  were  given  full  discretion  to
allocate as much of our equity to either system as we wanted. Some of us
chose to trade all our equity using System 2, some chose to use a 50% System
1, 50% System 2 split, while others chose different mixes. 

System 1
System 2

 — A shorter-term system based on a 20-day breakout 
 — A simpler long-term system based on a 55-day breakout. 

Breakouts 

A breakout is deﬁned as the price exceeding the high or low of a particular
number of days. Thus a 20-day breakout would be deﬁned as exceeding the
high or low of the preceding 20 days. 

Turtles always traded at the breakout when it was exceeded during the
day, and did not wait until the daily close or the open of the following day.
In the case of opening gaps, the Turtles would enter positions on the open
if a market opened through the price of the breakout. 

System 1 Entry

 — Turtles entered positions when the price exceeded by
a single tick the high or low of the preceding 20 days. If the price exceeded

the  20-day  high,  then  the  Turtles  would  buy  one  Unit  to  initiate  a  long
position in the corresponding commodity. If the price dropped one tick below
the low of the last 20 days, the Turtles would sell one Unit to initiate a short
position. 

System  1  breakout  entry  signals  would  be  ignored  if  the  last  breakout
would  have  resulted  in  a  winning  trade. 
  For  the  purposes  of  this  test,
the last breakout was considered the last breakout in the particular commodity
irrespective of whether or not that particular breakout was actually taken, or
was skipped because of this rule. This breakout would be considered a losing
breakout if the price subsequent to the date of the breakout moved 2N against
the position before a proﬁtable 10-day exit occurred. 

Note:

The direction of the last breakout was irrelevant to this rule. Thus, a losing
long  breakout  or  a  losing  short  breakout  would  enable  the  subsequent  new
breakout to be taken as a valid entry, regardless of its direction (long or short). 
However,  in  the  event  that  a  System  1  entry  breakout  was  skipped
because the previous trade had been a winner, an entry would be made at
the  55-day  breakout  to  avoid  missing  major  moves.  This  55-day  breakout
was considered the Failsafe Breakout point. 

At any given point, if you were out of the market, there would always
be some price which would trigger a short entry and another different and
higher  price  which  would  trigger  a  long  entry.  If  the  last  breakout  was  a
loser, then the entry signal would be closer to the current price (i.e., the 20
day breakout), than if it had been a winner, in which case the entry signal
would likely be farther away, at the 55-day breakout. 

System 2 Entry

 — Entered when the price exceeded by a single tick the
high or low of the preceding 55 days. If the price exceeded the 55-day high,
then the Turtles would buy one Unit to initiate a long position in the corre-
sponding commodity. If the price dropped one tick below the low of the last
55 days, the Turtles would sell one Unit to initiate a short position. 

All breakouts for System 2 would be taken whether the previous brea-

kout had been a winner or not. 

Adding Units

Turtles entered single Unit long positions at the breakouts and added to those
positions at

based  on  the  actual  ﬁll  price  of  the  previous  order.  So  if  an  initial  breakout
½

order slipped by 
½
to account for the 

 N slippage, plus the normal 

 N unit add interval.

This  would  continue  right  up  to  the  maximum  permitted  number  of
units. If the market moved quickly enough it was possible to add the max-
imum four Units in a single day.

Consistency 

The Turtles were told to be very consistent in taking entry signals, because
most of the proﬁts in a given year might come from only two or three large
winning trades. If a signal was skipped or missed, this could greatly affect
the returns for the year. 

The Turtles with the best trading records consistently applied the entry
rules. The Turtles with the worst records, and all those who were dropped
from  the  program,  failed  to  consistently  enter  positions  when  the  rules
indicated. 

Chapter 5
Stops 

The Turtles used N-based stops to avoid large losses in equity. 

There is an expression that, “There are old traders; and there are bold traders;
but  there  are  no  old  bold  traders.”  Traders  that  don’t  use  stops  go  broke.
The Turtles always used stops. 

For most people, it is far easier to cling to the hope that a losing trade
will turn around than it is to simply get out of a losing position and admit
that the trade did not work out.

Let  us  make  one  thing  very  clear.  Getting  out  of  a  losing  position  is
absolutely critical. Traders who do not cut their losses will not be successful
in the long term. Almost all of the examples of trading that got out of control
and jeopardized the health of the ﬁnancial institution itself, such as Barings,
Long-term  Capital  Management,  and  others,  involved  trades  that  were
allowed to develop into large losses because they were not cut short when
they were small losses. 

The most important thing about cutting your losses is to have predeﬁned
the point where you will get out, before you enter a position. If the market
moves  to  your  price,  you  must  get  out,  no  exceptions,  every  single  time.
Wavering from this method will eventually result in disaster. 

Turtle Stops 

Having  stops  didn’t  mean  that  the  Turtles  always  had  actual  stop  orders
placed with the broker. 

Since the Turtles carried such large positions, we did not want to reveal
our positions or our trading strategies by placing stop orders with brokers.
Instead,  we  were  encouraged  to  have  a  particular  price,  which  when  hit,
would  cause  us  to  exit  our  positions  using  either  limit  orders,  or  market
orders. 

These stops were non-negotiable exits. If a particular commodity traded
at the stop price, then the position was exited; each time, every time, without
fail. 

Stop Placement 

The Turtles placed their stops based on position risk. No trade could incur
more than 2% risk. 

Since  1  N  of  price  movement  represented  1%  of  Account  Equity,  the
maximum stop that would allow 2% risk would be 2 N of price movement.
Turtle  stops  were  set  at  2  N  below  the  entry  for  long  positions,  and  2  N
above the entry for short positions. 

In  order  to  keep  total  position  risk  at  a  minimum,  if  additional  units
were added, the stops for earlier units were raised by ½ N. This generally
meant that all the stops for the entire position would be placed at 2 N from
the  most  recently  added  unit.  However,  in  cases  where  later  units  were
placed  at  larger  spacing  either  because  of  fast  markets  causing  skid,  or
because of opening gaps, there would be differences in the stops.

Alternate Stop Strategy — The Whipsaw 

The  Turtles  were  told  of  an  alternate  stop  strategy  that  resulted  in  better
proﬁtability, but that was harder to execute because it incurred many more
losses, which resulted in a lower win/loss ratio. This strategy was called the
Whipsaw. 

Instead of taking a 2% risk on each trade, the stops were placed at ½ N
for  ½%  account  risk.  If  a  given  Unit  was  stopped  out,  the  Unit  would  be
re-entered if the market reached the original entry price. A few Turtles traded
this method with good success. 

The Whipsaw also had the added beneﬁt of not requiring the movement
of stops for earlier Units as new Units were added, since the total risk would
never exceed 2% at the maximum four Units.

Beneﬁts of the Turtle System Stops 

Since the Turtle’s stops were based on N, they adjusted to the volatility of
the markets. More volatile markets would have wider stops, but they would
also have fewer contracts per Unit. This equalized the risk across all entries
and resulted in better diversiﬁcation and a more robust risk management. 

Chapter 6
Exits 

The Turtles used breakout based exits for proﬁtable positions. 

There is another old saying: “you can never go broke taking a proﬁt.” The
Turtles would not agree with this statement. Getting out of winning positions
too early, i.e., “taking a proﬁt” too early, is one of the most common mistakes
when trading trend following systems. 

Prices never go straight up; therefore it is necessary to let the prices go
against you if you are going to ride a trend. Early in a trend this can often
mean  watching  decent  proﬁts  of  10%  to  30%  fade  to  a  small  loss.  In  the
middle of a trend, it might mean watching a proﬁt of 80% to 100% drop by
30% to 40%. The temptation to lighten the position to “lock in proﬁts” can
be very great.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

The Turtles knew that where you took a proﬁt could make the difference

between winning and losing. 

The Turtle System enters on breakouts. Most breakouts do not result in
trends. This means that most of the trades that the Turtles made resulted in
losses. If the winning trades did not earn enough on average to offset these
losses, the Turtles would have lost money. Every proﬁtable trading system
has a different optimal exit point. 

Consider the Turtle System; if you exit winning positions at a 1 N proﬁt
while  you  exited  losing  positions  at  a  2  N  loss  you  would  need  twice  as
many winners to offset the losses from the losing trades. 

There  is  a  complex  relationship  between  the  components  of  a  trading
system. This means that you can’t consider the proper exit for a proﬁtable
position without considering the entry, money management and other fac-
tors. 

The  proper  exit  for  winning  positions  is  one  of  the  most  important
aspects of trading, and the least appreciated. Yet it can make the difference
between winning and losing. 

Turtle Exits 

The  System  1  exit  was  a  10  day  low  for  long  positions  and  a  10  day  high
for short positions. All the Units in the position would be exited if the price
went against the position for a 10 day breakout. 

The System 2 exit was a 20 day low for long positions and a 20 day high
for short positions. All the Units in the position would be exited if the price
went against the position for a 20 day breakout. 

As with entries, the Turtles did not typically place exit stop orders, but
instead watched the price during the day, and started to phone in exit orders
as soon as the price traded through the exit breakout price. 

These Are Difﬁcult Exits 

For  most  traders,  the  Turtle  System  Exits  were  probably  the  single  most
difﬁcult part of the Turtle System Rules. Waiting for a 10 or 20 day new low
can often mean watching 20%, 40% even 100% of signiﬁcant proﬁts evapo-
rate. 

There is a very strong tendency to want to exit earlier. It requires great
discipline to watch your proﬁts evaporate in order to hold onto your posi-
tions for the really big move. The ability to maintain discipline and stick to
the  rules  during  large  winning  trades  is  the  hallmark  of  the  experienced
successful trader.

Tactics 

697

Miscellaneous guidelines to cover the rest of trading the Turtle System
Rules. 

The famous architect Mies van der Rohe, when speaking about restraint in
design, once said: “God is in the details.” This is also true of trading systems.
There are some important details which remain that can make a signiﬁcant
difference in the proﬁtability of your trading when using the Turtle Trading
Rules. 

Entering Orders 

As  has  been  mentioned  before,  Richard  Dennis  and  William  Eckhardt
advised the Turtles not to use stops when placing orders. We were advised
to watch the market and enter orders when the price hit our stop price. 

We  were  also  told  that,  in  general,  it  was  better  to  place  limit  orders
instead of market orders. This is because limit orders offer a chance for better
ﬁlls and less slippage than do market orders. 

Any market has at all times a bid and an ask. The bid is the price that
buyers are willing to buy at, and the ask is the price that sellers are willing
to  sell  at.  If  at  any  time  the  bid  price  becomes  higher  than  the  ask  price,
trading takes place. A market order will always ﬁll at the bid or ask when
there is sufﬁcient volume, and sometimes at a worse price for larger orders. 
Typically, there is a certain amount of relatively random price movement
that occurs, which is sometimes known as the bounce. The idea behind using
limit  orders  is  to  place  your  order  at  the  lower  end  of  the  bounce,  instead
of simply placing a market order. A limit order will not move the market if
it is a small order, and it will almost always move it less if it is a larger order. 
It takes some skill to be able to determine the best price for a limit order,
but  with  practice,  you  should  be  able  to  get  better  ﬁlls  using  limit  orders
placed near the market than with market orders. 

Fast Markets 

At  times,  the  market  moves  very  quickly  through  the  order  prices,  and  if
you place a limit order it simply won’t get ﬁlled. During fast market condi-
tions,  a  market  can  move  thousands  of  dollars  per  contract  in  just  a  few
minutes. 

During these times, the Turtles were advised not to panic, and to wait

for the market to trade and stabilize before placing their orders. 

Most beginning traders ﬁnd this hard to do. They panic and place market
orders.  Invariably  they  do  this  at  the  worst  possible  time,  and  frequently
end up trading on the high or low of the day, at the worst possible price.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

In  a  fast  market,  liquidity  temporarily  dries  up.  In  the  case  of  a  rising
fast market, sellers stop selling and hold out for a higher price, and they will
not re-commence selling until after the price stops moving up. In this sce-
nario, the asks rise considerably, and the spread between bid and ask widens. 
Buyers  are  now  forced  to  pay  much  higher  prices  as  sellers  continue
raising their asks, and the price eventually moves so far and so fast that new
sellers  come  into  the  market,  causing  the  price  to  stabilize,  and  often  to
quickly reverse and collapse partway back. 

Market orders placed into a fast market usually end up getting ﬁlled at
the highest price of the run-up, right at the point where the market begins
to stabilize as new sellers come in. 

As Turtles, we waited until some indication of at least a temporary price
reversal  before  placing  our  orders,  and  this  often  resulted  in  much  better
ﬁlls  than  would  have  been  achieved  with  a  market  order.  If  the  market
stabilized at a point which was past our stop price, then we would get out
of the market, but we would do so without panicking. 

Simultaneous Entry Signals 

Many days as traders there was little market movement, and little for us to
do besides monitor existing positions. We might go for days without placing
a single order. Other days would be moderately busy, with signals occurring
intermittently over the stretch of a few hours. In that case, we would simply
take the trades as they came, until they reached the position limits for those
markets. 

Then  there  were  days  when  it  seemed  like  everything  was  happening
at  once,  and  we  would  go  from  no  positions,  to  loaded,  in  a  day  or  two.
Often,  this  frantic  pace  was  intensiﬁed  by  multiple  signals  in  correlated
markets. 

This  was  especially  true  when  the  markets  gapped  open  through  the
entry  signals.  You  might  have  a  gap  opening  entry  signal  in  Crude  Oil,
Heating Oil and Unleaded Gas all on the same day. With futures contracts,
it was also extremely common for many different months of the same market
to signal at the same time. 

Buy Strength — Sell Weakness 

If the signals came all at once, we always bought the strongest markets and
sold short the weakest markets in a group. 

We would also only enter one unit in a single market at the same time.
For  instance,  instead  of  buying  February,  March  and April  Heating  Oil  at
the same time, we would pick the one contract month that was the strongest,
and that had sufﬁcient volume and liquidity. 

This is very important! Within a correlated group, the best long positions
are  the  strongest  markets  (which  almost  always  outperform  the  weaker

AU3772_book.fm  Page 699  Saturday, November 18, 2006  5:29 PM

Appendix E

699

markets in the same group). Conversely, the biggest winning trades to the
short side come from the weakest markets within a correlated group. 

As Turtles, we used various measures to determine strength and weak-
ness. The simplest and most common way was to simply look at the charts
and ﬁgure out which one “looked” stronger (or weaker) by visual exami-
nation. 

Some would determine how many N the price had advanced since the

breakout, and buy the market that had moved the most (in terms of N). 

Others  would  subtract  the  price  3  months  ago  from  the  current  price
and then divide by the current N to normalize across markets. The strongest
markets had the highest values; the weakest markets the lowest. 

Any of these approaches work well. The important thing is to have long
positions in the strongest markets and short positions in the weakest markets. 

Rolling Over Expiring Contracts 

When  futures  contracts  expire,  there  are  two  major  factors  that  need  to  be
considered before rolling over into a new contract. 

First,  there  are  many  instances  when  the  near  months  trend  well,  but
the more distant contracts fail to display the same level of price movement.
So don’t roll into a new contract unless its price action would have resulted
in an existing position. 

Second, contracts should be rolled before the volume and open interest
in the expiring contract decline too much. How much is too much depends
on the unit size. As a general rule, the Turtles rolled existing positions into
the new contract month a few weeks before expiration, unless the (currently
held) near month was performing signiﬁcantly better than farther out con-
tract months. 

Finally 

That concludes the Complete Turtle Trading System rules. As you are prob-
ably thinking, they are not very complicated. 

But  knowing  these  rules  is  not  enough  to  make  you  rich. You  have  to

be able to follow them. 

Remember  what  Richard  Dennis  said:  “I  always  say  that  you  could
publish my trading rules in the newspaper and no one would follow them.
The key is consistency and discipline. Almost anybody can make up a list
of  rules  that  are  80%  as  good  as  what  we  taught  our  people.  What  they
couldn’t  do  is  give  them  the  conﬁdence  to  stick  to  those  rules  even  when
things are going bad.” — From Market Wizards, by Jack D. Schwager. 

Perhaps  the  best  evidence  that  this  is  true  is  the  performance  of  the
Turtles themselves; many of them did not make money. This was not because
the rules didn’t work; it was because they could not and did not follow the
rules.  By  virtue  of  this  same  fact,  few  who  read  this  document  will  be

AU3772_book.fm  Page 700  Saturday, November 18, 2006  5:29 PM

successful  trading  the  Turtle  Trading  Rules. Again;  this  is  not  because  the
rules don’t work. It is because the reader simply won’t have the conﬁdence
to follow them. 

The  Turtle  rules  are  very  difﬁcult  to  follow  because  they  depend  on
capturing relatively infrequent large trends. As a result, many months can
pass  between  winning  periods;  at  times  even  a  year  or  two.  During  these
periods it is easy to come up with reasons to doubt the system, and to stop
following the rules: 

What if the rules don’t work anymore? What if the markets have changed? 

What if there is something important missing from the rules? 

How can I be really sure that this works? 

One member of the ﬁrst Turtles class, who was ﬁred from the program
before the end of the ﬁrst year, suspected early on that information had been
intentionally  withheld  from  the  group,  and  eventually  became  convinced
that there were hidden secrets which Rich would not reveal. This particular
trader could  not  face  up  to  the  simple  fact  that  his  poor  performance  was
due  to  his  own  doubts  and  insecurities,  which  resulted  in  his  inability  to
follow the rules. 

Another problem is the tendency to want to change the rules. Many of
the Turtles, in an effort to reduce the risk of trading the system, changed the
rules in subtle ways which sometimes had the opposite of the desired effect. 
An example: Failing to enter positions as quickly as the rules specify (1
unit every ½ N). While this may seem like a more conservative approach, the
reality could be that, for the type of entry system the Turtles used, adding to
positions  slowly  might  increase  the  chance  that  a  retracement  would  hit  the
exit stops — resulting in losses — whereas a faster approach might allow the
position to weather the retracement without the stops being hit. This subtle
change could have a major impact on the proﬁtability of the system during
certain market conditions. 

In order to build the level of conﬁdence you will need to follow a trading
system’s rules, whether it is the Turtle System, something similar, or a com-
pletely different system, it is imperative that you personally conduct research
using  historical  trading  data.  It  is  not  enough  to  hear  from  others  that  a
system works; it is not enough to read the summary results from research
conducted by others. You must do it yourself. 

Get your hands dirty and get directly involved in the research. Dig into
the trades, look at the daily equity logs, get very familiar with the way the
system trades, and with the extent and frequency of the losses. 

It is much easier to weather an 8-month losing period if you know that
there  have  been  many  periods  of  equivalent  length  in  the  last  20  years.  It
will  be  much  easier  to  add  to  positions  quickly  if  you  know  that  adding
quickly is a key part of the proﬁtability of the system.

Further Study 

701

Where do you go from here? There is no substitute for experience. 

The humorist Barry Le Platner said: “Good judgment comes from experience,
and experience comes from bad judgment.” If you want to become a trader,
you must start to trade. There is no substitute. You must also make mistakes. 
Making mistakes is part of trading. If you don’t start trading using actual
money  —  and  enough  money  that  it  affects  you  when  you  win  or  lose  —
you won’t learn all the lessons of trading. Paper trading is not a substitute
for trading with real money. If you aren’t using real money, you won’t learn
how hope, fear, and greed affect you personally. 

At the same time, it is important to get a thorough understanding of the
fundamentals of trading. Armed with this knowledge you will make fewer
mistakes, and you will learn much more quickly from the mistakes that you
do make. 

Here are some suggested areas for further study: 

Trading Psychology 

Trading psychology is the most important aspect of trading, and understand-
ing yourself and your own personality as it relates to your trading is critical.
This journey is much more about making a sincere and open-minded attempt
to  understand  your  own  personal  psychology  than  it  is  about  ﬁnding  the
magic psychology book with all the answers. 

Money Management 

Money  management  is  the  most  important  aspect  of  a  mechanical  trading
system. Controlling risk in a manner that will allow you to continue trading
through the inevitable bad periods, and survive to realize the proﬁt potential
of good systems, is absolutely fundamental. Yet, the interplay between entry
signals,  exits  and  money  management  is  often  non-intuitive.  Study  and
research into the state-of-the-art in money management will pay enormous
dividends. 

Trading Research 

There is no substitute for statistically valid historical research when devel-
oping mechanical trading systems. In practice, this means learning how to
program a computer to run simulations of trading system performance. 

There  is  a  lot  of  good  information  on  curve-ﬁtting,  over-optimization,
trading  statistics  and  testing  methodologies  on  the  web  and  in  books,  but
the information is a bit hard to ﬁnd amongst the hype and bull. Be skeptical,
but keep an open mind, and your research will pay off.

Final Warning 

There are a lot of individuals who try to sell themselves and their advice as
“expert.”  Don’t  blindly  accept  the  advice  of  these  self-proclaimed  experts.
The best advice comes from those who aren’t selling it, and who make their
money  trading.  There  are  many  books  and  biographies  that  give  insights
into the habits of those who have been — or who are — successful traders. 
Learning how to become a good trader — or even an excellent trader —
is possible, but it requires a lot of hard work and a healthy dose of skepticism.
For  those  of  us  who  have  chosen  this  path,  the  journey  never  ends.  Those
who  continue  to  be  successful  will  never  reach  their  destination,  but  will
learn to ﬁnd joy in the journey itself.

List of Illustrations and Text Diagrams

Regarding the illustrations in this book, except for those which are marked
as adapted from other sources, the charts listed as Figures below have been
reproduced  from  the  authors’  own  “working”  charts.  As  such,  they  were
made  up  originally  for  private  use  only  and  without  a  thought  to  their
eventual reproduction, much less their publication. They are not and do not
pretend  to  be  works  of  art,  but  it  is  hoped  that  they  will,  despite  their
“homemade” appearance, serve the purpose of illustrating the various for-
mations, patterns, market phenomena, and trading principles discussed in
the  text.  That  they  do  not  show  the  clean  line  and  expert  lettering  of  a
professional draftsman’s work is regretted. The reader will, we trust, make
allowances.

As for their selection, it should be stated most emphatically that it was
not  necessary  to  search  through  thousands  of  charts  in  order  to  ﬁnd  good
examples of all these various technical formations. Many dozens, even hun-
dreds, were available for practically every type of pattern. Anyone who has
learned  to  recognize  them  can  ﬁnd  for  himself  plenty  of  good  technical
pictures  in  a  quick  examination  of  even  as  small  a  portfolio  as  50  or  100
charts. In other words, the illustrations in this book are in no sense unique.
In selecting them, we have tried only to show as much variety as possible
(EN: up to the year 2005)
and samples from previous as well as more recent 
market history.

Perhaps  it  is  not  necessary,  but  it  is  at  least  in  accord  with  custom,  to
add that the information as to speciﬁc market prices, volume of transactions,
etc., used in preparing our illustrations (or cited in the text of this book) has
been derived from sources believed to be reliable, but is not guaranteed.

Glossary

EN:  The  Glossary  is  the  work  of  the  distinguished  editor  of  the  seventh  edition,
Richard McDermott. Minor changes are so noted.

EN9: Some entries are written by other analysts, whose names are noted.

While it requires the use of the human brain and some discrimination and judgment
the great virtue of Magee chart analysis is that it allows the practitioner to evaluate
how  well  number  driven  indicators  function.  As,  for  example,  use  of  a  moving
average to identify the trend works wonderfully well in a trending market. And, if
used  as  a  signal  generator  in  a  trading  market  results  in  whip-saws.  Similarly,
oscillators often are useful in trading markets, but can mislead the trader when the
market  begins  to  trend.  The  reasonably  accomplished  chart  analyst  can  recognize
the state of the market and view the performance of number driven indicators from
a more informed perspective. Thus the reader should keep this in mind while reading
about ADXs and suchlike.

ACCUMULATION  —  The  ﬁrst  phase  of  a  Bull  Market.  The  period  when
farsighted  investors  begin  to  buy  shares  from  discouraged  or  distressed
sellers.  Financial  reports  are  usually  at  their  worst  and  the  public  is  com-
pletely disgusted with the stock market. Volume is only moderate, but begin-
ning to increase on the rallies.

ACTIVITY — See Volume.

ADX (Average Directional Movement Index) — The ADX is a trend-follow-
ing  indicator  devised  by  Welles  Wilder  (RSI  Wilder)  and  is  based  on  the
concept  of  directional  movement.  It  is  designed  to  evaluate  the  trending
characteristics of a security. The ADX is frequently used to avoid trendless
markets,  and  signals  when  a  trend  reaches  a  proﬁtable  trading  level.  In  a
trendless market, the ADX indicates avoidance.

Directional  movement  is  a  measure  of  the  net  total  price  movement
during  a  set  period  of  time.  First,  the  positive  and  negative  directional
movements are determined by summing the daily up and down moves. The
values obtained are next normalized by dividing them by the “True Range,”
the absolute value of the total move for the period; this difference between
normalized values (expressed as a percentage) is the directional movement. 
The  ADX  is  then  obtained  from  directional  movement  by  the  use  of
exponential average and ratios. The ADX is often charted with a second line,
the ADXR Indicator. ADXR is a smoothed average of the ADX. 

A rising ADX indicates signiﬁcant directional movement and the begin-
ning of a good trading period. The declining ADX is shown during a poor
period  for  trend  following.  Normally,  an  ADX  Indicator  above  25  signals
signiﬁcant directional movement and good trading.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

APEX — The highest point; the pointed end, tip, of a Triangle.

ARBITRAGE — The simultaneous buying and selling of two different, but
closely  related  instruments  to  take  advantage  of  a  disparity  in  their  prices
EN: Those who buy the acquirer and sell the
in one market or different markets. 
acquired  in  takeover  situations  —  sometimes  called  “arbs”  or  arbitrageurs  —  are
ersatz or faux arbitrageurs. They are really spreaders. Arbitrageur is a solecism used
in that sense. It is also a false cognate to the French.

AREA GAP — See Common Gap.

AREA  PATTERN  —  When  a  stock  or  commodity’s  upward  or  downward
momentum  has  been  temporarily  exhausted,  the  ensuing  sideways  move-
ment in the price usually traces out a design or arrangement of form called
an Area Pattern. The shape of some of these Area Patterns, or Formations,
have predictive value under certain conditions. (See also Ascending Triangle,
Broadening  Formations,  Descending  Triangle,  Diamond,  Flag,
Head-and-Shoulders,  Inverted  Triangle,  Pennant,  Rectangle,  Right-Angle
Triangles, Symmetrical Triangles, and Wedges.)

ARITHMETIC  SCALE  —  Price  or  volume  scale  where  the  distance  on  the
vertical axis (i.e., space between horizontal lines) represents equal amounts
of dollars or number of shares.

ASCENDING  (PARALLEL)  TREND  CHANNEL  —  When  the  tops  of  the
rallies  composing  an  advance  develop  along  a  line  (sometimes  called  a
Return  Line),  which  is  also  parallel  to  the  basic  up  trendline  (i.e.,  the  line
which slopes up across the wave bottoms in an advance); the area between
the two lines is called an Ascending or Up Channel.

ASCENDING (UP) TRENDLINE — The advancing wave in a stock or com-
modity is composed of a series of ripples. When the bottoms of these ripples
form on, or very close to, an upward slanting straight line, a basic Ascending
or Up Trendline is formed.

ASCENDING  TRIANGLE  —  One  of  a  class  of  Area  Patterns  called
Right-Angle Triangles. The class is distinguished by the fact that one of the
two boundary lines is practically horizontal, while the other slants toward
it. If the top line is horizontal and the lower slants upward to an intersection
point  to  the  right,  the  resulting Area  Pattern  is  called Ascending  Triangle.
The implication is bullish, with the expectant breakout through the horizon-
tal line. Measuring Formula: add the broadest part of triangle to the breakout
point.

AT-THE-MONEY  —  An  option,  the  strike  price  of  which  is  equal  to  the
market price of the underlying instrument.

AVERAGES  —  See  Dow–Jones  Industrial  Averages,  Moving  Averages,
Dow–Jones Transportation Averages, and Dow–Jones Utility Averages.

AVERAGING  COST  — An  investing  technique  where  the  investor  buys  a
stock or commodity at successively lower prices, thereby “averaging down”
his  average  cost  of  each  stock  share  or  commodity  contract.  Purchases  at
successively higher prices would “average up” the price of stock shares or
commodity contracts. 

EN: A very foolish technique for the amateur.

AXIS — In the graphic sense, an axis is a straight line for measurement or
reference.  It  is  also  the  line,  real  or  imagined,  on  which  a  formation  is
regarded as rotating.

BALANCED PROGRAM — Proportioning capital, or a certain part of capital,
equally between the long side and the short side of the market.

BAR CHART — Also called a Line Chart. A graphic representation of prices
using  a  vertical  bar  to  connect  the  highest  price  in  the  time  period  to  the
lowest  price.  Opening  prices  are  noted  with  a  small  horizontal  line  to  the
left. Closing prices are shown with a small horizontal line to the right. Bar
charts can be constructed for any time period in which prices are available.
The most common time periods found in bar charts are hourly, daily, weekly,
and  monthly.  However,  with  the  growing  number  of  personal  computers
and the availability of “real-time” quotes, it is not unusual for traders to use
some period of minutes to construct a bar chart.

BASIC TRENDLINES — See Trendlines.

BASING POINT — The price level in the chart which determines where a
stop-loss point is placed. As technical conditions change, the Basing Point,
and  stops,  can  be  advanced  (in  a  rising  market),  or  lowered  (in  a  falling
market). (See Progressive Stops.)

BASIS  POINTS  —  The  measure  of  yields  on  bonds  and  notes.  One  Basis
Point equals 0.01% of yield.

BASKET  TRADES  —  Large  transactions  made  up  of  a  number  of  various
stocks.

BEAR  MARKET  —  In  its  simplest  form,  a  Bear  Market  is  a  period  when
prices are primarily declining, usually for a long period of time. Bear Markets
generally consist of three phases. The ﬁrst phase is distribution, the second
is panic, and the third is akin to a washout, where those investors who have
held through the ﬁrst two phases ﬁnally give up and liquidate.

BENT NECKLINE — See Neckline.

BETA  —  A  measurement  of  an  individual  stock’s  sensitivity  to  market
swings.

BETA (COEFFICIENT) — A measure of the market or nondiversiﬁable risk
associated with any given security in the market.

BLOCK TRADES — Large transactions of a particular stock sold as a unit.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

BLOW-OFF — See Climactic Top.

BLUE CHIPS — The nickname given to high-priced companies with good
records  of  earnings  and  price  stability.  Also  called  gilt-edged  securities.
Examples: IBM, AT&T, General Motors, and General Electric.

BLUE PARALLEL — A line drawn parallel to the trendline (Blue Trendline)
which connects at least two highs. The Blue Parallel is started off a low and
used to estimate the next low point.

BLUE TRENDLINE — A straight line connecting two or more Tops together.
To avoid confusion, Edwards and Magee use a blue line for Top Trendlines
and a red line for Bottom Trendlines.

BOLLINGER BANDS (BB) — An envelope, in the form of two lines, which
surrounds the price bars on a chart. Bollinger Bands are plotted two standard
deviations away from a Simple Moving Average. This is the primary differ-
ence between Bollinger Bands and other envelopes. Envelopes are plotted a
ﬁxed percentage above and below a Moving Average. As standard deviation
is  a  measure  of  volatility,  Bollinger  Bands  adjust  themselves  to  differing
market  conditions.  The  bands  grow  wider  during  volatile  market  periods
and narrower during less volatile periods. 

Bollinger’s premise is to ask the market what it is doing, rather than tell
it what to do. He focused on volatility with the use of standard deviation to
set  the  band  width.  The  bands  are  normally  plotted  two  deviations  away
from the standard deviation, which is effectively a 20-day Moving Average
Line.  The  plot  is  valid  if  an  average  acts  as  a  Support  Line  on  market
corrections. If the average is penetrated on corrections, it is too short. Bol-
linger recommends 10-day Moving Averages for short-term trading, 20-day
for  intermediate-term  trading,  and  50-day  for  longer-term  trading.  Devia-
tions also need to be adjusted: 10 days can use 1.5 deviations, 20 days use
two deviations, and 50 days use 2.5 deviations. The nature of the time periods
does not matter; the bands can be used on monthly, weekly, daily, and even
intraday ﬁgures. 

Bollinger Bands do not usually generate buy and sell signals alone. Most
often they provide a framework within which price may be related to other
indicators.  Bollinger  recommends  using  the  bands  in  relation  to  other  buy
and sell signals. However, the bands can be an integral part of the signal. If
a price touches an upper band and indicator action conﬁrms it, no sell signal
is  generated  (it  is  a  continuation  signal  if  a  buy  signal  was  in  effect).  If  a
price touches an upper band and an indicator does not conﬁrm (diverges),
it is a sell signal. If a Top Price Chart Formation is formed outside the bands
and is followed by a second Top inside the bands, a sell signal is generated.
The exact opposite is true on the buy side. 

When  combined  with  other  indicators,  such  as  the  RSI,  the  Bollinger
Bands become quite powerful. RSI is an excellent indicator with respect to
overbought  and  oversold  conditions.  Generally,  when  price  touches  the

747

upper Bollinger Band and RSI is below 70, it is an indication that the trend
will continue. Conversely, when price touches the lower Bollinger Band, and
RSI is above 30, it is an indication the trend should continue. If a situation
occurs  where  price  touches  the  upper  Bollinger  Band  and  RSI  is  above  70
(possibly approaching 80), it is an indication that the trend may reverse itself
and move downward. On the other hand, if price touches the lower Bollinger
Band and RSI is below 30 (possibly approaching 20), the trend may reverse
itself and move upward. (See also Multicolincarity, Percent B, Wilder RSI.)

BOOK VALUE — The conventional accounting measure of what a stock is
worth based on the value of the company’s assets less the company’s debt.
Eminently manipulable.

BOTTOM  —  See  Ascending  Triangle,  Dormant  Bottom,  Double  Bottom,
Head-and-Shoulders Bottom, Rounding Bottom, and Selling Climax.

BOUNDARY — The edges of a pattern.

BOWL — See Rounding Bottom.

BRACKETING — A trading range market or a price area that is nontrending.

BREAKAWAY GAP — The hole or gap in the chart created when a stock or
commodity breaks out of an Area Pattern.

BREAKOUT — When a stock or commodity exits an area pattern.

BROADENING FORMATION — Sometimes called Inverted Triangles, these
are formations which start with narrow ﬂuctuations that widen out between
diverging,  rather  than  converging,  boundary  lines.  (See  also  Right-Angled
Broadening  Formations,  Broadening  Top,  Head-and-Shoulders,  and  Dia-
mond Patterns.)

BROADENING TOP — An Area Reversal Pattern which may evolve in any
one of three forms, comparable in shape, respectively, to inverted Symmet-
rical,  Ascending,  or  Descending  Triangles.  Unlike  Triangles,  however,  the
Tops and Bottoms of these patterns do not necessarily stop at clearly marked
diverging  boundary  lines.  Volume,  rather  than  diminishing  in  triangles,
tends  to  be  unusually  high  and  irregular  throughout  pattern  construction.
No Measuring Formula is available.

BULL MARKET — A period when prices are primarily rising, normally for
an extended period. Usually, but not always, divisible into three phases. The
ﬁrst phase is accumulation. The second phase is one of fairly steady advance
with increasing volume. The third phase is marked by considerable activity
as the public begins to recognize and attempt to proﬁt from the rising market.

CALL  OPTION  —  An  option  that  gives  the  buyer  the  right  to  buy  the
underlying  contract  at  a  speciﬁc  price  within  a  certain  period,  and  that
obligates  the  seller  to  sell  the  contract  for  the  premium  received  before
expiration of the designated time period.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

CANDLESTICKS  —  A  Japanese  graphical  representation  of  price  action
using the same data as bar charts, but which adds color to the candlestick
(or  data)  to  indicate  the  direction  of  prices  from  the  opening.  Cf.  Nison,
Bibliography.

CATS AND DOGS — Low-priced stocks of no investment value.

CHANNEL — If the Tops of the rallies and Bottoms of the reactions develop
lines which are approximately parallel to one another, the area between these
lines  is  called  a  Channel.  (See  also Ascending  Trend  Channel,  Descending
Trend Channel, and Horizontal Trend Channel.)

CHART  —  A  graphic  representation  of  a  stock  or  commodity  in  terms  of
price and/or volume. (See also Bar Chart and Point & Figure Chart.)

CLEAN-OUT DAY — See Selling Climax.

CLIMACTIC TOP — A sharp advance, accompanied by extraordinary vol-
ume, i.e., much larger volume than the normal increase, which signals the
ﬁnal “blow-off” of the trend, followed by either a Reversal, or at least by a
period of stagnation, formation of Consolidation Pattern, or a Correction.

CLIMAX DAY — See One-Day Reversal.

CLIMAX, SELLING — See Selling Climax.

CLOSING PRICE — The last sale price of the trading session for a stock. In
a commodity, it represents an ofﬁcial price determined from a range of prices
deemed to have traded at or on the close; also called a settlement price.

CLOSING THE GAP — When a stock or commodity returns to a previous
gap and retraces the range of the gap. Also called covering the gap or ﬁlling
the gap. (See also Gap.)

COIL — Another term for a Symmetrical Triangle.

COMMISSION — The amount charged by a brokerage house to execute a
trade in a stock, option, or commodity. In a stock, option, or commodity, a
commission is charged for each purchase and each sale. In a commodity, a
commission is charged only when the original entry trade has been closed
with an offsetting trade. This is called a round turn commission.

COMMON  GAP  —  Also  called  Area  Gap.  Any  hole  or  gap  in  the  chart
occurring within an Area Pattern. The forecasting signiﬁcance of the Com-
mon Gap is nil. (See also Gap.)

COMPARATIVE RELATIVE STRENGTH — Compares the price movement
of a stock with that of its competitors, industry group, or the whole market.

COMPLEX  HEAD-AND-SHOULDERS  —  Also  called  Multiple
Head-and-Shoulders. It is a Head-and-Shoulders Pattern with more than one
right and left shoulder and/or head. (See also Head-and-Shoulders.)

COMPOSITE  AVERAGE  —  A  stock  average  composed  of  the  65  stocks
which make  up  the  Dow–Jones  Industrial  Average  and  the  Dow–Jones
Utility Average.

COMPOSITE  LEVERAGE  —  In  Edwards  and  Magee,  it  is  a  formula  for
combining  the  principal  factors  affecting  a  given  sum  of  capital  used  (i.e.,
sensitivity, price, and margin) into one index ﬁgure.

CONFIRMATION  —  In  a  pattern,  it  is  the  point  at  which  a  stock  or  com-
modity exits an Area Pattern in the expected direction by an amount of price
 bona ﬁde
and volume sufﬁcient to meet minimum pattern requirements for a
breakout. In the Dow Theory, it means both the Industrial Average and the
Transportation Average have registered new highs or lows during the same
advance or decline. If only one of the Averages establishes a new high (or
low) and the other one does not, it would be a nonconﬁrmation, or Diver-
gence.  This  is  also  true  of  oscillators.  To  conﬁrm  a  new  high  (or  low)  in  a
stock or commodity, an oscillator needs to reach a new high (or low) as well.
Failure of the oscillator to conﬁrm a new high (or low) is called a Divergence
and  would  be  considered  an  early  indication  of  a  potential  Reversal  in
direction.

CONGESTION — The sideways trading from which Area Patterns evolve.
Not all Congestion periods produce a recognizable pattern, however.

CONSOLIDATION PATTERN — Also called a Continuation Pattern, it is an
Area  Pattern  which  breaks  out  in  the  direction  of  the  previous  trend.  (See
also  Ascending  Triangle,  Descending  Triangle,  Hag,  Head-and-Shoulders
Continuation, Pennant, Rectangle, Scallop, and Symmetrical Triangle.)

CONTINUATION GAP — See Runaway Gap.

CONTINUATION PATTERN — See Consolidation Pattern.

CONVERGENT  PATTERN  (TREND)  —  Those  patterns  with  upper  and
lower boundary lines which meet, or converge, at some point if extended to
the  right.  (See  also Ascending  Triangle,  Descending  Triangle,  Symmetrical
Triangle, Wedges, and Pennants.)

CORRECTION — A move in a commodity or stock which is opposite to the
prevailing trend, but not sufﬁcient to change that trend. Called a rally in a
downtrend and a reaction in an uptrend. In the Dow Theory, a Correction
is a Secondary Trend against the Primary Trend, which usually lasts from 3
weeks to 3 months and retraces from one third to two thirds of the preceding
swing in the Primary Direction.

COVERING THE GAP — See Closing the Gap.

CRADLE  —  The  intersection  of  the  two  converging  boundary  lines  of  a
Symmetrical Triangle. (See also Apex.)

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

DAILY  RANGE  —  The  difference  between  the  high  and  low  price  during
one trading day.

DEMAND — Buying interest for a stock at a given price.

DESCENDING (PARALLEL) TREND CHANNEL — When the Bottoms of
the reactions comprising a decline develop along a line (sometimes called a
Return Line), which is also parallel to the basic down trendlines (i.e., the line
which slopes down across the wave tops in a decline), the area between the
two lines is called a Descending or Down Channel.

DESCENDING TRENDLINE — The declining wave in a stock or commodity
is composed of a series of ripples. When the tops of these ripples form on,
or  very  close  to,  a  downward  slanting  straight  line,  a  basic  Descending  or
Down Trendline is formed.

DESCENDING  TRIANGLE  —  One  of  a  class  of  Area  Patterns  called
Right-Angle Triangles. The class is distinguished by the fact that one of the
two boundary lines is practically horizontal, while the other slants toward
it.  If  the  bottom  line  is  horizontal  and  the  upper  slants  downward  to  an
intersection point to the right, the resulting Area Pattern is called a Descend-
ing Triangle. The implication is Bearish, with the expectant breakout through
the  ﬂat  (horizontal)  side.  Minimum  Measuring  Formula:  add  the  broadest
part of the Triangle to the breakout point.

DIAMOND  —  Usually  a  Reversal  Pattern,  but  it  will  also  be  found  as  a
Continuation Pattern. It could be described as a Complex Head-and-Shoul-
ders Pattern with a V-shaped (bent) Neckline, or a Broadening Pattern which,
after two or three swings, changes into a regular Triangle. The overall shape
is a four-point Diamond. Since it requires a fairly active market, it is more
often  found  at  Major  Tops.  Many  Complex  Head-and-Shoulders  Tops  are
borderline Diamond Patterns. The major difference is in the right side of the
pattern. It should clearly show two converging lines with diminishing vol-
ume  as  in  a  Symmetrical  Triangle.  Minimum  Measuring  Formula:  add  the
greatest width of the pattern to the breakout point.

DISTRIBUTION — The ﬁrst phase of a Bear Market, which really begins in
the last stage of a Bull Market. The period when farsighted investors sense
that  the  market  has  outrun  its  fundamentals  and  begin  to  unload  their
holdings at an increasing pace. Trading volume is still high; however, it tends
to diminish on rallies. The public is still active, but beginning to show signs
of caution as hoped-for proﬁts fade away.

DIVERGENCE — When new highs (or lows) in one indicator are not realized
in another comparable indicator. (See also Conﬁrmation.)

DIVERGENT PATTERN (TREND) — Those patterns with upper and lower
boundary  lines  which  meet  at  some  point  if  extended  to  the  left.  (See  also
Broadening Formation.)

DIVERSIFICATION — The concept of placing your funds in different indus-
try  groups  and  investment  vehicles  to  spread  risk.  Not  to  put  all  your
ﬁnancial eggs in one basket.

DIVIDENDS — A share of the proﬁts, in cash or stock equivalent, which is
paid to stockholders.

DORMANT BOTTOM — A variation of a Rounding (Bowl) Bottom, but in
an  extended,  ﬂat-bottomed  form.  It  usually  appears  in  “thin”  stocks,  (i.e.,
those issues with a small number of shares outstanding) and characteristi-
cally will show lengthy periods during which no sales will be registered for
days at a time. The chart will appear “ﬂy-specked” due to the missing days.
The technical implication is for an upside breakout.

DOUBLE BOTTOM — Reversal Pattern. A Bottom formed on relatively high
volume  which  is  followed  by  a  rally  (of  at  least  15%),  and  then  a  second
Bottom (possibly rounded) at the same level (plus or minus 3%) as the ﬁrst
Bottom  on  lower  volume. A  rally  back  though  the  apex  of  the  intervening
rally  conﬁrms  the  Reversal.  More  than  a  month  should  separate  the  two
Bottoms. Minimum Measuring Formula: take the distance from the lowest
bottom to the apex of the intervening rally and add it to the apex.

DOUBLE TOP — A high-volume Top is formed, followed by a reaction (of
at least 15%) on diminishing activity. Another rally back to the previous high
(plus  or  minus  3%)  is  made,  but  on  lower  volume  than  the  ﬁrst  high.  A
decline through the low of the reaction conﬁrms the Reversal. The two highs
should be more than a month apart. Minimum Measuring Formula: add to
the  breakout  point  the  distance  from  the  highest  peak  to  the  low  of  the
reaction. Also called an “M” Formation.

DOUBLE TRENDLINE — When two relatively close Parallel Trendlines are
needed to deﬁne the true trend pattern. (See also Trendline.)

DOW–JONES  INDUSTRIAL  AVERAGE  —  Developed  by  Charles  Dow  in
1885  to  study  market  trends.  Originally  composed  of  14  companies  (12
railroads and 2 industrials), the rails, by 1897, were separated into their own
Average, and 12 industrial companies of the day were selected for the Indus-
trial Average.  The  number  was  increased  to  20  in  1916,  and  to  30  in  1928.
The  stocks  included  in  this Average  have  been  changed  from  time  to  time
to keep the list up to date, or to accommodate a merger. The only original
issue still in the Average is General Electric.

DOW–JONES TRANSPORTATION AVERAGE — Established at the turn of
the century with the new Industrial Average, it was originally called the Rail
Average  and  was  composed  of  20  railroad  companies.  With  the  advent  of
the airlines industry, the Average was updated in 1970 and the name changed
to Transportation Average.

DOWNTICK — A securities transaction which is at a price that is lower than
the preceding transaction.

DOWNTREND — See Descending Trendline and Trend.

DRAWDOWN or RETRACEMENT — The ebb, or loss, of a portfolio’s equity

shares of the underlying security.

EXHAUSTION GAP — Relatively wide gap in the price of a stock or com-
modity which occurs near the end of a strong directional move in the price.
These  gaps  are  quickly  closed,  most  often  within  2  to  5  days,  which  helps
to distinguish them from Runaway Gaps, which are not usually covered for
a considerable length of time. An Exhaustion Gap cannot be read as a Major
Reversal,  or  even  necessarily  a  Reversal.  It  signals  a  halt  in  the  prevailing
trend, which is ordinarily followed by some sort of area pattern development.

EXPIRATION — The last day on which an option can be exercised.

EXPONENTIAL  SMOOTHING  —  A  mathematical  method  of  forecasting
which  assumes  future  price  action  may  be  forecast  by  using  a  weighted
average  of  past  periods;  a  mathematical  series  in  which  greater  weight  is
given to more recent price action. A method of trend identiﬁcation.

FALLING WEDGE — An Area Pattern with two downward slanting, con-
verging trendlines. Normally, it takes more than 3 weeks to complete, and
volume  will  diminish  as  prices  move  toward  the  apex  of  the  pattern.  The
anticipated  direction  of  the  breakout  in  a  Falling  Wedge  is  up.  Minimum
Measuring Formula: a retracement of all the ground lost within the Wedge.
(See also Wedge.)

FALSE  BREAKOUT  or  FALSE  SIGNAL—  A  breakout  which  is  conﬁrmed
but which quickly reverses and eventually leads the stock or commodity to
a breakout in the opposite direction. Indistinguishable from premature brea-
kout or genuine breakout when it occurs.

FAN  LINES  —  A  set  of  three  secondary  trendlines  drawn  from  the  same
starting high or low, which spread out in a Fan shape. In a Primary Uptrend,
the fan would be along the tops of the Secondary (Intermediate) Reaction.
In a Primary Downtrend, the fan would be along the bottoms of the Second-
ary  (Intermediate)  Rally.  When  the  third  Fan  Line  is  broken,  it  signals  the
resumption of the Primary Trend.

50-DAY MOVING AVERAGE LINE — Is determined by taking the closing

average  for  n  days  consists  of  summing  prices  for  n  days  and  dividing  by  n.  On
n+1 drop the ﬁrst day and add the new day to the formula, etc.

FIVE-POINT REVERSAL — See Broadening Pattern.

FLAG — A Continuation Pattern. A ﬂag is a period of congestion, less than
4 weeks in duration, which forms after a sharp, near vertical, change in price.
The upper and lower boundary lines of the pattern are parallel, though both
may  slant  up,  down,  or  sideways.  In  an  uptrend,  the  pattern  resembles  a
Flag ﬂying from a mast, hence the name. Flags are also called Measuring or
HalfMast Patterns because they tend to form at the midpoint of the rally or
reaction.  Volume  tends  to  diminish  during  the  formation,  and  increase  on
the  breakout.  Minimum  Measuring  Formula:  add  the  distance  from  the
breakout point, which started the preceding “Mast” rally or reaction, to the
breakout point of the Flag.

FLOATING  SUPPLY  —  The  number  of  shares  available  for  trading  at  any
given time. Generally, the outstanding number of shares less shares closely
held and likely to be unavailable to the public. Shares of a company held by
its  employee  pension  fund,  for  example,  would  not  generally  enter  the
trading stream and could be subtracted from the outstanding shares.

FORMATION — See Area Pattern.

FRONT-MONTH — The ﬁrst expiration month in a series of months.

FUNDAMENTALS — Information on a stock pertaining to the business of
the company and how it relates to earnings and dividends. In a commodity,
it would be information on any factor which would affect supply or demand.
EN:  Also,  earnings,  proﬁts,  proﬁt  margins,  cash  ﬂow,  sales,  and  other  statistics
sometimes used to obfuscate the value of the issue.

GAP — A hole in the price range which occurs when either (1) the lowest
price  at  which  a  stock  or  commodity  is  traded  during  any  time  period  is
higher than the highest price at which it was traded on the preceding time
period, or (2) the highest price of one time period is lower than the lowest

price of the preceding time period. When the ranges of the two time periods
are plotted, they will not overlap or touch the same horizontal level on the
chart — there will be a price gap between them. (See also Common or Area
Gap,  Ex-Dividend  Gap,  Breakaway  Gap,  Runaway  Gap,  Exhaustion  Gap,
and Island Reversal.)

GRAPH — See Chart.

HALF-MAST: — See Flag. Edwards said “The ﬂag ﬂies at half-mast” refer-
ring  to  the  tendency  of  prices  to  consolidate  half  way  through  a  surging
vertical run.

HEAD-AND-SHOULDERS PATTERN — Although occasionally an Inverted
Head-and-Shoulders  Pattern  (called  a  Consolidation  Head-and-Shoulders)
will form, which is a Continuation Pattern, in its normal form, this pattern
is one of the more common and more reliable of the Major Reversal Patterns.
It  consists  of  the  following  four  elements  (a  Head-and-Shoulders  Top  will
be described for illustration): (1) a rally which ends a more or less extensive
advance on heavy volume, and which is then followed by a Minor Reaction
on  less  volume;  this  is  the  left  shoulder;  (2)  another  high-volume  advance
which exceeds the high of the left shoulder, followed by another low-volume
reaction which takes prices down to near the bottom of the preceding reac-
tion, and below the top of the left shoulder high; this is the head; (3) a third
rally, but on decidedly less volume than accompanied either of the ﬁrst two
advances, and which fails to exceed the high established on the head; this
is  the  right  shoulder;  and  (4)  a  decline  through  a  line  drawn  across  the
proceeding  two  reaction  lows  (the  neckline),  and  a  close  below  that  line
equivalent to 3% of the stock’s market price. This is the conﬁrmation of the
breakout.  A  Head-and-Shoulders  Bottom,  or  any  other  combination
Headand-Shoulders  Pattern,  contains  the  same  four  elements.  The  main
difference between a Top Formation and a Bottom Formation is in the volume
patterns.  The  breakout  in  a  Top  can  be  on  low  volume.  The  breakout  in  a
Bottom must show a “conspicuous burst of activity.” Minimum Measuring
Formula:  add  the  distance  between  the  head  and  neckline  to  the  breakout
point.

HEAD-AND-SHOULDERS  BOTTOM  —  Area  Pattern  which  reverses  a

HEAD-AND-SHOULDERS TOP — Area Pattern which reverses an advance.
(See also Head-and-Shoulders Pattern.)

HEAVY VOLUME — The expression “heavy volume,” as used by Edwards
and Magee, means heavy only with respect to the recent volume of sales in
the stock you are watching.

HEDGING — To try to lessen risk by making a counterbalancing investment.
In a stock portfolio, an example of a hedge would be to buy 100 shares of
XYZ stock, and to buy one put option of the same stock. The put would help
protect against a decline in the stock, but it would also limit potential gains
on the upside. See Natural Hedge.

HISTORICAL DATA — A series of past daily, weekly, or monthly market prices.

HOOK DAY — A trading day in which the open is above/below prior day’s
high/low and the close is below/above prior day’s close with narrow range.

HORIZONTAL CHANNEL — When the Tops of the rallies and Bottoms of
the  reactions  form  along  lines  which  are  horizontal  and  parallel  to  one
another,  the  area  in  between  is  called  a  Horizontal  Trend  Channel.  It  may
also be called a Rectangle during the early stages of formation.

HORIZONTAL  TRENDLINE  — A  horizontal  line  drawn  across  either  the
Tops or Bottoms in a sideways trending market.

HYBRID  HEAD-AND-SHOULDERS  —  A  small  Head-and-Shoulders  Pat-
tern within a larger Head-and-Shoulders Pattern. (See also Head-and-Shoul-
ders Pattern.)

INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE — See Dow–Jones Industrial Average.

INSIDE  DAY  — A  day  in  which  the  daily  price  range  is  totally  within  the
prior day’s daily price range.

INSIDERS  —  Individuals  who  possess  fundamental  information  likely  to
affect the price of a stock, but which is unavailable to the public. An example
would be an individual who knows about a merger before it is announced
to the public. Trading by insiders on this type of information is illegal.

IPO — Initial Public Offering. 

INTERMEDIATE TREND — In Edwards and Magee, the term Intermediate
or  Secondary  refers  to  a  trend  (or  pattern  indicating  a  trend)  against  the
Primary (Major) Trend which is likely to last from 3 weeks to 3 months, and
which may retrace one third to two thirds of the previous Primary Advance
or Decline.

INVERTED BOWL — See Rounding Top.

INVERTED TRIANGLE — See Right-Angled Broadening Triangle.

ISLAND  REVERSAL  —  A  compact  trading  range,  usually  formed  after  a
fast  rally  or  reaction,  which  is  separated  from  the  previous  move  by  an
Exhaustion Gap, and from the move in the opposite direction which follows
by  a  Breakaway  Gap.  The  result  is  an  Island  of  prices  detached  by  a  gap
before  and  after.  If  the  trading  range  contains  only  one  day,  it  is  called  a
One-Day Island Reversal. The two gaps usually occur at approximately the
same  level.  By  itself,  the  pattern  is  not  of  major  signiﬁcance;  but  it  does

frequently send prices back for a complete retracement of the Minor Move
which preceded it.

KILROY BOTTOM — The Editor’s contribution to the nomenclature. A more
descriptive term for the undescriptive “Head-and-Shoulders Bottom”.

LADDERING — A practice some Wall Street underwriters used in the tuli-
pomania  of  the  1990s.  Consists  of  selling  IPO  shares  for  the  pre-opening
price to insider customers in exchange for their agreement to buy more in
the public offering at higher prices. Caused extreme volatility and big run
ups in early days of IPOs. An unethical form of price manipulation.

LEVERAGE — Using a smaller amount of capital to control an investment
of greater value. For example, exclusive of interest and commission costs, if
you buy a stock on 50% margin, you control $1 of stock for every 50 cents
invested or leverage of 2-to-1.

LIMIT  MOVE  —  A  change  in  price  which  exceeds  the  limits  set  by  the
exchange on which the futures contract is traded.

LIMIT ORDER — A buy or sell order which is limited in some way, usually
in  price.  For  example,  if  you  placed  a  limit  order  to  buy  IBM  at  100,  the
broker would not ﬁll the order unless he could do so at your price or better,
i.e., at 100 or lower.

LIMIT UP, LIMIT DOWN — Commodity exchange restrictions on the max-
imum upward or downward movements permitted in the price for a com-
modity during any trading session day.

LINE,  DOW  THEORY  —  A  Line  in  the  Dow  Theory  is  an  Intermediate
Sideways  Movement  in  one  or  both  of  the  Averages  (Industrial  and/or
Transportation)in the course of which prices ﬂuctuate within a range of 5%
(of mean price) or less.

LOGARITHMIC SCALE — See Semilogarithmic Scale.

MAJOR  TREND  —  In  Edwards  and  Magee,  the  term  Major  (or  Primary)
refers to a trend (or pattern leading to such a trend) which lasts at least one
year, and shows a rise or decline of at least 20%.

MARGIN — The minimum amount of capital required to buy or sell a stock.
The  rate,  50%  of  value  in  2005,  is  set  by  the  government.  In  a  commodity,
margin  is  also  the  minimum,  usually  about  10%,  needed  to  buy  or  sell  a
contract.  But  the  rate  is  set  by  the  individual  exchanges.  The  two  differ  in
cost as well. In a stock, the broker lends the investor the balance of the money
due and charges interest for the loan. In a commodity, margin is treated as
a good faith payment. The broker does not lend the difference, so no interest
expense is incurred.

MARKET  ON  CLOSE  — An  order  speciﬁcation  which  requires  the  broker
to get the best price available on the close of trading.

MARKET  ORDER  —  An  instruction  to  buy  or  sell  at  the  price  prevailing
when the order reaches the ﬂoor of the exchange.

MARKET RECIPROCAL — Normal average range of a stock based on the
average range for a number of years, divided by the current average range.
The  result  is  the  reciprocal  of  the  market  movement  for  the  period.  Wide
market activity, for example, would show a small decimal, less than 1. Dull
trading would be a larger number.

MAST — The vertical rally or reaction preceding a Flag or Pennant Formation.

McCLELLAN  OSCILLATOR  —  An  Index  based  on  New  York  Stock
Exchange net advances over declines. It provides a measure of such condi-
tions as overbought/oversold and market direction on a short- to interme-
diate-term  basis.  The  McClellan  Oscillator  measures  a  Bear  Market  Selling
Climax when registering a very negative reading like –150. A sharp buying
pulse in the market is indicated by a very positive reading, well above 100.

MEASURING FORMULAE — There are certain patterns which do allow the
chartist  the  opportunity  to  project  at  least  an  interim  target  level  of  the
direction  of  the  Primary  Trend.  The  most  important  of  these  patterns  are
found to be Triangles, Rectangles, Head-and-Shoulders, Pennants and Flags.

Triangles — When a stock breaks out of a Symmetrical Triangle (either
up  or  down),  the  ensuing  move  should  carry  at  least  as  far  as  the
height of the Triangle as measured along its ﬁrst reaction.

Rectangles — The minimum you would expect from a breakout (up or
down) out of a Rectangle Pattern would be the distance equal to the
height of the formation.

Head-and-Shoulders Tops/Bottoms — The Head-and-Shoulders Pattern
has one of the better measuring sticks. In either a Top or Bottom, the
interim target, once the neckline is penetrated, is the distance from
the Top (or Bottom) of the head to the level of the neckline directly
below (above) the head.

Pennants and Flags — The one thing to remember about these Contin-
uation Patterns is that they “ﬂy at half-mast.” In other words, the leg
in equals the leg out.

MEASURING GAP — See Runaway Gap.

MEGAPHONES — Megaphones are Broadening Tops. The Broadening For-
mation may evolve in any one of the three forms comparable, respectively,
to Inverted Symmetrical, Inverted Ascending, or Descending Triangles. The
symmetrical type, for example, consists of a series of price ﬂuctuations across
a horizontal axis, with each Minor Top higher and each Minor Bottom lower
than  its  predecessor.  The  pattern  may  thus  be  roughly  marked  off  by  two
diverging  lines,  the  upper  sloping  up  from  left  to  right,  the  lower  sloping
down. These Broadening Patterns are characteristically loose and irregular,

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

whereas  Symmetrical  Triangles  are  regular  and  compact.  The  converging
boundary lines of Symmetrical Triangles are clearly deﬁned, as a rule. Tops
and Bottoms within the formation tend to fall within fair precision on these
boundary lines. In the Broadening Formation, the rallies and declines usually
do not all stop at clearly marked boundary lines and are subject to spikes.
We  could  call  this  a  Megaphone  Spike  because  the  formation  keeps  on
crowding at the lines to look like a megaphone. It has a tendency to spike
down more than up.

MINOR TREND — In Edwards and Magee, the term Minor refers to brief
ﬂuctuations (usually less than 6 days and rarely longer than 3 weeks) which,
in total, make up the Intermediate Trend.

MOMENTUM  INDICATOR  —  A  market  indicator  which  utilizes  volume
statistics  for  predicting  the  strength  or  weakness  of  a  current  market  and
any  overbought  or  oversold  conditions,  and  to  distinguish  turning  points
within the market.

MOVING  AVERAGE  —  A  mathematical  technique  to  smooth  data.  It  is
called moving because the number of elements are ﬁxed, but the time interval
advances. Old data must be removed when new data is added, which causes
the average to “move along” with the progression of the stock or commodity.
EN: Simple moving average for n days consists of summing prices for n days and
dividing by n. On n+1, drop the ﬁrst day and add the new day to the formula, etc.

MOVING AVERAGE CONVERGENCE/DIVERGENCE (MACD) — MACD,
an oscillator derived by dividing one Moving Average by another. Basically,
it  combines  three  Moving  Averages  into  two  lines.  In  today’s  computer
programs,  the  Moving  Averages  are  usually  exponentially  weighted,  thus
giving  more  weight  to  the  more  recent  data.  It  is  plotted  in  a  chart  with  a
horizontal Equilibrium Line.

The Equilibrium Line is important. When the two Moving Averages cross
below the Equilibrium Line, it means that the shorter EMA is at a value less
than  the  longer  EMA.  This  is  a  Bearish  signal.  When  the  EMAs  are  above
the Equilibrium Line, it means that the shorter EMA has a value greater than
the longer EMA. This is a Bullish signal.

The ﬁrst line is the difference between a 12-period Exponential Moving
Average  and  a  26-period  Exponential  Moving  Average.  The  second  line
(signal line) is an approximate exponential equivalent of a 9-period Moving
Average of the ﬁrst line. The exponential values being 0.15, 0.075, and 0.20.
An MACD can be displayed as a line oscillator or a histogram.

Buy signals are generated when the faster Moving Average Line crosses
the  slower  Moving  Average  Line  from  below.  Sell  signals  come  from  the
opposite, when the faster line crosses the slower line from above. Beware of
mechanically trading every MACD crossover; it can lead to whipsaws and
drawdowns  with  substance.  The  fact  is,  narrow  trading  ranges  give  many
false signals which can be avoided with additional interpretation. (See also
Appendix C.)

MOVING AVERAGE CROSSOVERS — The point where the various Moving
Average Lines pass through or over each other.

MULTICOLINCARITY — The incorrect procedure of using the identical data
to supply different types of indicators. The indicators will all conﬁrm each
other since they are based on the same data. Combining RSI, Moving Average
Convergence/Divergence (MACD), and rate of change (where all indicators
use  the  same  closing  prices  and  relative  time  periods)  should  provide  the
same  signals,  but  they  could  easily  be  incorrect.  Multicolincarity  can  be
avoided  by  using  one  indicator  based  on  closing  prices,  another  from  vol-
ume,  and  a  third  from  price  ranges.  It  can  also  be  avoided  by  using  data
generated indicators compared to chart patterns. (See also Bollinger Bands,
MACD, Wilder RSI.)

which  looks  directly  at  market  data,  as  opposed  to  “unnatural  methods”
which place an algorithm between the data and the analysis, such as moving
averages, oscillators, etc.

NATURAL HEDGE — Bassetti’s formulation of a technique recommended
by Magee whereby a portfolio is always somewhat long and somewhat short.
It is an imperfect hedge intended to cushion downside (or upside) risks. E.g.,
long the DIA and short its members (or their proxies) which are in downtrends.

NECKLINE — In a Head-and-Shoulders Pattern, it is the line drawn across
the  two  reaction  lows  (in  a  Top),  or  two  rally  highs  (in  a  Bottom),  which
occur before and after the head. This line must be broken by 3% to conﬁrm
the Reversal. In a Diamond Pattern, which is similar to a Head-and-Shoul-
ders Pattern, the neckline is bent in the shape of a V or inverted V. (See also
Diamond and Head-and-Shoulders.)

in the volume for that day getting a positive value, while a lower close results
in  a  negative  value. A  running  total  is  kept  by  adding  or  subtracting  each
day’s volume based on the direction of the close. The direction of the OBV
line is watched, not the actual volume numbers.

Formula:

• If Today’s Close > Yesterday’s Close, 

then OBV = Yesterday’s OBV + Today’s Volume

• If Today’s Close < Yesterday’s Close, 

then OBV = Yesterday’s OBV – Today’s Volume

POINT & FIGURE CHART — A method of charting believed to have been
created by Charles Dow. Each day the price moves by a speciﬁc amount (the
arbitrary box size), an X (if up) or O (if down) is placed on a vertical column
of squared paper. As long as prices do not change direction by a speciﬁed
amount  (the  Reversal),  the  trend  is  considered  to  be  in  force  and  no  new
column is made. If a Reversal takes place, another vertical column is started
immediately to the right of the ﬁrst, but in the opposite direction. There is
no provision for time on a Point & Figure Chart.

PREMATURE BREAKOUT — A breakout of an Area Pattern, then a retreat
back into the pattern. Eventually, the trend will break out again and proceed
in the same direction. At the time they occur, false breakouts and premature
breakouts are indistinguishable from each other, or a genuine breakout.

RECTANGLE — A trading area which is bounded on the Top and the Bottom
with horizontal, or near horizontal, lines. A Rectangle can be either a Reversal
or Continuation Pattern depending on the direction of the breakout. Mini-

tom) of the Rectangle to the breakout point.

RED  PARALLEL  — A  line  drawn  parallel  to  the  trendline  (Red  Trendline)
which  connects  at  least  two  Bottoms.  The  Red  Parallel  (basically  a  Return
Line) is started off a high and used to estimate the next high point.

RED  TRENDLINE  —  A  straight  line  connecting  two  or  more  Bottoms
together. To avoid confusion, Edwards and Magee use a red line for Bottom
Trendlines and a blue line for Top Trendlines.

RELATIVE STRENGTH (RS or RS INDEX) — A stock’s price movement over
the  past  year  as  compared  to  a  market  index  (most  often  the  Standard  &
Poor’s 500 Index). Value below 1 means the stock shows relative weakness
in price movement (underperformed the market); a value above 1 means the
stock shows relative strength over the 1-year period.

Equation for Relative Strength:

RESISTANCE LEVEL — A price level at which a sufﬁcient supply of stock
is forthcoming to stop, and possibly turn back for a time, an uptrend.

RETRACEMENT  —  A  price  movement  in  the  opposite  direction  of  the
previous trend.

RETURN LINE — See Ascending or Descending Trend Channels.

REVERSAL GAP — A chart formation where the low of the last day is above
the previous day’s range, with the close above midrange and above the open.

REVERSAL  PATTERN  — An Area  Pattern  which  breaks  out  in  a  direction
opposite  to  the  previous  trend.  (See  also  Ascending  Triangle,  Broadening
Formation, Broadening Top, Descending Triangle, Diamond, Dormant Bot-
tom,  Double  Bottom  or  Top,  Triple  Bottom  or  Top,  Head-and-Shoulders,
Rectangle, Rounding Bottom or Top, Saucer, Symmetrical Triangle, and Ris-
ing or Falling Wedge.)

RIGHT-ANGLED  BROADENING  TRIANGLE  —  Area  Pattern  with  one
boundary line horizontal and the other at an angle which, when extended,
will converge with the horizontal line at some point to the left of the pattern.
Similar  in  shape  to  Ascending  and  Descending  Triangles,  except  they  are
inverted and look like Flat-Topped or Bottomed Megaphones. Right-Angled
Broadening  Formations  generally  carry  Bearish  implications  regardless  of

which  side  is  ﬂat.  But  any  decisive  breakout  (3%  or  more)  through  the
horizontal boundary line has the same forceful signiﬁcance as does a brea-
kout in an Ascending or Descending Triangle.

RIGHT-ANGLE TRIANGLES — See Ascending and Descending Triangles.

RISING WEDGE — An Area Pattern with two upward-slanting, converging
trendlines. Normally, it takes more than 3 weeks to complete, and volume
will diminish as prices move toward the apex of the pattern. The anticipated
direction of the breakout in a Rising Wedge is down. Minimum Measuring
Formula: a retracement of all the ground gained within the wedge.

ROUND LOT — A block of stock consisting of 100 shares of stock.

ROUND TRIP — The cost of one complete stock or commodity transaction,
i.e., the entry cost and the offset cost combined.

ROUNDING  BOTTOM  — An Area  Pattern  which  pictures  a  gradual,  pro-
gressive, and fairly symmetrical change in the trend from down to up. Both
the  Price  Pattern  (along  its  lows)  and  the  Volume  Pattern  show  a  concave
shape  often  called  a  Bowl  or  Saucer.  There  is  no  minimum  measuring  for-
mula associated with this Reversal Pattern.

ROUNDING TOP — An Area Pattern which pictures a gradual, progressive,
and  fairly  symmetrical  change  in  the  trend  from  up  to  down.  The  Price
Pattern, along its highs, shows a convex shape sometimes called an Inverted
Bowl.  The  Volume  Pattern  is  concave  shaped  (a  bowl)  as  trading  activity
declines into the peak of the Price Pattern, and increases when prices begin
to fall. There is no measuring formula associated with this Reversal Pattern.

RUNAWAY  GAP  —  A  relatively  wide  gap  in  prices  which  occurs  in  an
advance or decline gathering momentum. Also called a “Measuring Gap,”
since it frequently occurs at just about the halfway point between the brea-
kout which started the move and the Reversal Day which calls an end to it.
Minimum Measuring Formula: take the distance from the original breakout
point to the start of the gap, and add it to the other side of the gap.

RUNNING MARKET — A market wherein prices are moving rapidly in one
direction with very few or no price changes in the opposite direction.

SAUCER — See Rounding Bottom and Scallop.

SCALLOPS  —  A  series  of  Rounding  Bottom  (Saucer)  Patterns  where  the
rising end always carries prices a little higher than the preceding Top at the
beginning of the pattern. Net gains will vary from stock to stock, but there
is a strong tendency for it to amount to 10–15% of the price. The total reaction,
from the left-hand Top of each Saucer to its Bottom, is usually in the 20–30%
area. Individual Saucers in a Scallop series are normally 5 to 7 weeks long,
and rarely less than 3 weeks. The volume will show a convex or Bowl Pattern.

SECONDARY TREND — See Intermediate Trend.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

SELLING CLIMAX — A period of extraordinary volume which comes at the
end of a rapid and comprehensive decline which exhausts the margin reserves
of many speculators or patience of investors. Total volume turnover may exceed
any single day’s volume during the previous upswing as Panic Selling sweeps
through the stock or commodity. Also called a Clean-Out Day, a Selling Climax
reverses  the  technical  conditions  of  the  market.  Although  it  is  a  form  of  a
One-Day Reversal, it can take more than one day to complete.

SEMILOGARITHMIC SCALE — Price or volume scale where the distance
on  the  vertical  axis  (i.e.,  space  between  horizontal  lines)  represents  equal
percentage changes.

SENSITIVITY  —  An  index  used  by  Edwards  and  Magee  to  measure  the
probable  percentage  movement  (sensitivity)  of  a  stock  during  a  speciﬁed
EN: More or less equivalent,
percentage move in the stock market as a whole. 
or with the same intent as beta.

SHAKEOUT  —  A  corrective  move  large  enough  to  “shake  out”  nervous
investors before the Primary Trend resumes.

SHORT INTEREST — The number of shares that have been sold short and
not yet repurchased. This information is published monthly by the New York
Stock Exchange.

SHORT SALE — A transaction where the entry position is to sell a stock or
commodity ﬁrst and to repurchase it (hopefully at a lower price) at a later
date. In the stock market, shares you do not own can be sold by borrowing
shares from the broker, and replacing them when the offsetting repurchase
takes  place.  In  the  commodity  market,  contracts  are  created  when  a  buyer
and seller get together through a ﬂoor broker. As a result, the procedure to
sell in the commodity market is the same as it is to buy.

SHOULDER — See Head-and-Shoulders Patterns.

SMOOTHING — A mathematical approach that removes excess data vari-
ability while maintaining a correct appraisal of the underlying trend.

SPIKE — A sharp rise in price in a single day or two.

STOCHASTIC — Literally means random.

STOCHASTICS  —  The  Stochastic  Oscillator,  developed  by  George  Lane,
compares  a  security’s  price  closing  level  to  its  price  range  over  a  speciﬁc
period  of  time.  This  indicator  shows,  Lane  theorized,  that  in  an  upwardly
trending market, prices tend to close near their high; and during a downward
trending  market,  prices  tend  to  close  near  their  low.  As  an  upward  trend
matures, prices tend to close further away from their high; as a downward
trend  matures,  prices  tend  to  close  away  from  their  low.  The  Stochastic
Indicator  attempts  to  determine  when  prices  start  to  cluster  around  their
low of the day in an uptrending market, and cluster around their high in a
downtrend.  Lane  theorizes  these  conditions  indicate  a  Trend  Reversal  is

beginning to occur. The Stochastic Indicator is plotted as two lines, the %D
Line and %K Line. The %D Line is more important than the %K Line. The
Stochastic is plotted on a chart with values ranging from 0 to 100. The value
can never fall below 0 or above 100. Readings above 80 are considered strong
and  indicate  a  price  is  closing  near  its  high.  Readings  below  20  are  strong
and  indicate  a  price  is  closing  near  its  low.  Ordinarily,  the  %K  Line  will
change direction before the %D Line. However, when the %D Line changes
direction prior to the %K Line, a slow and steady Reversal is often indicated.
When  both  %K  and  %D  Lines  change  direction,  and  the  faster  %K  Line
changes direction to retest a crossing of the %D Line, though doesn’t cross
it, the incident conﬁrms stability of the prior Reversal. A powerful move is
under way when the Indicator reaches its extremes around 0 and 100. Fol-
lowing  a  Pullback  in  price,  if  the  Indicator  retests  extremes,  a  good  entry
point is indicated. Many times, when the %K or %D Lines begin to ﬂatten
out, the action becomes an indication the trend will reverse during the next
trading range. (See also Appendix C.)

STOCK SPLIT — A procedure used by management to establish a different
market price for its shares by changing the common stock structure of the
company. Usually a lower price is desired, and established by canceling the
outstanding  shares  and  reissuing  a  larger  number  of  new  certiﬁcates  to
current shareholders. The most common ratios are 2-to-1, 3-to-1, and 3-to-2.
Occasionally, a higher price is desired and a reverse split takes place where
one new share is issued for some multiple number of old shares.

STOP — A contingency order which is placed above the current market price
if it is to buy, or below the current market price if it is to sell. A stop order
becomes a market order only when the stock or commodity moves up to the
price of the buy stop, or down to the price of a sell stop. A stop can be used
to enter a new position or exit an old position. (See also Protective or Pro-
gressive Stop.)

STOP LOSS — See Protective Stop.

SUPPLY — Amount of stock available at a given price.

SUPPLY LINE — See Resistance.

SUPPORT LEVEL — The price level at which a sufﬁcient amount of demand
is forthcoming to stop, and possibly turn higher for a time, a downtrend.

SYMMETRICAL  TRIANGLE  —  Also  called  a  Coil.  Can  be  a  Reversal  or
Continuation Pattern. A sideways congestion where each Minor Top fails to
attain the height of the previous rally and each Minor Bottom stops above
the  level  of  the  previous  low.  The  result  is  upper  and  lower  boundary  lines
which converge, if extended, to a point on the right. The upper boundary line
must slant down and the lower boundary line must slant up, or it would be a
variety  of  a  Wedge.  Volume  tends  to  diminish  during  formation.  Minimum
Formula: add the widest distance within the Triangle to its breakout point.

TANGENT — See Trendline.

TAPE READER — One who makes trading decisions by watching the ﬂow
of New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange price and vol-
ume data coming across the electronic ticker tape.

TEKNIPLAT  PAPER  —  A  specially  formatted,  two-cycle,  semilogarithmic
graph paper, with sixth-line vertical accents, used to chart stock or commod-
ity prices. Check the web site: www.edwards-magee.com.

TEST — A term used to describe the activity of a stock or commodity when
it  returns  to,  or  “tests,”  the  validity  of  a  previous  trendline,  or  Support  or
Resistance Level.

THIN ISSUE — A stock which has a low number of ﬂoating shares and is
lightly traded.

THREE-DAY-AWAY  RULE  —  An  arbitrary  time  period  used  by  Edwards
and Magee in marking suspected Minor Tops or Bottoms.

THROWBACK — Return of prices to the boundary line of the pattern after
a  breakout  to  the  upside.  Return  after  a  downside  breakout  is  called  a
Pullback.

TOP  —  See  Broadening  Top,  Descending  Triangle,  Double  Top,
Head-and-Shoulders Top, Triple Top, and Rounding Top.

TREND  —  The  movement  of  prices  in  the  same  general  direction,  or  the
tendency  or  proclivity  to  move  in  a  straight  line.  (See  also  Ascending,
Descending,  and  Horizontal  Parallel  Trend  Channels,  Convergent  Trend,
Divergent Trend, Intermediate Trend, Major Trend, and Minor Trend.)

TREND  CHANNEL  — A  parallel  probable  price  range  centered  about  the
most likely price line.

TRENDING  MARKET  —  Price  continues  to  move  in  a  single  direction,
usually closing strongly for the day.

TRENDLINE  —  If  we  actually  apply  a  ruler  to  a  number  of  charted  price
trends, we quickly discover the line that most often is really straight in an
uptrend  is  a  line  connecting  the  lower  extremes  of  the  Minor  Recessions
within these lines. In other words, an advancing wave in the stock market
is composed of a series of ripples, and the bottoms of each of these ripples
tend to form on, or very close to, an upward slanting straight line. The tops
of the ripples are usually less even; sometimes they also can be deﬁned by
a straight line, but more often, they vary slightly in amplitude, and so any
line  connecting  their  upper  tips  would  be  more  or  less  crooked.  On  a
descending  price  trend,  the  line  most  likely  to  be  straight  is  the  one  that
connects  the  tops  of  the  Minor  Rallies  within  it,  while  the  Minor  Bottoms
may or may not fall along a straight edge. These two lines — the one that
slants up along the successive wave bottoms within a broad up-move and

the one that slants down across successive wave tops within a broad down
move — are the Basic Trendlines. You draw an Up Trendline by drawing the
line  on  the  inner  side.  You  draw  a  Down  Trendline  by  drawing  it  on  the
outside. You draw a Sideways Trendline on the bottom.

TRIANGLE — See Ascending Triangle, Descending Triangle, Right-Angled
Broadening Triangle, and Symmetrical Triangle.

TRIPLE BOTTOM — Similar to a ﬂat Head-and-Shoulders Bottom, or Rect-
angle, the three Bottoms in a Triple Bottom.

TRIPLE TOP — An Area Pattern with three Tops which are widely spaced
and  with  quite  deep,  and  usually  rounding,  reactions  between  them.  Less
volume occurs on the second peak than the ﬁrst peak, and still less on the
third peak. Sometimes called a “W” Pattern, particularly if the second peak
is  below  the  ﬁrst  and  third.  The  Triple  Top  is  conﬁrmed  when  the  decline
from the third Top penetrates the Bottom of the lowest valley between the
three peaks.

200-DAY MOVING AVERAGE LINE — Is determined by taking the closing
price over the past 200 trading days and dividing by 200, then repeating the
process each succeeding day, always dropping off the earliest day.

UPTICK — A securities transaction which is made at a price higher than the
preceding transaction.

UPTREND — See Ascending Trendline and Trend.

UTILITY AVERAGE — See Dow–Jones Utility Average.

V/D  VOLUME  —  Is  the  ratio  between  the  daily  up-volume  to  the  daily
downvolume. It is a 50-day ratio which is determined by dividing the total
volume on those days when the stock closed up from the prior day by the
total volume on days when the stock closed down.

VALIDITY OF TRENDLINE PENETRATION — The application of the fol-
lowing three tests when a trendline is broken to determine whether the break
is valid, or whether the trendline is still basically intact: (1) the extent of the
penetration, (2) the volume of trading on the penetration, and (3) the trading
action after the penetration.

VALLEY  —  The  V-shaped  price  action  which  occurs  between  two  peaks.
(See also Double Top and Triple Top.)

VOLATILITY — A measure of a stock’s tendency to move up and down in
EN:
price, based on its daily price history over the latest 12-month period. 
See formula in Resources.

VOLUME  —  The  number  of  shares  in  stocks  or  contracts  in  commodities
which are traded over a speciﬁed period of time.

“W” FORMATION — See Triple Top.

Technical Analysis of Stock Trends

WEDGE  — A  chart  formation  in  which  the  price  ﬂuctuations  are  conﬁned
within converging straight (or practically straight) lines.

WILDER  RELATIVE  STRENGTH  INDICATOR  (RSI)  —  Although  relative
strength, comparing a security price to a benchmark index price, has been
around for some time, this indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder, as
explained in his 1978 book, 

New Concepts in Technical Trading
.

Relative  Strength  is  often  used  to  identify  price  Tops  and  Bottoms  by
keying on speciﬁc levels (usually “30” and “70”) on the RSI chart, which is
scaled from 0-100. The RSI can also be useful to show:

1. Movement which might not be as readily apparent on the bar chart.
2. Failure Swings above 70 or below 30, warning of coming Reversals.
3. Support and Resistance Levels appear with greater clarity.
4. Divergence between the RSI and price can often be a useful Reversal

indicator.

The  Relative  Strength  Index  requires  a  certain  amount  of  lead-up  time  in
order to operate successfully.
