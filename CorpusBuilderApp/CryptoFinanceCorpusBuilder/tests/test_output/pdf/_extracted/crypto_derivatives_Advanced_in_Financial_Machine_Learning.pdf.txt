Advances in Financial Machine Learning, by Marcos
Lopez de Prado, Wiley (2018). Hardback. ISBN 978-

Marcos Lopez de Prado deﬁnes his book as ‘a research man-
ual for teams, not for individuals’. Hopefully, not only quant
specialists of investment and trading companies will read
the book, but also their senior managers will adapt its main
ﬁndings. Already in the ﬁrst chapter—the ‘preamble’—de
Prado lays the cornerstones of a successful structure of a
quant research setup and outlines the most common manage-
ment mistakes of implementing machine learning across the
investment process.
In his line of thoughts, the most notorious management mis-
take is to treat quant specialists like discretionary managers.
Unlike discretionary managers, who are usually kept in com-
peting silos in order not to dilute their speciﬁc edge, quants
should specialise at a certain task of the whole value chain
and validate and support each other to enable a professional
production line. The reason for this different approach is the
increasing complexity of the various steps due to the trend to
include more complex data. In a market of decreasing alpha,
this is a competitive advantage.
The suggested ‘production chain’ of quantitative strategies
consists of data curators, feature analysts, strategists, back-
testing specialists, a deployment team and a separate portfolio
oversight responsibility. Notably, colleagues from sales and
marketing are not part of this production chain, although they
will be responsible for raising assets for the client product.
This process setup contrasts the current trend in ﬁnancial
ﬁrms of moving from investment-centric to client-centric
businesses.
De Prado has a strong view on the use of backtests in the
ﬁnancial industry. He points out that each tested strategy vari-
ation is a hypothesis, and that a not strictly planned loop of
sequential testing and ‘improving’ a strategy leads to a sig-
niﬁcant overﬁtting bias that will likely render the result as
worthless. The more careful and diligent the strategy devel-
opment process is, the more realistic (read: lower) the shown
expected value of its performance will be. Therefore, under

severe time and performance pressure, even a very highly
qualiﬁed, but isolated PhD will likely fail to develop a suc-
cessful quant-driven investment process. This ﬂawed R&D
process concerns colleagues working in the ﬁnancial industry
as well as in academia.
Machine learning is not simply a more casual alternative to
econometrics without proper hypotheses testing but can help
to professionalise the production chain. The author presents
concrete tools and algorithms that make it possible to improve
the structure and labelling of data, to ﬁnd meaningful features,
to generate synthetic data for additional out-of-sample test-
ing,to overcome unstable covariance matrices, and to quantify
the damned overﬁtting bias. To do so, de Prado relies not only
on own well-known scientiﬁc contributions like hierarchical
risk parity (HRP) and the ‘probability of backtest overﬁtting’,
but refers to a full selection of the most important literature of
this ﬁeld at the end of each chapter and even points to speciﬁc
helpful Python libraries.
The book offers a rigorous mathematical presentation and
compact code snippets that proﬁt from the rigorous mathemat-
ical education and in-depth quantitative ﬁnance experience
of the reader. In other words: this is not an introductory
book.† For readers with the necessary background, it delivers

academia and the industry’ written on the ﬂap. We are glad to
have already spotted several third-party Github repositories
and blogs that explore, explain and apply the rich material
of this book. If used as intended—as a workbook for teams,
and then communicated to senior management—it can have
a substantial impact on the seriousness of investment prod-
uct development, and on investors’ conﬁdence in the resulting
products.
