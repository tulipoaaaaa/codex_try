Mean reversion - A new approach

Tarek Nassar, Sandro Ephrem

August 27, 2020

Introduction

Mean reversion is an all-time favourite of quantitative traders and has been used in trading
strategies for the equities, ﬁxed income, FX and commodities markets. The basic idea is perhaps
best expressed by examining stock prices. Stock markets follow a "staircase" like curve that looks
like the superposition of a piecewise continuous curve and an oscillatory, quasi-periodic process
where the price evolution looks like a “rugged” staircase which sometimes goes up and sometimes
goes down as illustrated by the ﬁgure 1 below for the Nasdaq index:

Figure 1: Nasdaq historical prices

In ﬁgure 1 above, the "staircase" we are referring to is shown by the straight lines in diﬀerent
colors. Overall the “staircase” points up and this is natural due to inﬂation and natural growth. If
we subtract the “staircase” from the Nasdaq in the graph above we get the following graph:

Figure 2: Nasdaq de-trended

We note that this second graph looks somewhat chaotic except for an interesting feature:
it
looks almost periodic. This almost-periodicity is called “mean reversion” and is typically modeled
via the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, who ﬁrst developed the model in physics to account for the
motion of a Brownian particle under the eﬀect of friction.

Why do we see this kind of behaviour? There are a thousand theories and although we do not
propose to go through these in any detail, a cursory look is instructive. Trends (as illustrated by
ﬁgure 1) usually occur because of:

• Macro changes across the entire economy, such as the one the world is currently undergoing

with the COVID-19 pandemic

• Changes in the speciﬁc industry of the company’s whose stock is being traded (e.g.

the

introduction of 3G licences in the early 2000’s)

• Herd behaviour (almost any ﬁnancial crisis in the past 50 years would be a ﬁtting example)

• Exogenous factors such as political turmoil (9/11 terror attacks) or natural events (2004

tsunami)

• Corporate events (earnings forecasts, mergers and acquisitions, share buybacks etc.)

• Substantive changes in monetary or ﬁscal policy by central banks

The list is not exhaustive but it showcases some of the potential explanatory factors for the be-
haviour of stock prices. With the exception of herd behaviour, all of the above factors are discrete
in nature: we do not have new and impactful news on the economy or on speciﬁc companies or
industrial sectors every day and, mercifully, we do not have major wars or climatic calamities every
other month!

But prices change neverthless: this is reﬂected by the mean reversion seen in ﬁgure 2. Why does
it happen? The reason may be deceptively simple: few market agents have long trading horizons
and as such, tend to take proﬁt or stop loss on their positions within a short time period. Since most
traders have access to substantially similar information, if it so happens that the market is in an
uneventful period, there will be as many buyers as sellers. Putting this together gives a behaviour
that closely mimics the mean reversion we observe in the market.

During this quasi-periodic part, statistical arbitrage takes place. This basically exploits price mean
reversion: when the price is considerably above its expected mean, one sells in the expectation that
this price will drop and vice-versa. But the devil is in the detail, namely, where is the mean and
when exactly are we “considerably above (or below) the mean”?

Statistical arbitrage is old and widely practised but it is far from being completely understood
or mastered. The literature on mean reversion is vast. In references [2, 6, 8, 18], the basics of mean
reversion and its applications in various markets are discussed. Extensions to the basic aﬃne frame-
work are discussed in [5,12] where solvable mean reverting models with nonlinear drift are presented
while in [14] the nonlinearity is in the diﬀusion (Brownian motion) term. More recently with the
advent of real life use cases of artiﬁcial intelligence, the use of neural networks in trading has also
become extensive: in [3], reinforcement learning methods are applied to pairs trading strategies, the
precursors of most statistical arbitrage trades. In [15], neural networks are used to optimise trading
strategies when the underlying return dynamics are given by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process while
in [16], the impact of transaction costs is explicitly taken into account. In [1], statistical arbitrage
based on mean reversion for the US equity markets using PCA factors and sector ETFs is discussed.

In this paper we start by recalling recent approaches to statistical arbitrage and mean reversion
and then proceed to present a new approach that combines model-independence (through the use
of neural networks) with information theory.

2 Mean reversion - the basics

Typically, practitioners approach mean reversion by modeling stock returns using an Ornstein-
Uhlenbeck model (known in the ﬁxed income world as the Vasicek model) or variants thereoﬀ. For
instance if we denote by P (i)

the price of the ith security, a mean reversion model would be:

t

t+1 − x(i)
x(i)

t = κ(i) (cid:16)

µ(i) − x(i)
t

(cid:17)

+ σi(cid:15)(i)
t+1

where the beta hedged portfolio is deﬁned as:

t = P (i)
x(i)

t −

ΛiαF (α)

t − ηi

(cid:88)

α

(1)

(2)

The factors F (α)

t

are usually taken to represent market beta, e.g.

the returns on sector ETFs so
that equation (1) can be viewed as the cumulative eﬀect of a market wide trend and a stock-speciﬁc
(idiosyncratic) component. The inclusion of these factors is essential since otherwise, the trends
typically seen over sustained periods cannot be captured. The process in (2) is mean reverting and
allows us to calculate the idiosyncratic return:
t+1 = κ(i) (cid:16)
R(i)

µ(i) − x(i)
t

+ σi(cid:15)(i)
t+1

(3)

(cid:17)

Mean reversion in the context of the process in (2) is usually understood as follows. The variables
for t > 0 are generally assumed to be N (0, 1) and uncorrelated. This means that, taking the

(cid:15)(i)
t
expected value (2) gives:

t+1 − ρ(i)
ρ(i)

t = κ(i) (cid:16)

µ(i) − ρ(i)
t

(cid:17)

(4)

where:

ρ(i)
t = E

(cid:105)

(cid:104)

x(i)
t

(5)

which solves out to:

(cid:16)

ρ(i)
t =

e−κ(i)t + µ(i)

0 − µ(i)(cid:17)
x(i)
As t → ∞, ρt → µ(i), i.e. to a long term equilibrium value: we say that the variable x(i)
reverts
t
back to it’s mean. If κ(i) is large enough, we see that, regardless of the value of x(i)
0 , reversion will
happen quickly. Plugging this back into (1) we see that the return on the portfolio consisting of
t − (cid:80)
S(i)
t will revert to µ(i) quickly. This presents a trading opportunity: if the current
value of the signal x(i)
is below µ(i), we go long and vice-versa since we know we don’t need to wait
t
for long before the return goes back to µ(i): this is the essence of mean reversion.

α ΛiαF (α)

(6)

Before discussing the estimation of the signal x(i)
t
needed for mean reversion to work:

, let’s recapitulate explicitly the two assumptions

1. the errors (cid:15)(i)

t are decorrelated with a mean of zero and

2. the mean ρ(i)

t = E

(cid:105)

(cid:104)

x(i)
t

has to tend to some ﬁxed equilibrium value

When these assumptions are met the problem reduces to determining the values of the mean rever-
sion parameters Λiα and bi. A brute force approach is the basic regression model where the mean
reversion parameters are calculated by minimising the overall error over some sample:

(cid:15)2 =

T
(cid:88)

t+1 − x(i)
x(i)

t − κ(i) (cid:16)

µ(i) − x(i)
t

(cid:17)(cid:17) 2

(7)
As the factors F may be highly correlated, a Tikhonov regularisation approach (sometimes also
known as a “ridge regression” in this context) is typically used where instead of minimising (7) one
adds a penalty term:

L = (cid:15)2 + λ

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
(cid:107)Λ(cid:107)2 − 1

(8)

Alternatively, we can ﬁrst determine Λ and η through a linear regression between the stock annd
the factors and then estimate equation (1) separately. Whatever the method used, the resulting
residuals are then used to detect potential trades.

The speciﬁc trading rule obviously depends on individual preferences but the typical elements that
go into the trade decision are:

1. if the current signal is above or below a certain “threshold” number of standard deviations

from the mean (where such thresholds depend on the investor’s risk aversion):

κ(i) (cid:16)

µ(i) − x(i)
t

(cid:17)

> nsellσi

κ(i) (cid:16)

µ(i) − x(i)
t

(cid:17)

< nbuyσi

(9)

(10)

2. another parameter of importance in setting mean reversion based trades is the typical time
before a deviation from the mean is corrected. This is given by the ﬁrst passage time of
the Ornsetin Uhlenbeck process (see [13]). The exact expression in [13] is complicated and
semi-analytical but, to gain some intuition, we can consider the ﬁrst passage time of the error
(cid:15)(i)
t

, i.e. we are asking for the typical value of the variable:

(cid:16)

ˆτ

t, (cid:15)(i)
t

(cid:17)

= argmins>0

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(cid:15)(i)
t+s = 0

(11)

For Brownian motion (which is typically assumed in the context of stochastic calculus), this can

be calculated as:

f (i)(t) = Prob

(cid:16)

(cid:16)

ˆτ

(12)

From the above distribution, the typical ﬁrst passage time, deﬁned by f (cid:48)(t) = 0 is given by:

(cid:16)

τ

t

(cid:17)

(cid:15)(i)

(13)

Equation (13) shows that, as intuitively expected, the typical mean reversion time increases the
further we are from the mean and decreases the more volatile the stock is.

Approaches based on mean reversion discussed previously suﬀer from two problems. First of all, one
assumes that the “error” (cid:15)(i)
in the idiosyncratic return is normally distributed. This assumption,
t
although sometimes valid, has no a priori justiﬁcation. The reasons why this assumption may fail
are many, not least of which the asymmetry in the behaviour of market participants during bull
and bear markets and the impact of liquidity. Furthermore, as we will discuss later, the standard
approach to calculating the parameters of the mean reversion in (1) is not geared towards insuring
that the resulting error is Gaussian as assumed.

The second problem is that these approaches are model-dependent: they assume that the model
representing the beta-hedged portfolio returns is aﬃne. This last assumption may sometimes be
justiﬁed if we interpret P (i)
t+1as the price the next minute or maybe the next hour: this is so because,
if we look closely enough, any curve looks like a straight line over very short intervals of time. But
this starts to fail for longer periods of time and does not adequately capture long term correlations
between prices. A less model dependent approach that tries to “learn” the data instead of coercing
it to a pre-determined model would, at least conceptually, be more appealing. Model risk has been
discussed in the literature (see references [4,7,10,17]), and some approaches to mitigation have been
proposed but most of the eﬀorts are around the risk inherent in the pricing of securities and ﬁnancial
instruments. Other statistical models used in ﬁnance, such as mean-reversion trading, have received
less attention.

3 Ditching the model

In this paper we propose an alternative approach to statistical arbitrage. Our ﬁrst point of call is
to deal with model risk by using a neural network as a universal approximator: neural networks with
a single hidden layer are universal approximators, i.e. any function can be expressed to an arbitrary
degree of accuracy by such a network. Put simply, if we specify a generic form for modeling asset
returns:

t+1 − x(i)
x(i)

t = Q

(cid:16)

x(1)
t

, .., x(N )
t

(cid:17)

+ σi(cid:15)(i)
t+1

(14)

where Q is some unknown function, the universal approximation theorem (see [9]) says that this
function can be “represented” as

(cid:16)

Q

x(1)
t

, .., x(N )
t

(cid:17)

(15)

j=1

where the matrices W and h are known as weights while the vector b is known as the bias, and
the function f is the activation. In this paper, the number of factors used is chosen to correspond
to the number of sector ETFs while H, the number of “hidden neurons” represents the architecture
of the model:

Figure 3: Generic neural network architecture

In ﬁgure 3, the architecture, which refers to the speciﬁc connections between the diﬀerent layers
of the network; is that of a “plain vanilla” feed forward network. Many other architectures are
possible such as convolutional neural networks, LSTM, transformer networks etc. The ﬁnancial
applications of these diﬀerent architectures are manifold but in this paper, we shall only explore the
use of feedforward networks as in equation (15).

Note that in the case of a linear activation, we recover equation (1) which is the basic aﬃne model
of mean reversion. Here however, the activation function used will be f (x) = tanh(x). Remem-
bering that equation (1) is the discretised version of a diﬀerential equation we have, under certain
conditions, a long term mean since:

and hence:

(17)

Since most activation functions used have the property f (0) = 0, the long term mean is charca-

terised by:

N
(cid:88)

j=1

Wαjx(j)

∞ + bα = 0

(18)

The condition of convergence for the diﬀerential form of (15) is given by the Picard-Lindelof

iteration which basically requires the mapping on the RHS of (15) to be contractive, i.e.:

|h(f (W x + b) − f (W y + b))| < k|x − y|

(19)

where | . | denotes some vector norm.

If the activation itself is a contractive mapping or at least Lipschitz, we will get (using the Cauchy
inequality):

(cid:107)h(f (W x + b) − f (W y + b))(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)h(cid:107) (cid:107)(f (W x + b) − f (W y + b))(cid:107)

which implies the constraint:

≤ ρ (cid:107)h(cid:107) (cid:107)W (x − y)(cid:107)

≤ ρ (cid:107)h(cid:107) (cid:107)W (cid:107) (cid:107)(x − y)(cid:107)

ρ (cid:107)h(cid:107) (cid:107)W (cid:107) < 1

Equation (21) is basically a regularisation condition that must be imposed on the model to
ensure it behaves well asymptotically. Such regularisation conditions are familiar in training neural
networks and serve to increase generalisation capacity for out-of-sample predictions by "clipping"
spurious weights and nodes from the architecture. In addition to this condition, dropout and drop
connect methods can be used to get more robust results.

In the neural network literature, determining the weight and bias parameters in equation (15)
is usually done by applying some variation on gradient descent method e.g., Stochastic Gradient
Decsent (SGD) or adaptive moment minimisation (ADAM [11]) to minimise the in-sample/training
error:

(cid:15)2 =

(22)

and the “correctness” of the results is then measured by the size of the error on the out-of sample

testing set.

4 Built-in mean reversion

As noted earlier, one of the weaknesses of traditional approaches to mean reversion is the as-
sumption that the idiosyncratic residual is basically white noise: a series of uncorrelated, zeero
mean random variables. White noise is characterised by a ﬂat power spectrum where the power
spectrum is deﬁned as the magnitude of its Fourier transform:

Φ [dˆst] (ω) =

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

dˆsteiωt

(cid:12)
2
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(23)

To intuitively understand (16), we recall that the Fourier transform of a signal is a decomposition
of the latter into periodic/sinusoidal waves with given amplitudes. When the amplitudes for all
possible frequencies are equal, we have have a ﬂat power spectrum: loosely speaking, it means that
there is no perceivable regularity in the signal.

Going back to equation (15), the calibration procedure by which the quantities Λ, h and b are
obtained from the observed idiosyncratic return (cid:15)(i)
t+1 must have the power spectrum of white noise.
This requirement can be fullﬁlled by minimising the following loss function:

p(i)
n =

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
T
(cid:88)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

with the loss function:

(24)

(25)

(26)

Equation (24) is the power spectrum of the error on the beta-hedged portfolio corresponding to
the ith stock. Equation (25) says that we would like to maximize the Shannon information in the
power spectrum. Since for any ﬁnite trading horizon T , (cid:80)T
n is bounded we deduce that when
the information (25) is maximal, the spectrum is ﬂat, i.e. corresponds to the requirement of mean
reversion.

n=1 p(i)

Traditionally, instead of the loss function in (25), one minimises the RMS distance:



t+1 − x(i)

Minimising (27) however, only guarantees that the ﬁrst moment (average) of the error will be
zero and that the standard deviation will be minimal but it does not guarantee any other properties
of the distribution of errors nor does it automatically say anything about their dependence structure.

5 Trading Strategy

Using the results from the preceding section, we would like to generate a trading signal akin to
the one in equations (9) and (10). However, we need to note that, in arriving to equations (9) and
(10), the parameters have been estimated in a way to make sure that E [(cid:15)t] = 0. The approach
outlined in the previous section does not guarantee this last equation since it maximises entropy
rather than minimises the mean square error. We therefore have to adapt our decision rule to reﬂect
this as follows:

or:

H
(cid:88)

α=1

(cid:88)



N
(cid:88)

Λαjx(j)

t + bα


 ≤ ω(i) − nsellσ(i)

j=1

(28)

(29)

where ω(i) is the (arithmetic) mean of the error. Put simply, equations (28-29) tell us that if the
signal is large enough, we should buy, else we should sell !

The speciﬁc thresholds, as discussed earlier, are a function of the risk aversion of individual in-
vestors and, possibly, of the speciﬁc stocks and ETFs being traded. The amount traded can, in
principle, be a function of the signal strength and other important variables such as trade volume.
In this paper, our focus is really on measuring the impact on statistical arbitrage strategies that
comes from ditching pre-speciﬁed models (by using neural networks as discussed previously) and
changing the way in which parameters are estimated. Therefore, we deem that optimising thresh-
olds or allocations may “muddy the waters” in terms of understanding the eﬃcacy of the outlined
approach. As such, we have chosen to use a ﬂat allocation where the same amount is traded re-
gardless of the signal strength and nbuy = nsell = 2.

Table 1.

List of ETF factors used

Following [1], we used actual as opposed to synthetic ETFs for backtesting as of 2005. The data
was obtained from Yahoo Finance and missing values were linearly interpolated. The dataset was
divided 50/50 into training and testing datasets. No attempt was made to evaluate performance on
separate historical patches on purpose: we do not want to feed the approach with knowledge gained
in hindsight. We also do not take transaction costs, repo rates (for short selling) or borrowing rates
into account in this paper.

Unlike linear regression analysis, calibrating the parameters of a neural network has no analytic
solution and as such is a numerical gradient-descent based procedure. Such procedures rarely lead
to a global optimum and frequently end up in diﬀerent local minima upon repetition. We deal with
this by averaging the signal over multiple runs (we have used 1000 such runs in this paper) which
leads to a fairly stable outcome.

The trading strategy’s P&L is summarised by:

Π(i)

t = s(i)

All of these histograms show returns that are considerably positively skewed. Also, for most
companies examined, the percentage of correct trade decisions, i.e. decisions resulting in a positive
P&L, ’sell’ decisions were more likely to be correct than buy decisions.

The reason for the long holding time is the thresholds in equations (28) and (29): these are
quite high and thererfore necessitate long waiting times before unwinding the trades becomes "safe".
Finding optimal bounds for these thresholds is in itself the topic of a diﬀerent study and is quite
likely to be speciﬁc to the stocks being traded.

In this paper, we have explored the impact of using model independent estimators for stock returns
and calibrating their parameters in a way that guarantees mean reversion. The results are quite
encouraging and suggest future work that focuses on:

• Optimising the architecture of the neural network used

• Finding a more scientiﬁc way of determining appropriate threresholds for trading

• Examining the impact of using a non-Markovian approach where current returns depend on

longer histories of prices and returns.
