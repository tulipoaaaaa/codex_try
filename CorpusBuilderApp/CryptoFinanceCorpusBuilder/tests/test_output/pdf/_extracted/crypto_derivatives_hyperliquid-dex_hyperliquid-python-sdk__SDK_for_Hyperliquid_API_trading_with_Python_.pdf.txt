Set the public key as the account_address  in examples/config.json.
Set your private key as the secret_key  in examples/config.json.
See the example of loading the config in examples/example_utils.py
Generate and authorize a new API private key on https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/API, and set the API wallet's private key as the
secret_key  in examples/config.json. Note that you must still set the public key of the main wallet not the API wallet as the
account_address  in examples/config.json
See examples for more complete examples. You can also checkout the repo and run any of the examples after configuring your
private key e.g.
1. Download Poetry : https://python-poetry.org/.
Note that in the install script you might have to set symlinks=True  in venv.EnvBuilder .
Note that Poetry v2 is not supported, so you'll need to specify a specific version e.g. curl -sSL https://install.python-
poetry.org | POETRY_VERSION=1.4.1 python3 -
2. Point poetry to correct version of python. For development we require python 3.10 exactly. Some dependencies have issues
on 3.11, while older versions don't have correct typing support. brew install python@3.10 && poetry env use 
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.10/3.10.16/bin/python3.10
3. Install dependencies:
CLI commands for faster development. See make help  for more details.
Configuration
[Optional] Generate a new API key for an API Wallet
Usage Examples
from hyperliquid.info import Info
from hyperliquid.utils import constants
info = Info(constants.TESTNET_API_URL, skip_ws=True)
user_state = info.user_state("0xcd5051944f780a621ee62e39e493c489668acf4d")
print(user_state)
