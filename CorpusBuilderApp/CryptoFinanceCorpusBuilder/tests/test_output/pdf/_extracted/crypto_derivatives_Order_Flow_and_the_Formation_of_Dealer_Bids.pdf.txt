Abstract

Is privately observed order ﬂow an important component of the strategic price formation

process in government securities markets? Utilizing a detailed data set on Government of

Canada securities auctions, we argue that the answer is yes. Government securities dealers

who participate in these auctions have access to private order ﬂow information through two

channels: non-dealer customer bids that are, by the rules of the auction, routed through

dealers, and when-issued market transactions undertaken by the dealers. Dealer bids respond

strongly to privately observed customer bids and when-issued market positions, and dealers

who observe a larger number of customer bids can predict the auction cutoﬀ price better. We

also document patterns of customer bidding behavior consistent with a strategic response to

dealers’ use of the information contained in customer bids.

A large theoretical literature in ﬁnancial economics studies how trading mechanisms aggregate

individual traders’ private information regarding asset values into asset prices.1 However, it is

not always easy to identify the precise sources of private information in some important asset

markets. For example, in the vast markets for government securities, most, if not all, traders

have access to the same ﬁnancial and political data and news needed to value the ﬁxed cash ﬂow

streams, making it diﬃcult to argue for private information playing a role.

Recent empirical research, however, yields evidence consistent with the existence of private

information in government securities markets. Green (2004) ﬁnds that sensitivity of prices to order

ﬂow in the U.S. treasury market increases following economic announcements. This suggests that

such announcements increase the amount of information asymmetry in this market. Brandt and

Kavajecz (2004) point out that there are signiﬁcant price changes in the U.S. treasury market

in days without news announcements. Following the methodology of Evans and Lyons (2002),

they show that orderﬂow imbalances (as measured by signed trades) can account for 26% of the

day-to-day variation of yields in days without news announcements.

The existence of private information in government securities markets is also a key assump-

tion underlying theoretical and empirical analyses of Treasury auctions.2 However, the existing

literature on government securities auctions, while ascribing a central role to private information,

is not able to identify its source directly. Isolating what drives private information is important

in these markets, since theoretical and policy analyses regarding the design of the auction and

surrounding market rules rely very sensitively on the exact speciﬁcation of the informational and

strategic environment.3

This paper shows that an important source of private information for government securities

dealers is (privately observed) customer order ﬂow. This mechanism was ﬁrst noted, but not

empirically documented, by Nyborg and Sundaresan (1996, page 68). We provide direct evidence

for it using very detailed data from Government of Canada securities auctions, where we have

the unique ability to relate the bidding behavior of government securities dealers to two sources

of private information.

The ﬁrst source of dealers’ private information are non-dealer customers who place their own

bids in the auctions, but who, by regulation, have to route their bids through dealers. Our data

set allows us to observe these customer bids at the dealer level. Moreover, since the computerized

auction system of the Bank of Canada allows bidders to modify their bid entries until the bid

submission deadline,4 we can track changes made to customer and dealer bids before they become

oﬃcial.

The second source of private information is the “when-issued” market, where dealers and

customers sign forward contracts. Our data set allows us to track the evolution of dealers’ net

long or short positions in this market during the period preceding each auction, thus allowing us

to reconstruct this dimension of dealers’ private information as well.

Our analysis uncovers a strong response of dealers’ bidding behavior to customer order ﬂow,

and a rich array of strategic behavior that arises from the manner in which private information

is gathered and utilized in this market.

In Section 1, we note that “when-issued” trading is

done exclusively through the informationally opaque channel of bilateral negotiations, and not

through the more transparent medium of electronic interdealer brokers.5 This suggests that

valuable information is gathered on the when-issued market. Section 2 provides more details of

the “information-gathering” process that precedes each auction. We show that bidding activity is

very much concentrated in the last few minutes preceding the submission deadline, that dealers

who route customer bids are the latest to submit their oﬃcial bids (and that their bids lag their

customers’ bids), and that bids submitted closer to the deadline are much less dispersed and more

informative of the auction outcome than earlier bids.

Section 3 presents our key results, where we use bid-level data to examine the response of

dealers’ bids to privately observed customer order ﬂow. We ﬁnd that dealer’s bids, and especially

the modiﬁcations they make to their bids reﬂect the information contained in customer bids. Net

positions obtained in the when-issued market also aﬀect dealers’ bidding in a manner consistent

with the model of Nyborg and Strebulaev (2004). Moreover, we demonstrate that access to

customer order ﬂow increases dealers’ bidding eﬀectiveness: dealers with access to order ﬂow

information from a larger number of customers win a higher proportion of the securities they bid

for, but do not pay more (per unit) than other bidders.

If access to customer order ﬂow provides an informational advantage to dealers, we may expect

customers to devise strategies to lessen any adverse consequences of this advantage on their own

trading outcomes.

Indeed, in section 4, we document evidence suggestive of several customer

“strategies.” One strategy is to divide bids across multiple dealers; which appears to be used

4At the bid submission deadline, bids are deemed “oﬃcial,” and securities are allocated using a discriminatory

(pay-as-bid) pricing mechanism. Until the auction results are announced, bids are kept secret from competing

bidders. We explain the institutional features in more detail in Section 1.

5However, dealers have to report large changes to their net positions to the Bank of Canada; our data captures

these reports.

more often when the customer has a larger order. Another strategy is to establish a long-term

relationship with a dealer. Yet another customer strategy that we have suggestive evidence for is

to delay one’s bid as much as possible, so that the dealer does not have time to revise her own

bid based on the customer’s bid.

Should the Government of Canada eliminate the informational advantage of dealers by allowing

customers to participate directly in the auctions? Section 5 of the paper and the Appendix discuss

the revenue and eﬃciency consequences of such a policy change within the context of a simple,

stylized model.

Along with establishing an economic mechanism through which order ﬂow aﬀects asset prices

in government securities markets, our study contributes to the empirical microstructure literature

in two ways.6 First, the cross-sectional nature of our data set allows us to conclude that access to

order ﬂow is an important factor explaining the variation in bidding behavior and performance

across participants in the Government of Canada securities market. Such a cross-sectional conclu-

sion could not have been obtained from previous dealer-level studies of microstructure hypotheses,

such as Lyons (1995) and Madhavan and Smidt (1991), as these studies utilized transactions data

from a single dealer.7

Second, the panel nature of our data allows us to account for one of the chief empirical con-

founds of the empirical microstructure literature in a convincing manner. Any study attempting

to link (dealer) trading behavior to proxies for order ﬂow has to account for the possibility that

both order ﬂow and dealer trading may be correlated solely through their response to public

information ﬂows that are observed by all market participants, but unobservable to the econome-

trician.

One way to address this problem is to study the response of trading to privately observed

order-ﬂow across multiple dealers. Diﬀerences in dealer behavior, controlling for other factors

leading to dealer heterogeneity, should be attributable to privately observed order ﬂow; not to

public information that all dealers observe. This is exactly our identiﬁcation strategy: since we

observe multiple dealers bidding in the same auction (and revising their bids within the same

pre-auction period), we look at the diﬀerences across dealers’ bids and bid modiﬁcations, and see

how these covary with privately observed order ﬂow.8

6Examples from this literature include work on foreign exchange markets (Lyons (2001) and the references

within, Evans and Lyons (2002), Ito, Lyons and Melvin (1998)), equity markets (Hansch, Naik and Viswanathan

(1998)) and option markets (Easley, O’Hara and Srinivas (1998)).

7Lyons (1995) uses data obtained from a large currency dealer to test whether the prices quoted by this dealer

responds to changes in the inventory holdings and customer orders observed by this dealer. Madhavan and Smidt

(1991) analyze NYSE specialists’ trades.

8An alternative identiﬁcation strategy is pursued by the single dealer analyses of Madhavan and Smidt (1991)

I. Description of Data and Surrounding Institutions

The Bank of Canada, on behalf of the Government of Canada (GoC), issues bonds and treasury

bills. Bonds are long-term securities and treasury bills are short-term securities.10 The average

issue size for bonds and treasury bills is 5.5 and 2.4 billion Canadian dollars, respectively. Besides

the large absolute magnitude of the issuance size, government securities are the backbone of the

ﬁxed-income securities market in Canada. Government securities account for 72% of the ﬁxed

income market in Canada.11

The process for issuing a “typical” GoC debt instrument links three markets: the when-issued

market, the primary market or the auction, and the secondary market. The bidding process

begins with the Bank of Canada soliciting bids in the primary market. The when-issued market

for the auctioned security also begins with this solicitation. Government securities distributors12

typically take short positions in the when-issued market through forward contracts for the yet-to-

be auctioned security. Subsequently, dealers attempt to cover these short positions by buying the

security from other dealers in the when-issued market, from the issuer in the primary market, and

ﬁnally from another dealer in the secondary market after the auction. Trading for the auctioned

security begins in the secondary market 15-20 minutes after the bid submission deadline.

It is signiﬁcant to note the overlap of trading in the when-issued market and the bid preparation

process in the primary market in the period preceding the bid submission deadline. The overlap of

these two processes makes it possible for a dealer to gather orderﬂow information from customers

in both the when-issued market and the primary market, and respond strategically in one market

to orderﬂow information gathered in the other. We now detail some further aspects of these

markets.

and Lyons (1995), who utilized an explicit structural speciﬁcation of the evolution of public information and the

dealer’s optimal response to it, which leads to a reduced-form speciﬁcation in which the contribution of unobserved
public information to changes in price quotes is an orthogonal error term.9 Note that while we use the ﬁrst-

diﬀerencing strategy of these papers when analyzing the response of bid modiﬁcations to order ﬂow in Section 3.A,

our ability to observe multiple dealers allows us to eschew the orthogonality assumption.

10Bonds have a maturity of 30, 10, 5 and 2 years, and treasury bills with a maturity of 1 year, 3 months and 6

months. Treasury bills are zero-coupon bonds.

A. Primary Market

The Bank of Canada issues GoC securities in the primary market through sealed-bid discrim-

inatory (pay-as-bid) auctions. The auctions are conducted on an electronic system: a bidder

communicates his bid in real-time on a secure electronic system that can be viewed only by the

Bank of Canada.

On average, 26.2 bidders participate in an auction. Potential bidders in the government

securities auctions can be classiﬁed into three groups: primary dealers (PDs), other government

securities distributors (GSDs) and customers. “Other government securities distributors” refers

to government securities distributors excluding primary dealers. On an average, 12.7 PDs, 4.9

GSDs, and 8.6 customers participate in an auction. Of these, PDs account for as large as 90% of

the primary market in terms of the volume of securities issued. Individually, PDs are the largest

bidders, though GSD and customer bids are similar in size. The average PD bid is for 13.4%

of the total issue amount, the average GSD bid is for 2.7%, and the average customer bid is for

2.4%.

The distinction between government securities distributors (PDs and GSDs) and customers is

that the latter cannot bid on their own account in the auction; rather government securities dis-

tributors submit bids on behalf of customers.13 Thus, Government securities distributors submit

bids on their account and on behalf of the customers, being “bidders” in the former and “sub-

mitters” in the latter case. We see that an average dealer services 0.8 customers in an auction.

Customers can choose to route their bids through more than one dealer in the auction. On an

average, a customer routes bids through 1.5 dealers in an auction.

In general, the maximum amount that a dealer can bid either for himself or his customers, is

based on his past primary market winning share and secondary market trading share, net of his

current holdings of the auctioned security. But the Bank of Canada stipulates that no bidder in

an auction can bid for more than 25% of the issue amount, and no dealer as a “submitter” can

bid for more than 40% of the issue amount whether on his own account or that of his customers.14

Bids can be submitted as competitive tenders and noncompetitive tenders.15 Typically, a

13Government securities distributors do not charge a fee to route customer bids.
14The distinction between primary dealers and other government securities dealers is based on the diﬀerences in

their shares of the primary and secondary markets. Thus, while primary dealers can bid the maximum amount

allowed by the Bank of Canada to a “bidder” or a “submitter”, government securities distributors cannot. As an

example in Treasury bill auctions, government securities distributors can bid only a maximum of 10% of the issue

amount of an auction net of their current holdings of the auctioned security.

15A noncompetitive tender comprises a quantity subject to an upper bound of $3 million, with a participant being

allowed to submit a single noncompetitive tender.

6

participant’s competitive tender will comprise of price-quantity pairs and the participant’s net

position of the yet-to-be auctioned security at the point of time the tender is submitted.16 The

reported net position is the participant’s net holdings (whether long or short) of the security being

auctioned at that point of time, and capture the forward contracts of a dealer with other dealers

or customers, prior to the auction. On average, dealers’ contracted positions comprise 54.1% of

the issue amount.

All tenders have to be submitted before the expiry of the bid submission deadline. However,

participants can revise or cancel previously submitted tenders prior to the auction deadline; there

are no limits on the number of revisions that an auction participant can make. Tenders submit-

ted after the bid submission deadline are cancelled unless they are on account of transmission

failure. After the expiry of the bid submission deadline, submitted tenders are allotted through

a discriminatory price auction. The awards are announced 15 minutes after the bid submission

deadline, with the announcement including the cutoﬀ price, the amount issued, the quantity

weighted average price, and the low and high yields.

Our data captures several aspects of the primary market. For the primary market we have data

over the period October 1998 to March 2003. In particular, we have 347 treasury-bill auction and

66 bond auctions in our sample. For each auction in the sample, we have auction-level information

reﬂecting the total issue and bid amounts and the cutoﬀ yield (or market clearing price).

In

addition, we have detailed information regarding the entire sequence of tenders submitted by the

bidders. For each tender, we observe a time-stamp, indicating the exact time at which the tender

was submitted; the participant type of the bidder (primary dealer, other government securities

distributor, customer, Bank of Canada); if the bid belongs to a customer, the submitter who

entered the bid into the system (who has to be a primary dealer or other government securities

distributor); net position amount indicating a participant’s net holdings of the yet-to-be auctioned

security at that time the allotted tenders of each bidder. Finally, for each tender submitted in an

auction by a bidder, we have the bid amount and yield pairs; the maximum amount a participant

can bid as a “submitter”, and as a “bidder”; and the amount allotted to each participant.

Note that a bidder can revise a submitted tender before the auction deadline, and our data set

captures the entire history of these revisions. For each auction participant, the unique tender and

the constituent bids in this tender that are used to determine the cutoﬀ yield and the allotment

of the auctioned security is referred to as oﬃcial data.17 Thus, the oﬃcial data is a subset of the

16A customer’s tender may comprise only price-quantity pairs as a customer has the option of submitting his net

positions directly to the Bank of Canada instead of communicating it through the tender(s) he submits through

dealers.

17An oﬃcial tender is the last submitted or cancelled tender of a participant.

history data. While several empirical studies of treasury auctions have used data on oﬃcial bids,

this is the ﬁrst paper that makes use of the history aspect of treasury auction data.

B. “When-Issued” and Secondary Markets

The when-issued market oﬃcially begins a week before the bid submission deadline in the primary

market. In this period both the primary and when-issued market are open. Participants engage in

forward trading for the yet-to-be auctioned security in the when-issued market. Also, the primary

market is followed by trading in an active resale market for the “new issue” called the secondary

market.

Both the when-issued and the secondary markets operate through two channels. The ﬁrst

is a bilateral, telephone-based over-the-counter market, and the second is an interdealer market

operated by electronic interdealer-brokers.

Non-dealer customers’ when-issued and secondary market transactions are conducted on the

over-the-counter market. Institutional investors (for example, pension funds, mutual funds) trade

with dealers on a bilateral basis over the telephone, with the result of these transactions known

only to the two counterparties participating in the transaction. In 2002, customer-dealer over-

the-counter transactions accounted for 54% of the total volume traded of Government of Canada

bonds.

Dealers, on the other hand, can use both the over-the-counter channel or the electronic

interdealer-broker channel. Electronic interdealear brokers post on an electronic screen bid, oﬀers,

and trade outcomes communicated to him by the dealers.18 In 2002, 86% of the total interdealer

transactions volume was brokered through these electronic interdealer brokers. As said, only deal-

ers can post quotes or trade through the interdealer brokers. However, both customers and dealers

have viewing access to the electronic screens of an interdealer broker via CanPX, a data service

that consolidates and disseminates the trade and quote information provided by the electronic

interdealer brokers.19

We do not have real-time quote or trade data for over-the-counter transactions. However, we

do observe this market through the net positions that bidders report when they submit tenders

in the primary market. This allows us to construct a bidder-level proxy of the transactions ﬂow

leading up to an auction.

In contrast, we do have access to transactions level data from CanPX, allowing us to observe

18Typically, the identity of the dealer is not revealed.
19Prior to the establishment of CanPX, only dealers could observe the trade and quote activity on the electronic

interdealer-broker screens.

8

trade and quote activity in real-time in the interdealer market over the period July 4, 2001 to

September 10, 2001, and February 25, 2002 to February 27, 2003. This data, at least in principle,

allows us to track activity on the when-issued and secondary markets.

However, to our initial surprise, when we looked at CanPX data to investigate interdealer

trading patterns in the when-issued market for a one-week window prior to the auction, we

observed no trade or quote activity for the yet-to-be-auctioned security during the entire set of

security issues covered by our sample. We should note that Nyborg and Sundaresan (1996) found

a very similar lack of liquidity in the U.S. when-issued interdealer market in the period prior to

the auction.

Our ﬁnding that no when-issued trades are observable on CanPX was, at ﬁrst, puzzling,

given that the basis for a when-issued market is price discovery. However, as evidenced from our

observation of the levels and changes in the declared net positions of the bidders, there is indeed

an active market for when-issued trading. Yet, none of this trading shows up on CanPX, and

appears to be conducted exclusively on the over-the-counter market. Since transactions on the

over-the-counter market are bilateral, and are not, to our knowledge, publicly observable, this

ﬁnding appears to be consistent with the intuition of Bikhchandani et al. (1994), Simon (1994),

and Nyborg and Sundaresan (1996) that pre-auction when-issued transactions carry important

informational content that dealers do not want to share with other market participants.

II. Dynamics of Bid Submission

Our ﬁnding in the previous section that the “when-issued” market operates operates exclusively

through the opaque over-the-counter market suggests that dealer-customer interactions carry

economically important information. A corollary of this observation is that dealers should wait

to gather as much information from their customers before ﬁnalizing their bidding decisions.

We ﬁnd strong evidence in support of this hypothesis. Bank of Canada securities auctions

have a ﬁxed bid submission deadline, and bidders are allowed to submit bids for a particular

auction two weeks ahead of time. However, bidding activity is concentrated within the last few

minutes before the deadline. In Figure 1, we use the time stamps of tenders to plot the cumulative

distribution function of oﬃcial 20 bid submission times for diﬀerent subsamples of our data set.

Observe that ninety percent of all competitive bids, those that specify a price as well as a quantity,

are submitted in the last 20 minutes of the submission deadline. In contrast, observe that non-

competitive bids, i.e. those that do not specify a price, tend to come much earlier than competitive

20Recall that “oﬃcial” bids are the ﬁnal bid submissions that are taken into account for the allocation.

bids. The median competitive bid comes in 7.9 minutes before the deadline, whereas the median

non-competitive bids comes in 26.5 minutes before the deadline.

One explanation for the last-minute concentration of bids is that, especially for competitive

bids, new information is very important in forming expectations about the appropriate value of

the security being auctioned. Hence, bidders are reluctant to commit to a price bid until they

are certain that no new information will be released.21 Note that bidding in bond auctions is

much more concentrated at the very last minutes of the auction, with the median oﬃcial bid

for bonds coming 2.5 minutes before the auction deadline, as opposed to 9.3 minutes for T-bills.

Pricing longer maturity securities depends quite sensitively on expectations about the future,

and since many more factors enter into forming expectations about the long-term rather than the

short-term, one may expect bidding decisions to be more responsive to arrival of new information.

Yet another pattern that supports the information gathering hypothesis is that bids that

come within time intervals closer to the bidding deadline are less dispersed, and, controlling for

bid volume within a given time interval, are closer to the market clearing price than bids submitted

within earlier time intervals.22 To show this, we ﬁrst categorized oﬃcial bids by clustering their

submission times into 5 minute periods leading up to the deadline. Since bids come in the form of

multiple price-quantity pairs, i.e. demand schedules, we calculated the quantity weighted average

price of each bid schedule (made up of K price-quantity pairs) by the formula:

pQW =

(cid:80)K
(cid:80)K

i=1 piqi
i=1 qi

(1)

We then calculated two dispersion measures of the bids submitted in diﬀerent time intervals. The

ﬁrst measure is the standard deviation of (quantity-weighted) price bids submitted within a given

interval. The second measure we use is the absolute dispersion of the (quantity-weighted) price

bid around the cutoﬀ/market-clearing price of the auction, i.e. lowest price at which the securities

21The explanation for last-minute can not be pure “procrastination” by dealers, since we observe some dealers

submitting both competitive and non-competitive bid in a given auction, where the non-competitive bid is submitted

earlier than the competitive bid. Note also that the phenomenon we are observing is similar to the “sniping”, or

“last minute bidding” phenomenon that has been documented in the context of Internet auctions by Roth and

Ockenfels (2002) and Bajari and Horta¸csu (2003). Internet auctions are open-ascending auctions where bidders can

see and respond to each others bids; this creates several strategic reasons for “sniping.” Although Bank of Canada

securities auctions are sealed bid auctions in which dealers do not observe and cannot respond to other dealers’

bidding activity, dealers can observe and respond to the bidding activity of customers who route bids through them,

and have the incentive to wait for these bids to arrive.

22These patterns echo the ﬁndings of Biais, Hillion and Spatt (1999) in the opening periods of the Paris Bourse.

Mjt(cid:88)

|pQW

m − pc
j|

(2)

where pc

j is the cutoﬀ price in auction j. Again, this is a measure of how close the bids submitted

in a given time interval are to being the marginal bid in the auction.23

We then regress our dispersion measures on time-interval indicators and bid volume in time

period t, to see if bid-dispersion around the market clearing price declines over time. The results

are reported in Table 1, where we break down the results into the two subsamples of T-bill and

bond auctions.

In each regression, we control for auction-level ﬁxed eﬀects to isolate within-

auction temporal patterns. We see that in bond auctions, the dispersion of bids around the

market clearing price declines monotonically as the bidding interval gets closer to the deadline.

A similar trend also reveals itself when we look at the standard deviation of bids within a given

interval. However, in treasury bill auctions, the trend almost reverses, with later bids displaying

a higher degree of dispersion than earlier bids. Thus, our results indicate that in bond auctions,

bids that are submitted closer to the bidding deadline are less-dispersed than earlier bids, and that

they tend to be closer to the market-clearing price. This supports the presence of an information

gathering process leading up to bond auctions. However, the same process does not appear to be

important in T-bill auctions.

We next examine dealer-level data to test the information-gathering hypothesis. Table 2(a)

looks at all instances in which a dealer submitted a bid on her own behalf as well as for customers.

We then compare the submission time of the latest customer bid to the submission time of the

dealer’s own oﬃcial bid using a pairwise t-test (i.e. the within dealer diﬀerence). The test, when

conducted for the entire spectrum of maturities, reveals that dealer bids lag the latest customer

bid by 0.43 minutes, the diﬀerence being statistically signiﬁcant at the 1.7% level. Furthermore,

we ﬁnd that dealer bids lag customer bids 55% of the time. However, as the next column of

Table 2(a) shows, the diﬀerence in the timing between dealer and customer bids do not appear

to statistically diﬀerent for Treasury bills. Dealer bids lag customer bids 52% of the time – not

visibly (or, as it appears, statistically) diﬀerent from an even split.

23Since Bank of Canada securities auctions follow the discriminatory (pay-your-bid) pricing format, bidders have

an incentive to bid prices that are as close to the cutoﬀ price as possible. If the cutoﬀ price was known to the

bidders, all of them would submit bids that are equal to the cutoﬀ price. Of course, in reality, bidders do not know

the cutoﬀ price and have to balance the risk of paying too much vs. not winning the auction. However, one has

to control for the bid volume submitted within a time interval to make sure that bid volume does not cause these

bids to become marginal. We thank the referee for pointing this out.

11

In contrast, dealer bids appear to lag customer bids much more visibly in auctions for longer-

term securities. Not only both customer and dealer appear to come much later for these auctions;

dealer bids, on average, are submitted 2.5 minutes later than the latest customer bid. The lag

is statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level. Moreover, dealer bids lag customer bids 74.9% of the

time in these auctions.

As a second test, we compare the oﬃcial bid submission times of dealers who route customer

bids with dealers who do not route customer bids.24 Although both types of dealers conduct trans-

actions on the when-issued market, dealers with customers have additional information coming

from customer bids. This might drive them to bid later than dealers without customers, especially

if customers are also transacting in the when-issued market before submitting bids through their

dealers.

To implement this test, we ran the following regression:

T imeT oDeadlineij = a1 ∗ I(i ∈ {Dealers without Customers}) + a2 ∗ I(i ∈ {Customers})

+b ∗ BidQuantityij + uj + εij

(3)

where T imeT oDeadlineij is the minutes before the bidding deadline that bidder i submitted her

oﬃcial bid in auction j; BidQuantityij is the quantity bid of i, and uj is an auction ﬁxed-eﬀect.

Dealers with customers are the excluded category of agents in this regression. With the auction

ﬁxed eﬀects, this regression isolates within-auction diﬀerences in oﬃcial bid submission times

across customers, dealers without customers, and dealers with customers.

Table 2(b) reports the results of this regression, again broken down into the subsamples of

T-bill and bond auctions. We see, consistent with previous results, that in T-bill auctions there

are no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences across dealer (with or without customer) and customer

bid timings. However, in bond auctions, it appears that dealers without customers submit their

oﬃcial bids 1.32 minutes earlier than dealers with customers, and that customer bids are routed

2.18 minutes earlier. Furthermore, in both types of auctions, we ﬁnd that larger bids are submitted

later than bids for small quantities – which suggests that bidders with larger payoﬀs at stake wait

longer to bid, possibly in order to beneﬁt from any extra information they may gather before

making their ﬁnal bidding decision. Hence, the evidence once again suggests that dealers react

to the information contained in their customers’ bids when and where it matters. The ﬁndings

also conﬁrm our intuition regarding the diﬀerence in the importance of “customer information”

across bond vs. T-bill auctions.

III. How Does Private Order Flow Information Aﬀect Dealer Bid-

ding Behavior?

We now investigate whether the observed diﬀerences in dealer bids within a given auction can be

explained by the order ﬂow information that is observed privately by each dealer. As explained

in Section 1, a dealer may obtain private information about order-ﬂow from two sources: through

the transactions she conducts on the over-the-counter when-issued market, and through customer

bids routed through her.

Speciﬁcally, the regression speciﬁcation we use to test this is:

In this speciﬁcation, j indexes auctions in our data set, while i indexes dealers within an

auction. The dependent variable, DealerP QW

, is dealer i’s quantity-weighted price bid in auction

is dealer i’s customer’s quantity-weighed price

bid, minus the cutoﬀ-price (this is averaged over diﬀerent customers if dealer i submits bids for

multiple customers). N etP osij is dealer i’s declared net position in auction j. We normalize the

net position amount of the dealer by the dealer’s maximum submission limit, BidLimitij, which

we also take as a proxy of the size of the dealer’s demand. To account for any constraints that
the submission limit may put on a dealer’s price bid, we also control for the ratios DealerQij
BidLimitij
CustQij
BidLimitij
for her own bid vs. customers’ bids.

. These respectively account for the fraction of submission capacity that a dealer uses

, and

As pointed out in the introduction, dealer bids may respond to public as well as private

information ﬂows; thus variation in dealer bids across auctions may reﬂect unobserved (to the

econometrician) variation in public information ﬂows as well as variation in private information

ﬂows. In the above speciﬁcation, the auction ﬁxed-eﬀect, uj, serves to capture the unobservable

component of dealer bids common to all dealers’ participating in the auction, presumably due to
public information ﬂows.25 We also include a dealer ﬁxed-eﬀect term, γi, to control for systematic

25One could also proxy for public information ﬂows using real-time trading prices on the “when-issued” market,

or prices of securities that might be close substitutes. As noted in Section 1.B, however, CanPX is conspicuously

silent during the period preceding the auction. Although there is some trading activity in other securities, in

most cases, they have very diﬀerent maturities and/or coupon structures. Nyborg and Sundaresan (1996) note the

problems attached to using yield-curve based valuation benchmarks. Even in the cases where there is a maturity

and cash-ﬂow structure match, the auctioned security and the security trading on CanPX are not direct substitutes

due to the liquidity premium attached to the benchmark issue, mimicking the “on-the-run” premium in the U.S.

13

diﬀerences across the bidding patterns of dealers that do not vary from auction-to-auction. Note

that, in contrast, “order ﬂow” information possessed by a dealer varies from auction to auction.

In Section 3.B, we control for unobserved dealer heterogeneity that is allowed to vary from auction

to auction.

The results of the above regression are reported in Table 3. We ﬁrst report the results of the

regressions without dealer ﬁxed-eﬀects. The ﬁrst coeﬃcient estimate in Column (1) of the table

shows that one cent increase in customers’ bids is associated with a 0.59 cent increase in a dealer’s

own bid. This estimate is highly statistically signiﬁcant. Note also that the net position of the

dealer enters very signiﬁcantly into the regression. The coeﬃcient estimates indicate that dealers

with long (positive) positions bid less aggressively. One explanation for this might be that dealers

taking on large short positions are wary of being squeezed in the resale market, and consequently

bid more aggressively.

Our ﬁndings regarding the impact of net positions on bidding behavior is consistent with

the theoretical results of Nyborg and Strebulaev (2004) who analyze a strategic model of short

squeezes in discriminatory auctions. In the equilibria they analyze, dealers with short positions

bid more aggressively than dealers with zero net positions to avoid a squeeze in the resale mar-

ket. Interestingly, their results also indicate that dealers who have long positions also bid more

aggressively. Intuitively, this arises from the fact that dealers who are long have the incentive to

create and therefore proﬁt from a squeeze; but they can only do this if they outbid some of the

shorts.26

Columns (2) and (3) of this table replicate the same regressions on the subsamples of T-bill

and bond auctions, respectively. Note that the correlation between dealer and customer bids is

0.598 for bonds, as opposed to 0.158 for T-bills, which, consistent with the results in the previous

section, suggests that customer bids are more inﬂuential drivers of dealer bids in bond auctions.

Binding bid limits would suggest that dealers who are bidding for larger amounts (compared

to their bidding limits) would bid more aggressively. While this appears to be the case in T-bill

auctions, we ﬁnd the reverse pattern in bond auctions. This is consistent with the asymmetry we

have noted between long and short-term government securities: since dealers are less uncertain

about the market clearing price for T-bills relative to bonds, they appear to be willing to bet

Treasury market documented by Fleming (2001, 2002).

26To test this prediction, we ran the regressions in Table 3 by introducing long and short positions separately into

the speciﬁcation, and obtained that both short and long positions lead to more aggressive bidding. However, our

results indicated that dealers who are short bid much more aggressively than dealers with comparably-sized long

positions – thus the overall negative coeﬃcient reported in Table 2. We should note that Nyborg and Strebulaev’s

results also suggest that shorts should be expected to bid much more aggressively than longs.

, do not

appear to aﬀect the price level of dealer bids signiﬁcantly.

In Columns (4)-(6), we run the same regressions with dealer-level ﬁxed eﬀects added into the

speciﬁcation. Some dealers may systematically bid higher than others due to diﬀerences in their

demand for the security; dealer ﬁxed-eﬀects attempt to capture such unobserved drivers of dealer

demand.

Indeed, the R2’s of the regressions indicate that dealer ﬁxed eﬀects capture a lot of

the variation in the bids. However, the correlations between customer bids and dealer bids still

remain at very similar levels, indicating that the estimated dealer response to customer bids is

not attributable to unobserved systematic diﬀerences across dealers.

A. Dealer Bid Revisions

We can conclude from the previous results that there is a robust correlation between dealer and

customer orderﬂow (as measured by customer bids and net positions), and that this helps explain

the variation in dealer bids within a given auction. However, the variation in dealer bids may in

fact be driven by other, unobserved sources of dealer-level heterogeneity with which our orderﬂow

variables merely happen to be correlated.27 Thus, we now reﬁne the causal interpretation of our

analysis by looking at bid revisions. In particular, we test whether these bid revisions can be

explained by innovations to a dealer’s information set through changes in the dealer’s net position

and bid revisions by customers.

To do this, we utilize the bid history aspect of our data set, which comprises of all bids

submitted by the dealers, not just the oﬃcial bids. This allows us to track the modiﬁcations that

dealers make in their bids on Bank of Canada’s computerized bidding system.

To calculate modiﬁcations in dealers’ bids, we ﬁx a time interval, starting T = 10 or T = 30

minutes prior to the bid submission deadline, until the submission deadline. We then calculate

the “standing bid” of the dealer at time T , which is the dealer’s most recent bid as of time T . We

then calculate the diﬀerence between the dealer’s oﬃcial bid, and her standing bid at T minutes

prior to the deadline.

We then perform the same calculation for the customers, taking the diﬀerence between their

oﬃcial bid and their standing bids at T minutes prior to the bid submission deadline. Thus, for

a dealer who routes customer bids, the change in her information set between time T and the

auction deadline includes the modiﬁcations in customer bids.28

27Although we controlled for dealer ﬁxed eﬀects in Table 3, as we noted there, these ﬁxed eﬀects are constant

across auctions.

28The dealer may choose not to change her bid in response to a modiﬁcation in her customer’s bid. This choice

15

Dealers who do not route customer bids also make revisions to their bids. As the auction

deadline approaches, dealers may also respond to developments in the when-issued market; thus

dealers who do not observe customer bids may modify their bids in response to the when-issued

market. Since, by law, dealers have to report changes in their net long or short positions to

the Bank of Canada along with any changes to their bids, we observe net impact of this trading

activity through modiﬁcations to the dealers positions. Again, we code these modiﬁcations as the

diﬀerence between a dealer’s “standing” net position at T minutes prior to the deadline, and the

net position reported along with the dealer’s oﬃcial bid.

We run the following regression to test whether dealer bid revisions are correlated with cus-

tomer bid revisions:

∆DealerP QW

∆N etP osij
BidLimitij

+ β3

∆DealerQij
BidLimitij

+ β4

∆CustQij
BidLimitij

+ uj + γi + εij

(5)

This regression is essentially the ﬁrst-diﬀerenced (between T = 10 or T = 30 standing

bid and the oﬃcial bid) version of equation (4); with the additional feature that we control

for the bid revision activities of dealers who do not observe customer bids (the indicator vari-

able RoutesCustomerBids takes the value of 1 if dealer i routed customer bids in auction j).

BidLimitij does not enter into this regression since it does not vary across bid revisions.

Table 4 reports the results of the regression. The dependent variable in this table is the change

in a dealer’s bid during the last 10 or 30 minutes of an auction. Note that in both time intervals,

modiﬁcations in customer bids are positively correlated with modiﬁcations in dealer bids. For

the entire sample of auctions, the estimates indicate that a 1 cent increase in a customer’s bid

translates into a 0.24 cent increase in the dealer’s bid, if the change comes within the last 10

minutes. The response is somewhat less if the change comes within the last 30 minutes, and

indicates a 0.06 cent upward revision of the dealer bid in response to a 1 cent increase in the

customer’s bid. Note that from columns (2),(3),(5) and (6), we see that the correlation is much

more pronounced for bond auctions as opposed to T-bill auctions.

Another interesting result of this regression is that dealer bids respond asymmetrically to

changes in net position that come early vs. late. This we see from the reversal of the sign on the

dealer’s net position variable across T = 10 and T = 30. We do not have a very good explanation

for this ﬁnding, but one possibility is that the types of when-issued orders that a dealer receives

early in the bidding process are from a diﬀerent set of clientele than those who put in their when-

also has information about how dealers respond to customer bids. Hence, our data speciﬁcation also includes those

instances where the dealer does not change her bid in response to a customer bid modiﬁcation.

16

issued orders late in the bidding period. If we reconcile these results with the bid level regressions

in Table 2, however, we get the implication that most of the net position information is obtained

by the dealer earlier in the bidding period, and that changes within the last 10 minutes are rare

events, which appears to be the pattern in our data.

Controlling for the information contained in customer bids, are the bid revisions of dealers

who route customer bids any diﬀerent from bid revisions of dealers who do not route customer

bids? The coeﬃcient on RoutesCustomerBids in Table 4 suggests that the answer is “No” in

bond auctions, but “Yes” in T-bill auctions. Thus, it appears that in bond auctions, the “extra”

information source of dealers with customers is their customer bids. In T-bill auctions, however,

these dealers may be responding to another information source that we are not controlling for.

B. Dealer Proﬁtability and Access to Order Flow

Why is privately observed order ﬂow information important for dealers? One intuitive answer

to this question comes from a common value auction framework, in which the post-auction re-

sale/liquidation value of a given security, v, is common to all bidders, but a priori unknown. The

dealer has a prior belief about v, where the prior has mean µ and variance σ2

v. Suppose the dealer
also observes a private signal about the security value, x, which is distributed about the true value

of the security with mean zero error, i.e. x = v + εx, where ε is distributed with zero mean and
variance σ2

εx. If all of the aforementioned random variables are distributed normally, conditional

on her private information, the dealer expects the value of the security to be:

E(v|x) =

τv
τv + τεx

µ +

τεx
τv + τεx

x

(6)

where τv = 1
σ2
v

and τεx = 1
σ2
εx

, are the precisions of the prior and private signals respectively.

If the dealer receives another signal about the security’s true value, in the form of a customer

bid that she routes, for example, she will incorporate this information into her conditional expec-
tation.29 If we call this piece of information y, where y = v + εy, also distributed with mean zero

noise about the true security value, the conditional expectation becomes:

E(v|x, y) =

τv
τv + τεx + τεy

µ +

τεx
τv + τεx + τεy

x +

τεy
τv + τεx + τεy

y

(7)

i.e. a simple linear combination of the diﬀerent pieces of information that the bidder received,

weighted by their relative precisions. Furthermore, the variance of this conditional expectation as

an estimate of true value of the security, v, is lower when the dealer observes the additional piece

29We will say more about customers’ incentives to reduce the informational content of their bids in Section 4.

17

of information y, as opposed to when she does not. In particular, the variance of the estimator

declines with the number of independent additional signals that the dealer observes.

Seeing customer bids also gives the dealer a “strategic” advantage. To see this, consider the

very simple case where there is a single unit of the security being sold, and the customer is the

dealer’s only competitor in the auction. To abstract from the Bayesian updating mechanism

discussed above, assume also that both the customer and the dealer have independent private

valuations for the security (thus seeing the customer’s bid will not aﬀect the dealer’s valuation of

the security). Here, seeing the customer’s bid will allow the dealer to bid a very small increment

above the customer to win the auction in instances where winning is desirable for the dealer.

More generally, a dealer who sees customer bids has better information on the distribution of

competing bids (since customers are also competitors). Indeed, in the Appendix, we provide a

more general model based on a private value single-unit ﬁrst-price auction framework that has as

its main prediction that dealers who observe customer bids are, on average, more proﬁtable than

customers, and, in particular, dealers who do not observe customer bids.30

Despite the diﬀerent economic mechanisms at work, both explanations have the intuitive

prediction that dealers who observe more/better order-ﬂow information, whether in the form

of customer bids, or information ﬂows from the when-issued market, should be more proﬁtable

bidders. We now turn to empirical tests of this prediction.31

Figure 2 compares the bidding patterns of three classes of bidders: customers, dealers who

route customer bids, and dealers who do not route customer bids. Here, we plot the distribu-

tion of the diﬀerence of quantity-weighted price bids from the cutoﬀ-price. Since we plot the

distribution for the entire set of bids in our data, which encompasses securities of a wide vari-

ety of maturities, we normalized all of the deviations from the cutoﬀ prices using the formula

(cid:162)
(cid:161)
log(pbid) − log(pc)
, which converts the price diﬀerences reported in the data

10000(

360
Maturity

into the (negative) basis point diﬀerence of the annual yields implied by the prices.32

30Engelbrecht-Wiggans, Milgrom and Weber (1983) and Hendricks and Porter (1988) analyze common value

ﬁrst-price auctions with asymmetrically informed bidders. In their model, the informational advantage does not

stem from some bidders’ directly observing others’ information, but their model also has the intuitive result that

bidders who are better informed are on average more proﬁtable.

31One may also want to identify the relative importance of these two mechanisms separately, though we believe

that this exercise will entail detailed modelling of the strategic environment faced by the dealers, which we leave for

future research. Given that customer bids make up a small portion of bids, one may think that the value of obtaining

more information about resale/liquidation values may be larger than the value of the “strategic advantage” gained

by a dealer.

32The formula is based on a conversion of the prices in our bid data into the implied prices of a 360 day zero

coupon bond with the equivalent yield. To see this, suppose we have a zero coupon bond with face value PM paid

18

As is apparent from the ﬁgure, there are stark diﬀerences across these three classes of bidders.

Customers appear to bid the highest, followed by dealers who see customer bids. Dealers who do

not see customer bids appear to bid the lowest prices. Indeed, the density of bids submitted by

dealers who see customers appears to sandwiched between the density of customer bids and the

density of bids of dealers without customers – suggesting that dealers who see customer bids use a

combination of some “prior” information possessed by all dealers, and the “private” information

given by customer bids. Moreover, from this ﬁgure, it appears that dealers who observe customer

bids are able to place bids that have a tighter spread around the cutoﬀ price of the auction than

dealers who do not observe customer bids.

In particular, dealers who observe customer bids

appear to “underbid” less, and consequently win the auction more often.33

In Table 5, we regress this average prediction error measure on dealer characteristics, control-

ling for maturity class ﬁxed eﬀects. The ﬁrst dealer characteristic we focus on is the number of

customers served by the dealer over the auctions within the maturity class. The second dealer

characteristic is the “size” of a dealer’s operations, calculated as the (log) average size of the

quantity bids placed by the dealer for its own account across the auctions within a maturity class.

Table 5 reports a robust negative correlation between the number of customers served by a

dealer and the dealer’s prediction error. This correlation appears robust across diﬀerent subsam-

ples in the data. The point estimate from the ﬁrst column implies that each additional customer

served by a dealer is correlated with price bids that are 8 cents closer to the cutoﬀ price. Interest-

ingly, however, we ﬁnd a positive correlation between the dealer’s size and the absolute deviation

from the cut-oﬀ price.

In the second column, we introduce two more proxies for the amount of “order ﬂow informa-

tion” that the dealer has access to: the (absolute value of the) size of the dealer’s net position,

and the (total) size of customer bids that the dealer routes. One might expect that dealers who

are more active in the when-issued market, or those who route larger customer orders may have

learned more about the resale value of the security being auctioned, and hence will bid more

out M days from now. Then, if we see a bid of Pbid for this bond, the continuous compounding discount rate of the
bidder, rbid, implied by this price can be solved from the formula: Pbid = PM e−rbidM , or rbid = 1

). At

M log( PM
Pbid

this discount rate, the price that the bidder would pay for a 1 year zero coupon bond with face value P1yr would
have been P 1yr
bid = P1yre−360rbid . We can do the same to compute the daily discount rate implied by the cutoﬀ
price in the auction: rcutof f = 1
), and the price for a 1 yr zero coupon bond implied by this discount
rate P 1yr
Note that this is also equal to: log P 1yr

cutof f = P1yre−360rcutof f . Taking the log diﬀerence of these prices: log P 1yr
bid − log P 1yr

cutof f = −360(rbid − rcutof f ), the (negative) diﬀerence in the implied
annual zero-coupon bond yields. Since the magnitudes of this diﬀerence are on the order of one-one-hundredth of

M log( PM

).

a percent, i.e. “basis points,” we scale up by 10000 to get a (negative) basis point equivalent.

33Similar patterns were observable when we plotted the corresponding bid distributions for bond and bill auctions.

19

successfully. However, the regression shows only a weak negative correlation between net position

size and bid prediction error, and almost no correlation with customer size (though the number

of customers served is still negatively correlated with the bid prediction error). The result that

(total) customer bid size is not as important as the number of unique customer bids that a dealer

routes, seems consistent with the Bayesian updating hypothesis, where information from diﬀerent

sources is very important for improving forecasting accuracy. We should, however, be cautious

about interpreting the weak result regarding the importance of net positions – consistent with the

Bayesian updating hypothesis for customer bids size, the number of unique customer interactions

in the when-issued market (for which we do not have data) may well be more important than the

size of the net position.

In the third and fourth columns, we run the regression in the second column separately for

T-bill and bond auctions. The main result from these regressions is that “number of customers

served” is a more important driver of bidding performance in bond auctions than in T-bill auc-

tions. This ﬁnding is consistent with our earlier results that order ﬂow information appears more

important in bond vs. T-bill auctions.

The next set of results in Table 5 report the regressions for two alternative measures of dealer

bidding performance. The ﬁrst measure we utilize is the diﬀerence between the dealer’s (quantity-

weighted average price) bid and the cutoﬀ price in auctions where the dealer bids above the cutoﬀ

price, i.e. this is a measure of the amount of “overbidding.” 34 We note that the correlation

and explanatory power of the independent variables is low for this performance measure, except

in bond auctions, where larger dealers appear to “overbid” less, though dealers with larger net

positions appear to “overbid” more.35

The second measure we utilize is the diﬀerence between the dealer’s bid and the cutoﬀ price

in auctions where the dealer bids below the cutoﬀ price, i.e. a measure of the amount of “under-

bidding.” The results of the three regressions using this dependent variable are very similar to

those when we used absolute deviations as the measure of bidding performance.

Consistent with the patterns in Figure 2, these last two sets of results indicate that customer

information aids the dealer mostly through reducing the amount the dealer “underbids” in the

auction. Since, by underbidding, the dealer wins a lower quantity of the securities she was

demanding, this result suggests that customer information allows dealers to win more frequently.

“Overbidding,” on the other hand, indicates how much a dealer pays over the market-clearing

price for the quantity of securities he wins. Thus, our results show that dealers who serve a larger

20

number of customers consistently win a large fraction of the securities they were demanding, and

do not consistently overpay for the units they win. If dealers have similar willingness-to-pay for

the securities, this would indicate that dealers who see a larger number of customers are more

proﬁtable ex-post.

IV. Evidence for Strategic Response by Customers

So far we have considered only the dealer-side of the customer-dealer interaction. One might,

however, wonder whether customers recognize and react to the fact that dealers may utilize the

information from these interactions. We now describe and discuss the empirical evidence for

several possible customer responses.36

A. Customers Use Multiple Dealers

One potential strategic response by customers to counter dealers’ informational advantage is to

route their bids through multiple dealers. To test this hypothesis, for each customer in our sample,

we obtain the average number of dealers through whom she routes his bids in an auction.37 If this

average is less than 1.5, we deﬁne this customer as a “single-submitter” customer as he routes

bids through a single dealer in most but not all auctions in the sample. If this average is 1.5 or

more, then we classify this customer as a “multiple-submitter” customer. Table 6 indicates that

while “single-submitter” customers are in the majority, 24 (26 in bond auctions) customers in our

sample use multiple dealers.38

We now investigate why multiple-submitters are utilized. A ﬁrst hypothesis is that a customer

who needs to purchase a large amount of securities at the auction routes his bid through more

than one dealer. Column (1) of Table 7 reports the regression of the number of submitters utilized

by a customer on the proportion of this customer’s bid amount to the total issue amount in the

auction. Customers use an additional dealer to submit tenders for a 36% point increase in the

36The focus is primarily customer-dealer interactions in the primary market as our data does not allow us to

identify a customer and her individual transactions with a dealer in the when-issued market.

37The average is across the auctions in which the customer participates (we do this separately for bond and T-bill

auctions). Importantly, the number calculated here is not the average number of unique dealers utilized by the

customer over the sample. This is analyzed in Section 4.C.

38We should note that 82% of the “single submitter” customers participated in less than 20% of the auctions in

our data set, and can be regarded as “passive” customers; while only 48% of the “multiple submitter” customers

can be regarded as being “passive.” So, the relevant breakdown within “active” customers is that 13 distinct

customers are “multiple submitters,” whereas 17 distinct customers are “single-submitters,” i.e. the fraction of

active customers who are multiple submitters is much higher.

21

ratio of bid amount to issue amount.

An additional test is based on our previous observation that order ﬂow plays a more important

role in bond auctions than in treasury bill auctions. This should also aﬀect customers’ behavior:

the tendency to use a larger number of dealers in response to quantity demanded should be much

more pronounced for bonds than treasury bills. Thus, we rerun the regression in Column (1),

Table 7 by interacting the ratio of bid amount to issue amount with an indicator for bond auctions.

Results in Column (2), Table 7 show that this is the case. For bond auctions, customers use an

additional dealer to submit tenders for a smaller increase in the ratio of bid amount to issue

amount compared with treasury bill auctions, and the diﬀerence is statistically signiﬁcant.39 But

this result could also suggest that customers demand is higher in bonds relative to treasury bills,

and therefore it is the “submission limit” eﬀect that leads them to submit bids through multiple

dealers. We ﬁnd the reverse: the ratio of bid amount to issue amount is 10% higher for treasury

bills than bonds, and this diﬀerence is statistically signiﬁcant.

An alternative explanation to these ﬁndings is that customers may be routing bids through

several dealers to circumvent a dealer’s submission limit. As we explained in Section 2, a dealer

is subject to a maximum constraint on the amount he can submit for customers in an auction.

Thus, when customers have a large quantity of security to buy, they will tend to use multiple

dealers since a single dealer may not have enough capacity to route their bid.

However, there is some reason to believe that this alternative explanation does not fully ac-

count for the use of multiple dealers. In particular, we ﬁnd that not all customers use multiple

dealers; some use a single dealer. If the “submission limit” eﬀect was indeed the only driving

reason to using multiple dealers to submit one’s bids through, then controlling for the quantity

demanded by the customer, we should ﬁnd that the slope coeﬃcient of our regression in Ta-

ble 7, Column (1) should not be statistically diﬀerent between “single-submitter” and “multiple-

submitter customers,” as deﬁned in Table 6. Recall that the slope measures the average change

in the number of submitters used by a customer due to a change in the amount demanded by

this customer in an auction scaled by the issue amount in that auction. We actually ﬁnd the

reverse. We re-run the regression in Column (1) of Table 7 by interacting the ratio of bid amount

to issue amount with a dummy that equals 1 if the tender is submitted by a multiple-submitter

customer, and zero otherwise. The sample consists of oﬃcial tenders of customers in auctions

where they use two or more dealers as submitters. Column (3), Table 7 reports the results of this

39For bond auctions, the regression estimates mean that customers use an additional dealer to submit tenders

for a 24% increase in the ratio of bid amount to issue amount, and for treasury bill auctions they use an additional

dealer for a 40% increase in the ratio of the bid amount to issue amount.

22

regression. While multiple-submitter customers use an additional submitter for a 55% increase in

the proportion of bid amount to issue amount, single-submitter customers actually decrease the

number of submitters with an increase in the proportion of bid amount to issue amount, with

the diﬀerence being statistically signiﬁcant at the 99% level. These results suggest that while

single-submitter customers route bids through an additional dealer when the dealer hits his “sub-

mission” limit constraint, multiple-submitter customers route bids through several dealers due to

both the “submission limit” eﬀect and the strategic “demand concealing eﬀect.”

B. Long Term Dealer-Customer Relationships

The agency problem between customers and dealers may be resolved through contractual means.

Although we are not aware of explicit contracts written between customers and dealers, long-term

relationships may be an equally powerful remedy. Our data supports the existence of long-term

relationships. Table 8 lists the 7 customers we have identiﬁed as having long-term relationships

with their dealers. For example, customer A is a single-submitter customer who has a long-

term relationship with dealer 1 in treasury-bill auctions. Customer A participates in 25% of the

treasury bill auctions held in the sample period. In 78% of these treasury-bill auctions in which

customer A participates, she uses dealer 1 as the submitter.40

Absent any information on explicit or implicit agreements between customers and dealers, it is

diﬃcult to say too much about how these long-term relationships work. However, we can examine

our data to see if customers who are in long-term relationships bid diﬀerently than those who are

not. In Table 9, Columns (1) and (2), we look at the diﬀerence between the (quantity-weighted)

price bids of customers who are in long-term dealer relationships vs. those who are not. Column

(1) reports the results of a regression of the diﬀerence of quantity weighted average price and

the cutoﬀ price on the long-term dealer indicator. 41 Customers in long-term relationship, when

40To identify customers in long-term relationships with their dealers, we concentrated on customers in row 1 in

Table 6; we classiﬁed these customers as “single-submitter” customers. However, not all of these single-submitter

customers are active participants – in fact 82% participated in less than 20% of the auctions. When we eliminated

these “passive” customers, we ended up with 17 distinct active “single-submitter” customers in our sample. For

each of the single-submitter customers, we constructed the ratio of number of auctions in which a speciﬁc submitter

was used, to the total number of auctions in which the customer participated, for each distinct submitter used by

a single-submitter customer. This is referred to as a customer’s submitter proportion. For each customer, we tested

if the highest and second-highest submitter proportion is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Customers for whom this is the

case are customers with long-term relationship with a speciﬁc dealer in that they submit most of their tenders in

the sample period through a distinct dealer.

41To construct the sample for this regression, we remove all tenders submitted by the customer through the dealer

with whom he is not in a long-term relationship. This gives us allotted tenders of customers who are in long-term

23

submitting tenders through the dealer with whom they are in long-term relationship, bid 0.5 cents

more than customers who are not in long-term dealer relationship, and this diﬀerence is signiﬁcant

at the 99% level. In Column (2), Table 9 we run the same regression, but now introducing the

distinction between treasury bills and bond auctions. In both the treasury bill and bond sector,

customers in long-term relationship when they submit tenders through the dealer with whom

they are in long-term relationship, pay more compared with customers who are not in long-term

relationship. For bonds (treasury bills), the former pay 6 (5) cents more than the latter, and this

diﬀerence is statistically signiﬁcant.

Why do customers in long-term relationship pay a higher price for Government of Canada

securities when submitting tenders through the long-term dealer, compared with customers who

are not in a long-term relationship? Long-term customers and dealers interact with each other in

sectors other than Government of Canada securities. Thus, it is conceivable that the payoﬀs to

the long-term customers are being given in these sectors by the long-term dealer. Alternatively, it

is conceivable that a customer enters a long-term relationship with a dealer because institutional

reasons speciﬁc to a customer’s business push him to the inelastic part of his demand curve

relative to customers who are not in a long-term relationship.42 Indeed, there is some evidence

that although customers in long-term dealer relationships may be diﬀerent, they do beneﬁt from

established relationships. In column (3), we restrict attention to the winning bids of customers

who are in a long-term relationship, only in the sectors (T-bills or bonds) where there is a long

term relationship. These tenders could be submitted either through the dealer with whom the

customer is in a long term relationship, or through the dealer with whom the customer is not

in a long term relationship. The regression indicates that customers in a long-term relationship

pay 0.5 cents less when they submit tenders through their long-term dealer compared with other

dealers (the diﬀerence is signiﬁcant at the 89% level).

C. Last Minute Bidding by Customers

In Section 2.B we observed that while customer bids lag dealer bids, customer bids come quite

close to the submission deadline as well. A possible reason for late bidding by customers is that

customers are attempting to conceal their demand curves from dealers, to prevent them from

relationship, submitted through the dealer with whom they are in long-term relationship, in the sector in which

the customer is in a long-term relationship. As the control sample, we add allotted tenders submitted by customers

who are not in a long-term relationship in treasury bill and bond auctions.

42For example, a customer that is a pension fund could be legally required to hold a certain proportion of its

portfolio in the form of Government of Canada securities. This may not be the case for another customer that is a

hedge fund.

24

free-riding on their information. Since dealers are under legal obligation to route customer bids

as soon as they receive them, customers may try to bid very close to the deadline in order not

to leave enough time for dealers to revise their bids. Moreover, the tendency to delay interaction

with the dealer need not be conﬁned to the primary market. Customers may delay transacting

with dealers in the when-issued market to prevent a dealer from submitting a revised bid before

the bid submission deadline.43

To clarify this intuition, let [T − ∆, T ], ∆ > 0 denote the “last time interval” before the close

of the auction at time T .44 Suppose any bid transmitted within this time interval is accepted by

the BoC system with probability p < 1. In this situation, a customer who wants to lessen the

advantage possessed by her dealer can submit her bid exactly at time T − ∆. At this point, the

dealer can try to submit an updated bid, which is accepted with probability p. However, just in

case this updated bid is not accepted, the dealer can also place an “insurance” bid anytime before

T − ∆. Without any customer information, this “insurance” bid by the dealer will be equal to

the dealer’s optimal bid without access to customer information.

We now look at late tenders in our data set to investigate the plausibility of this hypothesis.

Throughout, late bids will refer to bids that were rejected by the issuer for being submitted after

the submission deadline. In case customers bid close to the bid submission deadline to prevent

dealers from revising their bids on seeing customer bids, we should ﬁnd that most of the late

bids are dealer bids, especially when compared with bids originating from dealers prior to the

bid submission deadline.45 We ﬁnd this to be the case: 77% of the late tenders are submitted

by primary dealers and 13% by customers,46 with only 48% of the oﬃcial bids originating from

dealers and 33% from customers. Moreover, we have ample evidence that late dealer tenders

are immediately preceded by dealer-customer interactions in both the primary and when-issued

markets,47 suggesting that last-minute when-issued trading and primary market bidding may

43We thank our referee for pointing out this possibility.
44If a bid is interpreted generically as a customer transaction with a dealer, this intuition can be extended to the

when-issued dealer-customer interactions as well.

45We thank a referee for pointing this out to us.
46The diﬀerence is statistically signiﬁcant at the 99% level.
4730% of late dealer tenders are preceded by a customer tender in the 5-minute interval prior to the late tender.

Another 20% of late dealer tenders report a “new” net position compared with the oﬃcial dealer bid immediately

preceding the late tender. The remaining 50% of the late dealer tenders are neither accompanied by a “new”

net position nor preceded by late tenders. But we do ﬁnd that these late tenders originate from dealers with no

customers in the auction where the late tender is submitted. In conjunction with the requirement by the Bank

of Canada to report net position changes only in excess of $25 million, this suggests that late bids from dealers

without customers are likely the result of customers delaying their transactions with dealers in the when-issued

market till just before the bid submission deadline.

25

indeed be a customer response.

We now show that late bids, if accepted, would have had an important impact on the auction

outcome. Since a dealer’s late bids are “informed” bids compared with the “insurance” bid placed

anytime before T − ∆, one would expect that if the late bids of dealers were accepted rather than

rejected, the auction outcome would be diﬀerent, in a manner that is more proﬁtable to the dealer.

To test this, we calculated the counterfactual auction cutoﬀ price and the resulting allocation had

the late bids been accepted. Notice that a late bid would aﬀect the cutoﬀ price or the allocation

only if it is marginal or inframarginal. We found that the late bid had an impact on the auction

outcome in 111 auctions where a late bid was received. However, these late bids had very little

eﬀect on the revenue of the seller – taking the late bids into account, the GoC would have received,

on average, only an additional 767 Canadian dollars per auction!48 This is also borne out by the

fact that the quantity weighted average price is really unchanged between the real auction and

the reallocated auction.49

These last set of ﬁndings imply that the late bids, when successful, are right at the margin, and

end up displacing other marginal bids (if the late bids had been at the top end of the aggregate

bid curve, i.e. if they had been inframarginal, we would have expected larger changes in revenue

and quantity-weighted average price). Moreover, within each of these 111 auctions, we ﬁnd that

there is a large amount of redistribution of the allocated securities. On average three dealers

are aﬀected in an auction, with the number of bidders who win more units in the reallocated

auction being almost equal to those who win less. In the auction where we observe the maximum

redistribution with the inclusion of late bids, one primary dealer ends up winning 398 million

Canadian dollars more of the auctioned security! Of course, this reallocation would have come at

the expense of other dealers – had this late bid been accepted in this auction, 3 other dealers would

have each won 100 million dollars less of the security. Moreover, the redistribution of rewards

is consistent with our intuitive prediction outlined in Section 3.C that more/better order-ﬂow is

proﬁtable for the dealer – the winning dealer’s late tender is immediately preceded by a customer

bid and when-issued trading, which is not the case for the three dealers who lose!50

48This amount is also not statistically signiﬁcant with Z=0.0002.
49The change in price, averaged across the 111 late auctions is 0.004 cents, and Z=1.2.
50The winning dealer’s late tender is accompanied by a change in his long position that is 25% lower than that

reported with his last accepted tender submitted 3 minutes before the bid submission deadline suggesting that he

shorts securities in the when-issued market in the last 3 minutes. In addition, the last accepted bid of this dealer

(submitted less than a minute before deadline) is one that he has routed for a customer. In contrast, two of the

three losing dealers do not route any customer bid in the auction, while the third dealer route’s a customer bid

only 10 seconds before the bid submission deadline circumventing this dealer from even submitting a late bid. We

also do not observe signiﬁcant net position changes for them.

26

V. Discussion and Conclusions

We conclude that in Government of Canada securities auctions, where direct access is restricted to

authorized security dealers, privately observed order-ﬂow information is an important and valuable

driver of bidding behavior, and thus the formation of asset prices. As we have demonstrated, the

importance of order-ﬂow information in this market manifests itself in a rich array of strategic

responses by both dealers and customers that are diﬃcult to reconcile through other means.

Given our empirical results so far, one may wonder whether the current market rules, which

provide an informational advantage to dealers, are undesirable from the point of view of achieving

economic objectives such as maximizing revenues or allocational eﬃciency. In the Appendix to

this paper, we use a simple, stylized model of the bidding environment to argue that, although the

current mechanism is likely to distort the eﬃciency of the allocation, its impact on revenues is likely

to depend sensitively on the particular economic environment. The main intuition underlying this

result is that the informational advantage possessed by (some) dealers introduces asymmetry into

the bidding strategies of (ex-ante symmetric) customers and dealers. This intuition follows from

the work of Maskin and Riley (2000), who have shown that asymmetric valuation structures in

ﬁrst-price auctions can lead to loss of eﬃciency, and ambiguous revenue rankings. What we show

through our modelling exercise is that a diﬀerent source of asymmetry, which comes from the

ability of some dealers to observe the information of others, leads to similar results.

The modelling exercise in the Appendix only considers the case where the source of infor-

mational advantage is “dissipated” by allowing direct access to customers to place bids in the

primary market. Another possibility is to impose some form of transparency obligations on the

authorized security dealers with respect to their secondary market activity. For example, in Italy,

the secondary market is transparent in that it is a centralized, regulated electronic screen-based

market. However, only authorized dealers are allowed to place bids in primary issuance. Still,

Drudi and Massa (2001) show how authorized dealers use the discrepancy in transparency to

obtain government securities in the less transparent primary market at below-market prices. In

the U.S., customers are allowed to place bids in the primary issuance, making the primary mar-

ket transparent. But unlike Italy, the secondary market is largely over-the-counter, with the

customer-dealer interaction protocol requiring the customer to reveal his intention to buy or sell

when he requests a quote. The Italian and the U.S. comparison, along with several other countries

examined by Sareen (2003), highlight that a mechanism for issuing government securities appears

to retain privacy of a security dealer’s “order-ﬂow” in at least one of the markets in which the

dealer is participating. Which one will be less costly for the issuer? Which one will increase

participation in the primary issuance? These questions will be explored in future research.

A. Appendix: Revenue and Eﬃciency Consequences of Current

Market Rules

We now analyze the simplest possible example where there is a single dealer, D, and her customer, C, who

are competing for a single unit of the security, and where both of these agents have symmetric indepen-
dent private valuations for the auctioned security.51 Both the dealer and the customer have symmetric,

independent private values drawn iid from the uniform [0, 1] distribution. However, as in the GoC auction

market, the dealer can observe the customer’s bid.

Call the customer’s valuation vc and her corresponding bid, bc. Similarly, call the dealer’s valuation

vd and her corresponding bid bd. The unique symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium of this game when the
dealer does not observe the customer’s bid is bd(v) = bc(v) = v
2 . When the dealer can see the customer’s
bid, the dealer will bid bd = bc + ε whenever vd > bc, where ε is a small increment to outbid the customer.

If vd < bc the dealer knows he does not want to win, so he can place any undominated bid (i.e. any bid

below vd).

Knowing the dealer’s strategy, the customer’s best response problem is to maximize:

max
bc

(vc − bc) Pr(bc > vd)

since the customer only wins the auction when bc > vd. Taking the ﬁrst-order condition, we get bc = vc
2 ,
i.e. the customer’s strategy is the same as in the case where the dealer does not beneﬁt from the customer.

Let us now see how the asymmetry between the dealer and the customer aﬀects the revenues to the

auctioneer. Since valuations are drawn iid uniform [0, 1], the expected revenue from the ﬁrst-price auction
without the dealer advantage is 1

3 , the expected value of the second highest valuation (by the revenue
equivalence theorem). When the dealer has informational advantage, however, the auctioneer’s revenue
is E[ vC
But with uniform [0, 1] valuations, the expected revenue will be 1

2 (disregarding the ε, which can be arbitrarily small).
4 , i.e. the auctioneer loses revenue from

2 ], since the winning bid will always equal vC

requiring customers to bid through dealers.

Moreover, the informational advantage given to the dealer introduces allocational ineﬃciency. Eﬃciency

requires that the good be allocated to the agent with the highest valuation. However, with the dealer-
customer arrangement, there exists cases where b∗

C < vD < vC i.e. cases where the dealer wins the auction

even though the customer has the higher valuation.

A. Two Dealers, One Customer

The second example we examine, however, shows that the revenue loss prediction is not robust (though

the eﬃciency loss prediction is). In this example, we introduce a second dealer to the model, with the twist

51In a common value framework, there would be an additional informational advantage to observing a customer’s

bid – the dealer could alleviate her winner’s curse by combining her own private information and the informative

content of her customer. Modelling the strategic interaction in a common value environment fully is much more

diﬃcult. Therefore, we will restrict attention to the private values environment. Note, however, that the private

value environment is able to generate many interesting predictions that we see in the data.

that this dealer does not have a customer whose bid she can observe (however, the bid of this dealer is not

observed by the other dealer). In this example, the “advantaged” dealer with the customer is once again

the most proﬁtable party, followed by the non-advantaged dealer, and ﬁnally by the customer. However,

the auctioneer’s revenue actually increases in this example.

This slightly more complicated setup is as follows: suppose, in addition to the dealer and customer,

there is another dealer in this auction, A, but this dealer does not have a customer. Let va be the (iid)

valuation draw of this dealer, and ba her corresponding bid.

In this case, D faces some uncertainty regarding her chances of winning the auction even upon seeing

the bid of C, since she still has to outbid A. Therefore, D’s expected proﬁt from winning the auction,

upon seeing bc is:

max
bd

(vd − bd) Pr(bd > ba|bd > bc)

if vd > bc

(8)

We now assume that A follows a linear strategy, ba = αva (we will verify this assumption later when

solving A’s problem). The optimal bidding strategy of D is given by:

bd =

vd + bc
2

> bc

if vd > bc

and any bid bd ≤ vd if vd < bc.

The optimal bidding problem of the customer is:

which is

max
bc

(vc − bc) Pr({bc > bd} ∩ {bc > ba})

max
bc

(vc − bc) Pr(bc > vd) Pr(bc > ba)

by independence and D’s bidding strategy above, and:

max
bc

(vc − bc)

b2
c
α

under the linear strategy assumption for A. Thus, the customer’s bidding function is given by:

bc =

2vc
3

which is the Bayesian Nash strategy with 3 symmetric bidders.

Finally, A’s optimal bidding problem is given by:

max
ba

(va − ba) Pr(ba > max{

2vc
3

,

vc
3

+

vd
2

})

when we substitute in D and C’s strategies. Graphical inspection yields:

Pr(ba > max{

2vc
3

,

vc
3

+

vd
2

}) =

9b2
a
4

and A’s optimal bidding strategy can be solved to be:

ba =

2va
3

which is once again the Bayesian Nash strategy with 3 symmetric bidders. Notice that in this last step,

we did not impose the linearity of A’s bid function, hence we have veriﬁed the linearity assumption made

in the earlier steps.

The fact that the customer C and customer-less dealer A have the same bidding strategies may appear
counterintuitive at ﬁrst; however, these strategies are not outcome equivalent (since D acts upon C’s bid).
Moreover, it appears that D beneﬁts the most from this arrangement. A and C are at a disadvantage com-
pared to the setting with 3 symmetric bidders, with C being the most disadvantaged party. In particular,
our Monte Carlo simulations (with 1,000,000 draws of iid bidder valuations) show that D wins the auction
45% of the time, A wins the auction 33% of the time, and C wins the auction 22% of the time (instead
of each winning with probability 1
3 ). D’s expected proﬁt is 0.0868 compared to 0.0833 in the symmetric
case, A’s proﬁt is 0.0810, and C’s proﬁt is 0.056. Interestingly, the auctioneer appears to gain slightly from
this arrangement in terms of revenues: the expected revenue is 0.5089, compared to 0.5 in the 3 symmetric
bidders case. However, this revenue gain is a result of an eﬃciency loss, which happens when D wins the
auction in instances where C had the highest valuation.

This table documents the dispersion of bids submitted at different time intervals. The dependent variables are (a) the absolute dispersion of (quantity-weighted) 
price  bids  around  the  market  clearing  price,  and  (b)  the  standard  deviation  of  price  bids  that  are  submitted  within  a  given  time  interval.  (Thus,  the  unit  of 
observation is auction/time-interval). As independent variables, we include indicators for 5 minute time-intervals, with bids submitted earlier than 30 minutes to 
the  deadline  as  the  excluded  group. We  also  control  for bid volume  in  the  time  interval,  and  include  auction  fixed effects  to  isolate  within  auction variation. 
Standard errors are reported below the coefficients. Significance at 10-percent, 5-percent and 1-percent levels are denoted by (*),(**), and (***).

Table 2 (a):  Comparison of the Timing of Dealer vs. Customer Bids 
“Submission  time  of  dealer  bid”  reports  the  time,  in  minutes,  before  the  auction  deadline  at  which  the  average  official  dealer  bid  is  submitted.  The  standard 
deviation is reported in parantheses below. “Submission time of Customer Bid” measures the time, in minutes, before the auction deadline at which the official 
customer bid is submitted. The “paired-difference” is the result of a pairwise t-test between the bid submission time of a dealer and a customer she serves. We 
report the p-value and standard errors for this test below. (***) indicates significance at the 1% level.

Table 2 (b):  Comparison of Bid Submission Timing of Customers, Dealers without Customers, and Dealer with Customers 
The regressions reported in this table analyze the timing of all official, competitive bids. The dependent variable in the regressions is the time, in minutes, before 
the auction deadline at which an official bid is submitted. We categorize each official bid as being (i) the “personal” bid of a dealer who routes customer bids, (ii) 
the “personal” bid of a dealer who does not route customer bids, and (iii) a customer bid. The first category is excluded from the regression. We control for bid 
size and auction fixed effects.

Table 3: Do Customer Bids Drive Variation Across Dealers' Bids? 
Each  column  reports  the  estimated  coefficients  from  a  regression  in  which  the  dependent  variable  is  the  difference  between  the  dealer's  official  (quantity 
weighted average price) bid and the cut-off price of the auction. The first independent variable is the difference between this dealer's customers’ bids (averaged 
over customers if the dealer has multiple customers) and the cut-off price of the auction – these bids are observed by the dealer prior to submitting her official 
bid. We also control for the dealers’ net positions, their maximum submission limits, and how much of this submission limit they are using for their own bids vs. 
customer bids, as declared in their official tenders. To purge the effect of the public information content in dealer and customer bids, we control for auction and 
maturity-level fixed effects; thus our estimates reflect within-auction variation across dealers. In the right hand panel, we also control for dealer-fixed effects to 
control for systematic differences in dealers’ bidding behavior. Standard errors are reported below the coefficients. Significance at 10-percent, 5-percent and 1-
percent levels are denoted by (*),(**), and (***).

Table 4: Do Modifications in Customer Bids Drive Modifications in Dealer Bids? 
Each column reports the estimated coefficients from a regression in which the dependent variable is the change in a dealer's quantity weighted average bid price 
within the last 10 or 30 minutes before the bid submission deadline. The sample pools modifications in the bids of two types of dealers: those who route customer 
bids, and those who do not, which is coded in the first independent variable. The second independent variable interacts with this indicator the change in this 
dealer's customers' bid prices during the last 10 or 30 minutes in the auction. The rest independent variable is the change in the dealer's reported net position, bid 
size and customer’s bid size during the last 10 or 30 minutes of the auction. To purge the effect of public information sources in comovements across customer 
and dealer bid changes, we control for auction and maturity level fixed effects in the regressions. We also control for dealer fixed-effects in all specifications. 
Standard errors are reported below the coefficients. Significance at 10-percent, 5-percent and 1-percent levels are denoted by (*),(**), and (***).

Table 5: Access to Customers and Dealers’ Bidding Performance 
The dependent variable in the first three columns is computed by first calculating the absolute deviation of a dealer’s (quantity-weighted average) price bid from 
an  auction’s  cutoff  price.  This  absolute  deviation  is  then  average  across  securities  auctions  within  a  maturity  class  that  the  dealer  participated  in.  The  first 
independent variable is the average number of customers served by a dealer across auctions within the maturity class. Next, we control for the log of the dealer’s 
size,  measured  by  the  amount  of  securities  demanded  by  the  bidder  across  auctions  within  the  maturity  class.  We  also  control  for  the  absolute  value  of  the 
dealer’s net position across these auctions, and the size of customer bids. The coefficients reported are from an OLS regression at the dealer and maturity level, 
where we also controlled for maturity fixed effects. Standard errors are reported in parentheses and significance at 10-percent, 5-percent and 1-percent levels are 
denoted by (*),(**), and (***). The dependent variable in the next three columns is a measure of the amount of “overbidding” by the dealer. This variable is set 
equal to the difference between the dealer’s bid and the auction’s cutoff price when the dealer’s bid exceeds the cutoff price. It is set equal to zero in auctions 
where the dealer’s bid is below the cutoff price. The variable is then averaged across auctions within a maturity class. The dependent variable for the last three 
columns of the table is a measure of the amount of “underbidding” by the dealer. This variable is set equal to the difference between the dealer’s bid and the 
auction’s cutoff price when the dealer’s bid is below the cutoff price. It is set equal to zero in auctions where the dealer’s bid is above the cutoff price.

Table 6: Frequency Distribution of Customers in terms of Average Number of Submitters 
The numbers reported in the table are obtained as follows. Suppose customer ABC participates in 30 year bond auctions, and 1 year treasury bill auctions in the 
sample. We obtain the average number of submitters used by this customer in the 30 year bond auction and the 1 year treasury bill auction. Suppose this average 
3 for the former and 1.25 for the latter auctions. Then customer ABC will appear in row (1) under the ''Treasury Bill'' column, and row (3) under the ''Bonds'' 
column. He is a multiple-submitter customer in bond auctions, and a single-submitter customer in treasury bill auctions.

Table 7: Customers Use Multiple Dealers 
The dependent variable in the reported regressions is the number of submitters used by a customer in an auction. “Bid amount/Issue Amount” is the ratio of the 
total amount bid by a customer in an auction over the amount issued in the auction. “Multiple-Submitter” is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the 
customer is a multiple-submitter in an auction, and zero otherwise. The sample in columns (1)-(2) consists of official tenders of all customers. The sample in 
column  (3)  consists  of  official  tenders  of  all  customers  in  auctions  where  they  submit  tenders  through  two  or  more  dealers.  Standard  errors  are  given  in 
parentheses, (***) significant at 99%; (**) significant at 95%.

Table 9: Bidding Behavior of Customers with Long Term Dealer Relationships 
The dependent variable in the reported regression is the difference in the quantity weighted average price of an allotted tender (winning bid) and the cutoff price 
in Canadian dollars. Both the quantity weighted average price and the cutoff price are quoted in terms of $CD 100 of the security allotted. The sample for the 
regressions  is  made  up  of  allotted  tenders  of  customers  who  are  in  a  long-term  relationship,  submitted  through  the  dealer  with  whom  they  are  in  long-term 
relationship, in the sector in which the customer is in a long-term relationship. As a control group, we also include allotted tenders submitted by customers who 
are not in a long-term relationship. “Use long-term dealer’’ takes the value 1 if a customer in a long-term relationship submits the tender through the long-term 
dealer in the sector where there is a long-term relationship, and 0 otherwise.  “Bond auction” is a dummy variable that takes value if the auction is a bond auction 
and zero in treasury bill auctions. Standard errors are in parentheses above the double lines. (***) denotes significance at 99%.
