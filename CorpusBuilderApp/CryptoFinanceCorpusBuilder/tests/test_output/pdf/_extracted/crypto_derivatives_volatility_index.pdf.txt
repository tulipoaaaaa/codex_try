J.P. Morgan Strategic Volatility Index  
OVERVIEW  
The J.P. Morgan  Strategic  Volatility  Index   (the 
“Index”  or “Strat  Vol Index”)  provides  long exposure  
to VIX futures  at the 2-month  point,  and aims  to 
offset  and potentially  profit  from the “negative  roll 
yield”1 often  associated  with a long VIX futures  
position  by activating  a short  position  in VIX futures  
at the 1-month  point  during  certain  market  
conditions . The Index  is rules -based,  with daily 
levels  published  to Bloomberg  under  the ticker  
JPUSSTVL .  
How the Index Works  
Maintains  long exposure  to the 2-month  point  on the VIX 
futures  curve .  
An opportunistic  short  position  at the 1-month  point  on the 
VIX futures  curve  is activated  during  certain  market  
scenarios  (as described  below),   which  aims  to offset  and 
potentially  profit  from the negative  roll yield associated  with 
the VIX curve  in those  market  conditions . 
When  activated,  the short  position  is increased  in 20% 
daily increments ; when  de-activated  it is decreased  in 20% 
daily decrements . The short  position  ranges  from 0% to 
100%. 
Activation/De -activation  signal :  If the level of the VIX 
Index  is below  the 1-month  point  on the VIX futures  curve  
(as would  typically  be the case  when  the curve  is in 
contango)  for 3 consecutive  days,  the short  position  is 
activated  (in 20% increments)  and if it is above  the 1-
month  point  on the VIX futures  curve  for 3 consecutive  
days,  the short  position  is de-activated  (in 20% 
decrements) .  
The Index  level incorporates  a 0.75% per annum  index  
fee, as well as additional  deductions  related  to the notional  
rebalancing  of the VIX futures  contracts3 Brief Background on Volatility Investing  
The VIX Index,  published  by the Chicago  Board  of Options  
Exchange  (“CBOE”),  is viewed  as the benchmark  index  for 
measuring  the market’s  expectation  of the near-term (30 
days)  volatility  of the S&P 500®  Index .  
Volatility,  as measured  by the VIX Index,  has historically  
increased  during  periods  of decline  in the equity  markets .  
(See  the chart  below .)  However,  the VIX Index  is not an 
investable  index . 
Futures  contracts  on the VIX Index  were  introduced  by the 
CBOE  in 2004  to provide  investable  access  to volatility . 
The VIX futures  curve  is often  in “contango”2 which  can, all 
else being  equal,  result  in negative  returns  for a strategy  
that is long VIX futures . Hypothetical historical performance comparison: Strategic

3. The level of the Index  incorporates  the daily deduction  of (a) the index  fee of 0.75% per annum  and (b) a “daily  rebalancing  adjustment  amount”  that is 
determined  by applying  a rebalancing  adjustment  factor  of between  0.20% and 0.50% per day, both to the aggregate  notional  amount  of each  of the VIX 
futures  contracts  hypothetically  traded  that day and the amount  of the change,  if any, in the level of the exposure  to the synthetic  short  position . Please

adjustments  
The reported  level of the Index  incorporates  the daily 
deduction  of (a) an index  fee of 0.75% per annum  and (b) a 
“daily  rebalancing  adjustment  amount”  that is determined  by 
applying  a rebalancing  adjustment  factor  of between  0.20% 
and 0.50% per day, both to the aggregate  notional  amount  
of each  of the VIX futures  contracts  hypothetically  traded  
that day and the amount  of the change,  if any, in the level of 
the exposure  to the synthetic  short  position .  
The daily rebalancing  adjustment  amount  is intended  to 
approximate  the “slippage  costs”  that would  be experienced  
by a professional  investor  seeking  to replicate  the 
hypothetical  portfolio  contemplated  by the Index  at prices  
that approximate  the official  settlement  prices  (which  are not 
generally  tradable)  of the relevant  VIX futures  contracts .   
These  risk factors  are not exhaustive . Please  review  the 
relevant  product  supplement  we have  filed and any relevant  
term  sheet  or pricing  supplement  for further  information  on 
risk factors  associated  with the J.P. Morgan  Strategic  
Volatility  Index .    “contango”  is used  to describe  the shape  of a futures  curve  
when  the price  of a futures  contract  with a later expiration  is 
higher  than that of a futures  contract  with an earlier  expiration .  
 “backwardation”  is the opposite  of contango  and is used  to 
describe  the shape  of a futures  curve  when  the price  of a futures  
contract  with a later expiration  is lower  than the price  of a futures  
contract  with an earlier  expiration . 
“negative  roll yield”  / “positive  roll yield” : Because  futures  
contracts  have  specific  expiration  dates,  in order  for an investor  
to maintain  exposure,  the investor  needs  to sell a futures  
contracts  as it gets close  to expiration  and purchase  another  
contract  with a later expiration  date.  This process  is known  as 
“rolling”  the futures  position .  When  a futures  curve  is in 
“contango”  (see above),  all else being  equal,  an investor  in a 
long futures  position  pays  a higher  price  to buy a later expiration  
futures  contract  than the price  at which  the investor  sells the 
contract  as it nears  expiration,  thus suffering  negative  returns  
(“negative  roll yield”) .   Whereas  when  the futures  curve  is in 
“backwardation”  (see above),  all else being  equal,  an investor  in 
a long futures  position  pays  a lower  price  to buy a later expiration  
futures  contract  than the price  at which  the investor  sells the 
contract  as it nears  expiration  thus generating  positive  returns  
(“positive  roll yield”) . Glossary of Select Terms Hypothetical historical illustration of the exposure to the short component of the Strategic Volatility Index:

What are the main risks in the Index?  
Any securities  we may issue  linked  to the Index  may result  
in a loss, and are exposed  to the credit  risk of J.P. Morgan  
Chase  & Co. 
The Index  has limited  operating  history .  
The reported  level of the Index  incorporates  the daily 
deduction  of (a) an index  fee of 0.75% per annum  and (b) a 
“daily  rebalancing  adjustment  amount”  (as described  
above) . 
The daily rebalancing  adjustment  amount  is likely  to have  a 
substantial  adverse  effect  on the level of the Index . 
The Index  may not be successful  and may not outperform  
any alternative  strategy . 
Strategies  that provide  exposure  to equity  volatility,  which  
are subject  to significant  fluctuations,  are not suitable  for all 
investors .  
When  the synthetic  short  position  is activated,  your return  
on the notes  is dependent  on the net performance,  not the 
absolute  performance,  of the long and short  positions .  
Due to the time lag inherent  in the Index,  the exposure  to 
the synthetic  short  position  may not be adjusted  quickly  
enough  to offset  loss or generate  profit . 
The Index  comprises  only notional  assets  and liabilities .  
The Index  is an excess  return  index  and reflects  the 
performance  of an uncollateralized  investment  in futures  
contracts . 
Our affiliate,  J.P. Morgan  Securities  Ltd. (“JPMSL”),  is the 
Sponsor  and Calculation  Agent  for the Index  and may 
adjust  the Index  in a way that affects  its level.  
The Index  is subject  to risks associated  with futures  
contracts .
