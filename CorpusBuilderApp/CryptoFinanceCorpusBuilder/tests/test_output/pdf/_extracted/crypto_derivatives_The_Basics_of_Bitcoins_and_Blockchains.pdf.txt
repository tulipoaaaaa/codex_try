INTRODUCTION
SOME DEFINITIONS
Bitcoin,	blockchains,	and	cryptocurrencies	are	fascinating	to	me
because	there	are	so	many	elements	to	understand.	This
multidisciplinary	nature	is	one	of	the	reasons	I,	and	so	many	others,
love	the	industry—it	is	easy	to	get	sucked	into	the	rabbit	hole,	and	as	you
try	to	understand	each	element,	every	answer	begets	more	questions.
The	journey	starts	with	‘What	is	Bitcoin?’	but	the	explanations	and
answers	come	from	the	disciplines	of	economics,	law,	computer	science,
finance,	civil	society,	history,	geopolitics,	and	more.	You	could	create	a
pretty	comprehensive	high	school	curriculum	around	Bitcoin	and	have
plenty	of	material	to
	
spare.
And	this	is	the	very	reason	why	it	is	so	hard	to	explain.	This	book	is	an
attempt	to	cover	the	basics.	It	is	aimed	at	the	thinking	person	but
assumes	that	the	reader	doesn’t	have	a	detailed	background	in	the
various	disciplines	mentioned	previously.	Different	people	will	find
different	parts	interesting.	I	try	to	use	analogies	where	I	think	they	help
explain	some	concepts,	but	be	gentle	with	me:	all	analogies	break	down	if
stretched	too	far.	And	although	I	have	tried	to	be	accurate,	there	will	still
be	oversimplifications,	errors	and	omissions.	What	is	true	today	may	not
be	tomorrow:	the	pace	of	change	is	rapid.	I	am	the	first	to	admit	that
there	are	limits	to	my	own	technical	expertise.	Nevertheless,	I	hope	that
every	reader	comes	away	learning	something	new.
With	that,	let’s	start	by	defining	at	a	basic	level	some	of	the	words	and
concepts	we	will	be	exploring	later	in	the	book.
Bitcoin
1
	and	Ether	are	two	of	the	better-known	
cryptocurrencies
	or	
coins
(note	that	the	coin	on	the	Ethereum	network	is	called	Ether,	though	is
often	misnamed	in	the	media	as	‘Ethereum’).	These	are	
assets
	or	items	of
value	that	exist	digitally,	not	physically,	and	are	created	by	software.	They
have	no	issuer	as	such.	No	person,	company,	or	entity	backs	these,	and
there	are	no	terms	of	service	or	guarantees	associated	with	them.	Like
physical	gold,	cryptocurrencies	simply	exist,	and	are	created	or	destroyed
according	to	the	rules	articulated	in	the	code	that	creates	and	governs
them.	If	you	own	some	cryptocurrency,	and	we’ll	see	what	that	actually
means	later,	it	is	your	asset	that	you	control.	It	has	value,	and	can	be
exchanged	for	other	cryptocurrencies,	US	dollars,	or	other	global
sovereign	(or	fiat)	currencies.	Its	value	is	determined	within	marketplaces
called	
exchanges
	where	buyers	and	sellers	come	together	to	trade	at
mutually	agreed	prices.
As	well	as	‘coins,’	units	of	cryptocurrencies	may	be	described	as	digital
assets.	That	is,	unique	data	items	whose	ownership	can	be	passed	from
account	to	account.	These	accounts	are	technically	called	addresses,	and
we	will	explore	what	addresses	are	later.	When	these	digital	assets	move
from	one	account	to	another	they	are	all	recorded	on	their	respective
transaction	databases	known,	because	of	some	unique	shared
characteristics	which	we	will	look	into	later,	as	blockchains.
Just	to	confuse	everybody,	some	digital	assets	are	described	as	tokens,	as
in	‘Is	it	a	cryptocurrency	or	a	token?’.	Cryptocurrencies	and	tokens	are
both	types	of	cryptographically	secured	digital	assets,	sometimes	known
as	
cryptoassets
.	These	tokens	have	different	characteristics	from
cryptocurrencies	and	from	each	other.	Tokens	can	be	fungible	(one	token
being	more	or	less	replaceable	by	another),	or	non-fungible	(where	each
token	represents	something	unique).	Unlike	cryptocurrencies,	these
newer	tokens	are	usually	issued	by	known	issuers	who	stand	behind
them,	and	the	tokens	can	represent	legal	agreements	(like	financial
assets),	physical	assets	(like	gold),	or	future	access	to	products	and
services.
Where	the	underlying	item	is	an	asset	you	could	think	of	the	token	as	a
digital	version	of	a	cloakroom	ticket,	issued	by	a	cloakroom	clerk	and
redeemable	for	your	coat.	Indeed,	these	tokens	are	sometimes	called
DDRs—Digital	Depository	Receipts.	Where	the	underlying	item	is	an
agreement,	product	or	service,	you	can	think	of	the	token	as	something
like	a	concert	ticket	issued	by	a	concert	organiser	and	redeemable	for
entry	to	a	concert	at	a	later	date.
To	give	some	real	examples,	there	are	tokens	that	represent	everything
from	gold	bullion	sitting	in	a	vault	somewhere
2
,	through	to	tokens
representing	unique	‘CryptoKitties’—collectable	digital	cats	with	specific
visual	attributes	determined	by	their	‘DNA’	code.
A CryptoKitty

What	do	all	of	these	coins	and	tokens	have	in	common?	All	transactions
related	to	them,	including	their	creation,	destruction,	changes	of
ownership,	and	other	logic	or	future	obligations,	are	recorded	on
blockchains
:	replicated	databases	that	act	as	the	ultimate	books	and
records—the	‘golden	source’	that	represents	the	universal	understanding
of	the	current	status	of	all	units	of	the	digital	asset.
Bitcoin’s	blockchain	is	an	ever-growing	list	of	every	Bitcoin	transaction
that	has	ever	happened,	right	from	the	creation	of	the	very	first	Bitcoin	on
3	January	2009,	through	to	the	most	recent	transfer	or	payment	from
one	account	to	another.	Ethereum’s	blockchain	is	a	list	of	transactions
involving	the	cryptocurrency	Ether,	a	multitude	of	other	tokens
(including	those	representing	CryptoKitties)	and	other	related	data,	all	of
which	is	recorded	on	Ethereum.
Different	blockchains	have	different	characteristics,	so	much	so	that
nowadays	it	is	almost	impossible	to	make	a	general	statement	about
‘blockchain’	without	being	wrong	for	some	particular	example.	Some
blockchains,	like	the	well-known	Bitcoin	and	Ethereum	chains,	are
public
,	or	
permissionless
,	meaning	that	their	list	of	transactions	can	be
written	to	by	anyone,	with	no	gatekeepers	to	approve	or	reject	parties
who	want	to	create	blocks	or	participate	in	bookkeeping.	Self-
identification	is	not	a	requirement	to	create	blocks	or	validate
transactions.	Other	blockchains	can	be	
private
	or	
permissioned
,	in	that
there	is	a	controlling	party	who	allows	participants	to	read	or	write	to
them.
And	finally,	we	need	to	distinguish	between	
protocols
,	
code
,	
software
,
transaction
	
data
,	
coins
,	and	
blockchains
.	Bitcoin	is	a	bunch	of	
protocols
:
rules	that	define	and	characterise	Bitcoin	itself—what	it	is,	how
ownership	is	represented	and	recorded,	what	constitutes	a	valid
transaction,	how	new	participants	can	join	the	network	of	operators,	how
participants	should	behave	if	they	want	to	be	kept	up	to	date	with	the
latest	transactions,	and	so	on.	These	protocols,	or	rules,	can	be	described
in	English	or	any	other	human	language,	but	are	best	articulated	in
computer	
code
,	which	in	turn	can	be	compiled	into	
software
—Bitcoin
software—that	enacts	those	protocols,	
i.e.
	makes	them	operate.	When	the
software	is	run,	Bitcoin	
coins
	are	generated	and	can	be	sent	from	one
account	to	another.	These	actions	are	recorded	as	
transaction	data
,	and
this	transaction	data	is	bundled	into	bundles	or	
blocks
,	and	linked
together	to	form	the	Bitcoin	
blockchain
.
So,	to	recap,	Bitcoin	
protocols
	are	written	out	as	Bitcoin	
code
	which	is
run	as	Bitcoin	
software
	which	creates	Bitcoin	
transactions
	containing
data	about	Bitcoin	
coins
	recorded	on	Bitcoin’s	
blockchain
.	Got	it?	Good.
Not	all	other	cryptocurrencies	or	tokens	work	this	way,	but	it	is	as	good	a
basis	as	any	to	start	the	journey.
Some	people	think	of	Bitcoin	as	the	next	evolution	of	money—it	is
described	as	a	(crypto)	
currency
	after	all.	So	we	need	to	understand	a
little	more	about	money.	What	is	money?	Has	it	always	been	the	same?
How	successful	has	money	been?	Are	some	forms	of	money	better	than
others?	Can	the	nature	of	money	ever	change,	or	is	what	we	have	going	to
be	the	same	for	evermore?	Do	cryptocurrencies	sit	easily	alongside
today’s	money,	fulfilling	a	niche	or	purpose	that	existing	forms	of	money
cannot	serve,	or	are	cryptocurrencies	competitors	to	today’s	money	that
threaten	the	status	quo	of	state-issued	currency?
This	book	should	give	you	a	good	well-rounded	education	into	the	basics
of	bitcoins	and	blockchains	and	assumes	no	specific	starting	expertise.
We	start	by	defining	and	understanding	the	nature	of	money.	Then	we
dive	into	digital	money	and	how	value	is	really	transferred	around	the
world.	We	then	explore	a	few	key	concepts	from	a	branch	of	mathematics
called	cryptography,	so	that	we	can	then	move	to	cryptocurrencies
themselves.	In	the	cryptocurrencies	section,	we	dive	into	the	Bitcoin	and
Ethereum	networks,	and	the	Bitcoin	and	Ether	digital	tokens—what	they
are,	how	to	buy,	store,	and	sell	them,	how	to	explore	their	blockchains,
and	the	risks	in	managing	them,	including	the	unique	challenges	in
moving	this	new	digital	money	around	the	world.	Finally,	we	discuss	the
types	of	blockchain	technology	that	are	being	explored	by	banks	and	big
businesses	to	join	up	their	databases	and	do	more	efficient	business.
Although	I	have	my	personal	biases	and	interests,	throughout	the	book	I
try	to	maintain	a	neutral	position	on	the	cryptocurrencies,	tokens,	and
blockchain	platforms.	I	try	not	to	neither	over-sell	them	nor	be	overly
critical.	I	leave	it	up	to	readers	to	conclude	for	themselves	whether	these
technologies	are	a	trend	or	a	fad,	useful	or	useless,	good	or	bad.


Part 1
MONEY
PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL MONEY
Cash—physical	money—is	wonderful.	You	can	transfer	(or	spend	or	give
away)	as	much	of	what	you	have	as	you	want,	when	you	want,	without
any	third	parties	approving	or	censoring	the	transaction	or	taking	a
commission	for	the	privilege.	Cash	doesn’t	betray	valuable	identity
information	that	can	be	stolen	or	misused.	When	you	receive	cash	in	your
hand,	you	know	that	the	payment	can’t	be	‘undone’	(or	charged	back,	in
industry	jargon)	at	a	later	date,	unlike	digital	transactions	such	as	credit
card	payments	and	some	bank	transfers,	which	is	a	pain	point	for
merchants.	Under	normal	circumstances,	once	you	have	cash,	it	is	yours,
it	is	under	your	control,	and	you	can	transfer	it	again	immediately	to
somebody	else.	The	transfer	of	physical	money	immediately	extinguishes
a	financial	obligation	and	leaves	nobody	waiting	for	anything	else.
But	there	is	a	big	problem	with	traditional	physical	cash:	it	doesn’t	work
at	a	distance.	Unless	you	carry	it	in	person,	you	can’t	transfer	physical
cash	to	someone	on	the	other	side	of	the	room,	let	alone	on	the	other	side
of	the	planet.	This	is	where	digital	money	becomes	highly	useful.
Digital	money	differs	from	physical	money	in	that	it	relies	on
bookkeepers	who	are	trusted	by	their	customers	to	keep	accurate
accounts	of	balances	they	hold.	To	put	it	another	way,	you	can’t	own	and
directly	control	digital	money	yourself	(well,	you	couldn’t	until	Bitcoin
came	along,	but	more	on	that	later).	To	own	digital	money,	you	must
open	an	account	somewhere	with	someone	else—a	bank,	PayPal,	an	e-
wallet.	The	‘someone	else’	is	a	third	party	whom	you	trust	to	keep	books
and	records	of	how	much	money	you	have	with	them—or,	more
specifically,	how	much	they	must	pay	you	on	demand	or	transfer	to
someone	else	at	your	request.	Your	account	with	a	third	party	is	a	record
of	an	agreement	of	trust	between	you:	simultaneously	how	much	you
of	an	agreement	of	trust	between	you:	simultaneously	how	much	you
have	with	them,	and	how	much	they	owe	you.
Without	the	third	party,	you	would	need	to	keep	bilateral	records	of	debts
with	everyone,	even	people	who	you	may	not	trust	or	who	may	not	trust
you,	and	this	is	not	feasible.	For	example,	if	you	bought	something	online,
you	could	attempt	to	send	the	merchant	an	email	saying	‘I	owe	you	$50,
so	let’s	both	record	this	debt’.	But	the	merchant	probably	wouldn’t	accept
this;	firstly,	because	they	probably	have	no	reason	to	trust	you,	and
secondly,	because	your	email	is	not	very	useful	to	the	merchant—they
can’t	use	your	email	to	pay	their	staff	or	suppliers.
Instead,	you	instruct	your	bank	to	pay	the	merchant,	and	your	bank	does
this	by	reducing	how	much	your	bank	owes	you,	and,	at	the	other	end,
increasing	how	much	the	merchant’s	bank	owes	them.	From	the
merchant’s	point	of	view,	this	extinguishes	your	debt	to	the	merchant,
and	replaces	it	with	a	debt	from	their	bank.	The	merchant	is	happy,	as
they	trust	their	bank	(well,	more	than	they	trust	you),	and	they	can	use
the	balance	in	their	bank	account	to	do	other	useful	things.
Unlike	cash,	which	settles	using	the	transfer	of	physical	tokens,	digital
money	settles	by	increasing	and	decreasing	balances	in	accounts	held	by
trusted	intermediaries.	This	probably	seems	obvious,	though	you	may	not
have	thought	of	it	this	way.	We’ll	come	back	to	this	later,	as	bitcoins	are	a
form	of	digital	money	which	share	some	properties	of	physical	cash.
There	is	a	big	difference	between	
online
	card	payments,	where	you	type
the	numbers,	and	physical	card	payments,	where	you	tap	or	swipe	the
physical
	card.	In	the	industry,	an	online	credit	card	payment	is	known	as
a	‘card	
not
	present’	transaction,	and	swiping	your	card	at	the	cashier’s	till
in	a	shop	counts	as	a	‘card	present’	transaction.	Online	(card	not	present)
transactions	have	higher	rates	of	fraud,	so	in	an	effort	to	make	fraud
harder,	you	need	to	provide	more	details—such	as	your	address	and	the
three	digits	on	the	back	of	the	card.	Merchants	are	charged	higher	fees	for
these	types	of	payments	to	offset	the	cost	of	fraud	prevention	and	the
losses	from	fraud.
Cash	is	an	anonymous	bearer	asset	which	does	not	record	or	contain
identity	information,	unlike	many	forms	of	digital	money	that	by	law
require	personal	identification.	To	open	an	account	with	a	bank,	wallet,
or	other	trusted	third	party,	regulations	require	that	the	third	party	can
identify	you.	This	is	why	you	often	need	to	supply	information	about
yourself,	with	independent	evidence	to	back	that	up.	Usually	that	means	a
photo	ID	to	match	name	and	face,	and	a	utility	bill	or	other	‘official’
registered	communication	(for	example	from	a	government	department)
to	validate	your	address.	Identity	information	is	not	just	collected	when
opening	accounts.	It	is	also	collected	and	used	for	validation	purposes
when	some	electronic	payments	are	made:	when	you	pay	online	using	a
credit	or	debit	card	you	need	to	supply	your	name	and	address	as	a	first
gateway	against	fraud.
There	are	exceptions	to	this	identity	rule.	There	are	some	stored	value
cards	that	don’t	require	identity,	for	example	public	transport	cards	in
many	countries,	or	low-limit	cash	cards	used	in	some	countries.
Do	payments	
need
	to	be	linked	to	identity?	Of	course	not.	Cash	proves
this.	But	
should
	they?	This	is	a	big	question	that	raises	legal,
philosophical	and	ethical	issues	that	remain	subject	to	ongoing	debate.
Credit	card	information	is	frequently	stolen,	along	with	personally
identifying	information	(name,	addresses,	etc)	which	creates	a	cost	to
society.
Is	it	a	fundamental	right	to	be	able	to	make	payments	which	are	shielded
from	the	eyes	of	the	state	governments?	And	should	people	have	the
ability	to	make	anonymous	digital	payments,	as	they	do	with	physical
cash?	To	what	extent	should	our	financial	transactions	be	anonymous	or,
cash?	To	what	extent	should	our	financial	transactions	be	anonymous	or,
at	the	very	least,	private?	And	what,	if	any,	are	the	reasonable	limits	to
that	privacy?	Should	the	public	sector	or	the	private	sector	provide	the
means	for	electronic	payments	and	financial	privacy?	Should	a	nation
state	be	able	to	block	an	individual’s	ability	to	make	digital	payments,	and
with	what	limits?	How	can	we	reconcile	financial	privacy	with	the
prevention	of	support	for	illegal	activities,	including	the	funding	of
terrorism?	I	won’t	provide	answers	to	these	big	questions	in	this	book,
but	the	fundamental	questions	concerning	financial	privacy	are	inevitably
raised	when	understanding	the	game-changing	innovation	that	is	Bitcoin.
HOW DO WE DEFINE MONEY?
We	all	know	what	money	is,	but	how	might	we	define	it?	The	generally
accepted	academic	definition	of	money	usually	says	that	money	needs	to
fulfil	three	functions:	A	medium	of	exchange,	a	store	of	value,	and	a	unit
of	account.	But	what	does	this	really	mean?
Medium	of	exchange
	means	it	is	a	payment	mechanism—you	can	use
it	to	pay	someone	for	something,	or	to	extinguish	a	debt	or	financial
obligation.	To	be	a	good	medium	of	exchange,	it	doesn’t	need	to	be
universally
	accepted	(nothing	is),	but	it	should	be	should	be	widely
accepted	
in	the	particular	context
	for	which	it	is	being	used.
Store	of	value
	means	that	in	the	near	term	(however	you	define	this)
your	money	will	be	worth	the	same	as	it	is	today.	To	be	a	good	store	of
value,	you	need	to	be	reasonably	confident	that	your	money	will	buy	you
more	or	less	the	same	amount	of	goods	and	services	tomorrow,	next
month,	or	next	year.	When	this	breaks	down,	the	money’s	value	is	quickly
eroded,	a	process	often	referred	to	as	hyperinflation.	Individuals	quickly
develop	alternative	ways	to	denominate	value	and	undertake
transactions,	for	example	bartering	or	using	a	‘hard’	or	more	successful
and	stable	currency.
Unit	of	account
	means	it	is	something	that	you	can	use	to	compare	the
value	of	two	items,	or	to	count	up	the	total	value	of	your	assets.	If	you
record	the	value	of	all	of	your	possessions,	you	need	some	unit	to	price
them	in,	to	get	a	total.	Usually	that	is	your	home	currency	(GBP	or	USD
or	whatever),	but	you	could	in	theory	use	any	unit.	The	last	time	I
counted,	I	had	0.2	Lamborghinis	worth	of	gadgets	in	my	study.	To	be	a
good
	unit	of	account,	the	money	needs	to	have	a	well-accepted	or
understood	price	against	assets,	otherwise	it	is	hard	to	figure	out	the	total
value	across	all	your	assets	and,	if	you	need	to	do	so,	to	convince	others	of
that	value.
While	some	believe	that	‘good	money’	should	fulfil	all	of	these	functions,
others	think	that	the	three	functions	can	be	fulfilled	by	different
instruments.	For	example,	there	is	no	real	reason	why	something	used	as
a	medium	of	exchange	(i.e.,	something	that	can	be	used	to	immediately
settle	a	debt)	must	also	be	a	long	term	store	of	value.
Is	Today’s	Money	Good
	
Money?
It	is	debatable	how	well	the	forms	of	money	we	generally	regard	as	‘good
money’	stack	up	against	these	properties.	The	US	dollar	is	arguably	the
most	prominent	form	of	money	we	have	today,	and	can	be	considered	the
best,	at	least	for	the	time	being.	But	how	
good
	is	it?	The	dollar	is
generally	acceptable	for	payment,	certainly	in	the	USA,	and	even	in	other
countries,	so	it	is	an	excellent	medium	of	exchange	in	those	contexts	(but
less	so	in	Singapore).	And	it	is	an	excellent	unit	of	account,	because	many
assets	are	priced	in	dollars,	including	global	commodities	such	as	crude
oil	and	gold.
But	how	has	it	fared	as	a	store	of	value?	According	to	the	St	Louis	Fed,
the	purchasing	power	of	the	USD	from	a	consumer’s	perspective	has
fallen	by	over	96%	since	the	Federal	Reserve	System	was	created	in	1913.

.
Given	that	purchasing	power	of	the	USD	over	time	has	decreased
significantly,	it	has	been	a	poor	store	of	value	over	the	long	term.	Indeed,
people	don’t	tend	to	keep	banknotes	under	their	mattress	for	decades,
because	they	know	cash	is	not	a	good	store	of	value.	And	if	they	did,	they
would	find	that	the	purchasing	power	has	decreased,	or	worse,	that	the
banknotes	have	been	pulled	out	of	circulation	and	are	no	longer	accepted
in	shops.	In	fact,	the	dollar,	as	with	almost	all	government	currencies,
consistently	loses	value	by	design,	driven	by	policy.	We	can	predict,	more
or	less,	that	the	USD	will	lose	its	purchasing	power	by	a	few	percentage
points	each	year.	This	is	known	as	price	inflation	(as	opposed	to	currency
inflation	which	is	an	increase	in	the	number	of	dollars	in	circulation).
Price	inflation	is	measured	by	CPI	(Consumer	Price	Inflation)—an	index
measuring	the	changes	in	the	price	of	a	theoretical	basket	of	goods	that
are	reportedly	chosen	to	represent	typical	urban	household	spending
5
.
The	makeup	of	the	basket	changes	over	time,	and	policymakers	are	not
beyond	employing	various	tricks	with	that	basket	to	bend	the	rate	of
inflation	to	figures	they	find	more	convenient
6
.
So	perhaps	‘store	of	value’	is	a	not	a	good	medium	or	long	term	function
of	money,	and	perhaps	the	economists	and	textbooks	don’t	have	it	quite
of	money,	and	perhaps	the	economists	and	textbooks	don’t	have	it	quite
right.	We	certainly	need	all	three	‘functions	of	money,’	but	perhaps	not	in
the	same	instrument.	Perhaps	money	fulfils	one	need	(immediate
settlement	of	obligations),	whereas	the	longer-term	store	of	value	need
can	be	better	achieved	through	other	assets.	In	terms	of	the	‘store	of
value’	function	of	money,	it	is	more	the	short-term	predictability	of	value,
or	spending	power,	that	is	relevant:	I	need	to	know	that	a	dollar
tomorrow	or	next	month	can	buy	me	more	or	less	the	same	thing	as	a
dollar	today	and	will	settle	immediate	debts.	But	for	long	term
preservation	of	value,	perhaps	housing	or	land	or	other	assets	may	be
more	reliable.
How	do	cryptocurrencies	fare	against	the	standard	definitions
of
	
money?
Bitcoin	as	a	Medium	of
	
Exchange
	As	a	medium	of	exchange,
Bitcoin	has	some	interesting	characteristics.	It	is	the	very	first
digital	asset	of	value	that	can	be	transferred	over	the	internet
without	any	specific	third	party	having	to	approve	the
transaction	or	being	able	to	deny	it.	It	is	also	an	asset	that	is
transferred	from	one	owner	to	another	rather	than	moving	via
a	series	of	third	party	debits	and	credits,	for	example,	through
one	or	more	banks.	In	this	respect	it	is	genuinely	novel.
This	is	worth	repeating:	Bitcoin	is	the	very	first	digital	asset	of	value	that
can	be	transferred	over	the	internet	without	any	specific	third	party
having	to	approve	the	transaction	or	being	able	to	deny	it.
Can	you	make	payments	with	bitcoins?	Yes,	absolutely—anytime,
anywhere.	Is	it	fast?	Sometimes—depending	on	a	number	of	factors.	At	a
settlement	speed	varying	between	seconds	and	hours,	it	is	certainly	faster
than	some	traditional	payment	methods,	but	slower	than	others.
Different	cryptocurrencies	settle	transactions	at	different	speeds.
Is	Bitcoin	widely	accepted?	Well,	among	its	community	it	is	widely
accepted,	and	some	prefer	using	it	to	traditional	payment	mechanisms
7
.
But	by	a	global	standard,	no,	it	is	not	widely	accepted.	Could	this	change?
Could	more	and	more	people	and	businesses	accept	bitcoins	or	other
cryptocurrencies?	Perhaps	not	in	large	stable	economies,	but	possibly	in
unstable	smaller	economies.	There	are	a	number	of	factors	to	consider
when	deciding	if	bitcoins	should	be	used	in	preference	to	the	domestic
currency	or	existing	alternatives.
What	about	merchant	adoption?	Every	now	and	again,	you	might	read
that	a	merchant	now	accepts	bitcoins	or	other	cryptocurrencies	as
payment.	What’s	going	on?	Doesn’t	this	mean	bitcoins	are	improving	as	a
medium	of	exchange?	Well,	yes	and	no.	In	reality,	most	of	the	companies
who	say	that	they	accept	Bitcoin	as	payment	don’t	actually	accept	bitcoins
or	hold	them	on	their	balance	sheets.	Instead,	they	use	cryptocurrency
payment	processors	that	act	as	an	intermediary	by	quoting	a	price	to	the
customer	in	bitcoins	(based	on	current	prices	of	bitcoins	to	dollars	on
various	cryptocurrency	exchanges),	accepting	the	bitcoins	from	the
customer,	then	wiring	an	equivalent	amount	of	conventional	currency
(
fiat
	in	the	jargon)	the	boring	way	into	the	merchant’s	bank	account.
Here	is	how	it	works:	
1.
The	customer	fills	their	shopping	cart	with
items,	then	clicks	‘check	out’.
2.
They	are	presented	with	the	total	value	of	the	goods	
in	local
currency
.	‘How	would	you	like	to	pay?’
3.
Customer	selects	‘Bitcoin’.
4.
They	are	then	shown	the	number	of	bitcoins	that	they	need	to	pay.
The	payment	processor	calculates	this	number	by	using	the	current
exchange	rate	between	Bitcoin	and	local	currency,	found	on	one	or
more	cryptocurrency	exchanges.
5.
The	customer	then	has	a	short	amount	of	time	to	accept	the	price
before	the	price	of	Bitcoin	changes	and	the	payment	processor	has	to
re-price	the	basket.	The	pricing	refresh	time	can	be	as	short	as	30
seconds	due	to	Bitcoin’s	volatility.	30	seconds!
Bitpay
8
	is	a	good	example	of	this	kind	of	cryptocurrency	payment
processor.	In	2013-2015	a	number	of	merchants	announced	that	they
now	accepted	Bitcoin.	This	was	good	cheap	press	for	merchants,	and
many	companies	did	this:	Microsoft,	Dell,	and	even—my	favourite—
Richard	Branson	for	Virgin	Galactic	trips.	Just	think—in	2013	you	could
buy	a	trip	into	space	and	pay	in	bitcoins!	However,	since	then,	many
merchants	have	quietly	dropped	Bitcoin	as	a	method	of	payment.
So,	in	these	cases	where	a	merchant	says	they	accept	Bitcoin	as	payment,
bitcoins	
are
	a	medium	of	exchange	from	the	customer’s	perspective.	But
these	cases	are	rare,	and	currently	it	is	not	currently	a	widely	used
medium	of	exchange.	In	July	2017,	investment	bank	Morgan	Stanley
produced	a	report	on	Bitcoin	merchant	adoption
9
	that	found	that,	in
2016,	only	five	of	the	top	500	online	merchants	accepted	Bitcoin	and,	in
2017,	that	number	had	dropped	to	three.
Bitcoin	as	a	Store	of
	
Value
	For	now,	let’s	put	aside	the
argument	about	whether	‘store	of	value’	is	a	valid	property	of
money
,	or	if	it	should	be	an	attribute	of	an	
asset
.
Instead,	let’s	ask	the	question,	what	do	you	want	from	your	store	of
value?	What	is	its	job?	Is	its	job	to	make	you	richer	so	you	can	buy	more
toys,	or	is	its	job	to	maintain	its	value	so	you	can	plan	your	life	well?	And
if	the	job	of	the	thing	is	to	make	you	richer	so	you	can	buy	more	toys,	how
much	volatility	and	downside	risk	are	you	willing	to	stomach?	Are	we
talking	about	a	short-term	store	of	value,	perhaps	a	speculative
investment,	or	a	long-term	store	of	value,	often	a	lower	risk	asset?
Bitcoin	as	a	speculative	investment	has	performed	amazingly	well.
Anything	that	starts	at	a	price	of	zero,	and	is	not	currently	at	a	price	of
zero,	is	great.	Bitcoin	started	at	zero	value	in	2009	and	now,	less	than	ten
years	later,	each	Bitcoin	is	worth	thousands	of	dollars.	So	it	has	certainly
appreciated	in	value	since	its	creation.	But	would	you	buy	it	now?	Would
you	move	all	your	savings	into	this	asset	in	order	to	
store
	value	(as
opposed	to	gamble	and	hope	for	a	quick	price	appreciation)?	Well,	due	to
its	price	volatility,	which	is	very	high	compared	to	most	fiat	currencies,
the	answer	is	probably	no	if	you	are	looking	for	a	stable	store	of	value.	As
a	long-term	store	of	value	I	suppose	you	want,	as	a	minimum,	something
that	can	be	used	to	buy	a	basket	of	goods	in	twenty	years’	time	roughly
identical	to	the	basket	you	can	buy	with	it	now.	So,	if	you	had	bought	it	at
the	right	time,	Bitcoin	has	certainly	been	a	good	
investment
,	but	its
volatility	makes	it	a	nauseating	store	of	value.
Does	Bitcoin,	or	do	other	cryptocurrencies,	have	the	
potential
	to	keep
value	over	the	long	term,	as	some	people	expect	from	gold?	Possibly.
According	to	its	current	protocol	rules,	bitcoins	are	created	at	a	known
rate	(12.5	BTC	every	10	minutes	or	so)—and	that	rate	will	decrease	over
time.	So	the	supply	of	it	is	understood	and	predictable,	capped	to	almost
21	million	BTC	and	not	subject	to	arbitrary	creation,	unlike	fiat
currencies
10
.	Limiting	the	supply	of	something	can	help	maintain	its	value
if	demand	is	stable	or	increases,	though	the	downside	of	a	known,
predictable,	and	completely	inelastic	supply	unrelated	to	a	fluctuating
demand	results	in	perpetual	price	volatility
11
,	which	is	not	good	if	you	are
looking	for	price	stability.
Bitcoin	as	a	Unit	of
	
Account
	As	a	unit	of	account,	Bitcoin	fails
miserably,	due	to	its	price	volatility	against	USD	and
everything	else	in	the	world.	The	fact	that	there	are	almost	no
merchants	who	are	willing	to	price	items	in	bitcoins	(not	even
merchants	who	sell	cryptocurrency	related	paraphernalia)	is
evidence	that	bitcoins	are	not	a	good	unit	of	account.
You	wouldn’t	keep	your	accounts	in	BTC.	You	wouldn’t	record	the	price	of
your	laptop	in	BTC.	You	certainly	wouldn’t	do	your	year-end	bookkeeping
in	BTC
12
,	and	if	you	tried	to	file	mandatory	accounts	in	BTC	you	would	fall
foul	of	accounting	standards	in	all	jurisdictions.	If	you	were	a	masochist,
you	
could
	prepare	an	inventory	and	denominate	everything	in	BTC,	but
first	you’d	figure	out	the	price	of	things	in	USD	(say,	my	laptop	is	worth
about	$200),	then	you’d	convert	that	number	to	a	Bitcoin	number	at	a
‘what	is	the	price	of	Bitcoin	in	dollars	at	this	very	second?’	ratio.	So	then,
very	briefly,	you	could	say	‘all	my	worldly	possessions	are	worth	3.0364
BTC’.	Within	minutes	or	hours,	that	BTC	number	would	almost	certainly
be	meaningless	as	the	BTC	to	USD	price	fluctuates	so	rapidly.
Monetary	economist	JP	Koning	compared	the	price	volatility	of	Bitcoin	to
gold	and	made	the	following	observation	on	Twitter
13
:	
Will	the	price	volatility	of	Bitcoin	decrease?	It	is	anyone’s	guess,	but	I
personally	doubt	it.	One	argument	I	used	to	hear	was,	‘When	the	price	of
BTC	gets	really	high,	the	price	volatility	will	decrease	because	it	will	take
a	lot	more	money	to	bully	the	price	up	and	down’.	The	argument	is
flawed.	A	price	can	be	high,	but	if	a	market	is	illiquid,	small	amounts	of
money	can	still	push	the	price	around.	Stability	is	determined	more	by
the	
liquidity
	of	a	market	(how	many	people	are	willing	to	buy	and	sell	at
any	price	point),	than	the	
price
	of	an	asset.	But	even	liquid	markets	can
move	quickly	if	the	market’s	perception	of	the	value	of	the	asset	changes
suddenly.	Also,	this	argument	is	predicated	on	the	price	of	Bitcoin	getting
really	high…	There	is	no	good	reason	why	the	price	of	Bitcoin	should	ever
go	‘really	high’.	Furthermore,	as	discussed	earlier,	Bitcoin’s	supply	is
inelastic
.	If	there	is	a	spike	in	demand,	there	is	no	impact	on	the	rate	at
which	bitcoins	are	generated,	unlike	normal	goods	and	services,	so	there
is	no	dampening	effect	on	the	price,	and	this	holds	true	for	any	price
point—
even	if
	volatility	decreased,	traders	may	just	take	bigger	bets,
often	with	leverage,	which	would	then	move	the	price	again.
At	the	time	of	writing	there	is	a	quest	for	‘stable	coins’—cryptocurrencies
whose	prices	are	relatively	stable	compared	to	some	other	thing,	for
example	a	US	dollar.	Unless	they	are	backed	1	to	1	with	the	relevant	asset,
stable	coins	are	very	hard	to	produce	because	essentially	you	are	trying	to
peg	the	price	of	something	dynamic	to	something	else	with	a	different
dynamic,	and	as	we	will	see	in	the	next	section	about	history	of	money,	no
one	has	ever	been	successful	at	this	in	the	long	term:	Pegs	always
eventually	break.	If	a	successful	stable	coin	
were
	to	emerge,	things	could
become	more	interesting
14
.
There	is	one	case	where	BTC	may	be	used	as	a	unit	of	account:	when
valuing	baskets	of	other	cryptocurrencies.	If	you	are	a	normal	trader
trading	normal	assets	like	shares,	it	is	a	good	idea	to	understand	the
current	value	of	your	assets	in	your	home	currency—for	example	USD,
EUR,	or	GBP.	If	you	are	a	cryptocurrency	trader,	you	probably	still	want
to	understand	your	total	asset	value	in	your	home	currency,	but	in	this
very	specific	case,	you	may	also	want	to	understand	your	total	balance	in
BTC	as	it	is	the	market	leader	in	the	cryptocurrency	world—you	could	say
BTC	is	the	USD	of	cryptocurrencies.	Perhaps	your	investors	let	you
manage	some	bitcoins	with	the	hope	that	you	will	turn	their	bitcoins	into
more	bitcoins.	In	this	case,	the	value	of	your	assets	in	BTC	is	more
important	than	the	value	in	USD.	This	is	a	niche	case.
The	Current	State	of	Cryptocurrencies	as
	
Money
	Mark	Carney,
Governor	of	the	Bank	of	England,	summarised	the	current
state	of	the	
moneyness
	of	Bitcoin	during	a	Q&A	session	at
Regent’s	University	London	on	19	February	2018
15
:	‘[Bitcoin]
has	pretty	much	failed	thus	far	on…the	traditional	aspects	of
money.	It	is	not	a	store	of	value	because	it	is	all	over	the	map.
Nobody	uses	it	as	a	medium	of	exchange…’
Bitcoin	may	be	suffering	growing	pains	in	its	infancy,	but	this	doesn’t
mean	that	we	should	write	it	off	and	that	the	story	must	end	here.
According	to	the	Bitcoin	Obituary	website,
16
	Bitcoin	has	been	declared
dead	over	300	times!	But	it	lives	on—at	the	very	least,	it	still	trades	on
exchanges	with	a	nonzero	price.	It	seems	that	people	try	to	fit	Bitcoin	into
an	existing	bucket	(‘It	is	a	currency	
asset	
property	/	digital	gold’),	and
when	it	exhibits	some	properties	that	do	not	match	others	in	that	bucket,
it	is	declared	a	failure.	Maybe	the	answer	is	to	not	try	to	fit	it	into	any
existing	bucket,	but	to	design	or	define	a	new	bucket,	and	to	judge	Bitcoin
and	other	cryptoassets	on	their	own	merits.
Also	note	that	central	bankers	have	a	potential	conflict	of	interest	when
commenting	on	new	forms	of	money.	Central	bankers	have	a	critical	role
to	maintain	monetary	and	economic	stability,	and	their	tools	(quantity	of
money	in	the	economy	and	the	price	of	borrowing	money)	are	applied	to
their	respective	fiat	currencies.	Any	new	form	of	money,	if	widely	adopted
and	if	not	under	the	control	of	the	central	bank,	could	potentially
undermine	the	ability	of	the	central	bank	to	fulfil	its	mandate.	New	forms
of	money	could	be	disruptive	and	destabilise	economies,	which,	from	a
of	money	could	be	disruptive	and	destabilise	economies,	which,	from	a
central	banker’s	point	of	view	is	not	a	good	thing.	So	you	wouldn’t	expect
central	bankers	to	warmly	embrace	new	forms	of	money	that	are	not
under	their	control.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF MONEY—
DISPELLING THE MYTHS
So	far,	we	have	discussed	cryptocurrencies	and	how	they	measure	up	as
‘money’	
as	we	currently	define	it
.	But	has	money	always	been	the	same?
In	order	to	understand	where	cryptocurrencies	might	fit	in,	we	should	try
to	understand	the	history	of	money	itself—its	successes,	failures,	and
technological	innovations.	It	is	a	fascinating	topic,	as	there	are	so	many
interesting	tidbits	and	common	misunderstandings	to	straighten	out.

The	concepts	and	eras	I	want	to	touch	on	are:
•
Barter	(let’s	exchange	valuable	things)
•
Commodity	money	(the	money	
is
	the	valuable	thing)
•
Representative	money	(the	money	is	a	
claim
	on	the	valuable	thing)
•
Fiat	currency	(the	money	is	
completely	de-linked
	from	any	valuable
thing)
Barter
It	is	common	knowledge	that	before	money	existed	transactions	were
carried	by	exchanging	goods	when	both	parties	agreed	on	the	deal.	‘Sir,
your	five	ugly	old	sheep	for	my	twenty	bushels	of	fine	corn’.	But	barter	is
difficult.	It	is	very	rare	that	you	want	something	the	other	person	has,	and
at	the	same	time,	they	want	something	you	have,	and	that	you’re	both
prepared	and	able	to	make	a	trade.	Economists	call	such	a	rare	situation	a
‘double	coincidence	of	wants,’	and	aside	from	market	days	in	subsistence
economies	this	situation	almost	never	occurs.	So,	the	argument	goes,
money	was	invented	to	lubricate	the	deal.	Money	is	something	that
everyone	is	happy	to	accept	in	exchange	for	other	things,	so	it	serves	as
the	intermediary	asset	for	the	times	when	you	don’t	have	something	that
the	other	person	wants.	In	summary,	the	inefficiency	of	barter	gave	rise
to	money.
This	elegant	argument	seems	intellectually	neat.	Unfortunately,	however,
there	is	not	a	shred	of	evidence	for	it.	It	is	pure	fantasy—the	textbooks	are
wrong!	When	you	hear	someone	talk	about	money	being	invented	to
replace	barter,	do	please	educate	them	or	talk	to	someone	else.
Money	solving	the	inefficiencies	of	barter	is	a	myth	popularised	in	1776
by	Adam	Smith	in	
The	Wealth	of	Nations
.	Ilana	E	Strauss	discusses	this
in	an	amusing	and	eye-opening	read,	‘The	Myth	of	the	Barter	Economy’
published	in	
The	Atlantic
19
,	in	which	she	quotes	Cambridge	Anthropology
Professor	Caroline	Humphrey	in	a	1985	paper,	‘
Barter	and	Economic
Disintegration
’
20
:
‘No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the
emergence from it of money, … All available ethnography suggests that there never has been
such a thing’.
Economies	developed	based	on	mutual	trust,	gifts	and	debt	or	social
obligations—‘H
ave	a	chicken	now,	but	please	remember	this	for	later’.
Early	communities	were	small	and	stable,	and	individuals	tended	to	grow
up	with	each	other	and	know	each	other	well.	Reputation	within	a
community	was	crucially	important,	so	people	didn’t	tend	to	renege	on
their	word.	But	people	still	had	to	keep	some	sort	of	record	of	debts	or
favours	owed.	Trading	(the	simultaneous	exchange	of	non-monetary
goods)	did	exist,	but	mainly	occurred	where	there	was	a	lack	of	trust,	for
example	with	strangers	or	enemies,	or	where	there	was	a	strong
possibility	that	debt	wouldn’t	be	remembered	or	couldn’t	easily	be	repaid,
such	as	with	travelling	merchants.
The	emergence	of	money	to	solve	the	problem	of	repaying	a	debt	or
favour	makes	more	sense	than	the	emergence	of	money	as	a	solution	to
the	
double	coincidence	of	wants
.	Indeed,	David	Graeber	details	the
existence	of	debt	and	credit	systems	before	money,	which	itself	appeared
before
	barter,	in	his	fascinating	and	influential	book	
Debt:	The	First
5,000	Years
21
.
Commodity	Money
With	commodity	money	the	physical	token	that	is	transacted	is	
itself
valuable,	for	example	grain,	which	has	intrinsic	value,	or	precious	metals,
which	have	extrinsic	value.
Good	forms	of	commodity	money	have	a	stable	and	known	value	and	are
relatively	easy	to	keep	and	exchange,	or	‘spend’.	They	also	need	to	be
consistent,	and	a	standardised	unit	makes	things	easier.	Examples	are
standardised	quantities	of	grain	or	cattle,	which	have	intrinsic	value	by
being	edible,	and	precious	metals	or	shells,	which	have	extrinsic	value	by
being	both	scarce	and	beautiful.
Note:	An	argument	that	cryptocurrency	proponents	like	to	use	is	that	the
tokens	should	be	valuable	because	they	are	
scarce
	(‘There	will	only	be	21
million	bitcoins	ever,	so	that	is	what	makes	them	valuable!’).	This	is	not	a
solid	argument.	Something	may	be	scarce,	but	that	doesn’t	mean	it	is,	or
should	be,	valuable.	There	must	be	one	or	more	underlying	factors	that
make	it	desirable—beauty,	utility,	something	else.	And	these	underlying
factors	must	create	demand	for	the	item.	The	two	underlying	factors	in
Bitcoin	that	create	demand	are:
1.
It	is	the	most	recognised	instrument	of	value	that	can	be	transmitted
across	the	internet	without	needing	permission	from	specific
intermediaries.
2.
It	is	censorship	resistant.
Representative	Money
Representative	money	is	a	form	of	money	whose	value	is	derived	by	being
a	
claim
	on	some	underlying	item,	for	example	a	receipt	from	a	goldsmith
for	some	gold	they	are	safekeeping.	The	receipt	may	be	passed	to	another
party	to	transfer	that	value.	You	could	say	that	the	value	of	the	token	is
backed	by
	the	value	of	the	underlying	asset.	Warehouse	accounts	or
receipts	(or	‘tokens’)	are	backed	by	the	value	of	the	goods	contained	in
the	warehouse	and	are	good	examples	of	representative	money.
Representative	money	differs	from	commodity	money	in	that	it	relies	on
a	third	party	(e.g.,	the	manager	of	the	warehouse	or	the	goldsmith)	to	be
able	to	supply	the	underlying	item	on	redemption	of	the	tokens,	so	there
is	some	counterparty	risk:	What	if	the	third	party	fails?
Representative	money	tokens	were	similar	to	bearer	bonds,	where	the
person	holding	a	piece	of	paper	was	entitled	to	reclaim	the	value	of	the
underlying	asset	(sometimes	on	demand,	sometimes	on	a	due	date).
These	tokens	were	used	as	we	use	cash	today	to	settle	transactions,	and
were	a	stepping	stone	between	use	of	commodity	money	(e.g.,	precious
metal	coins)	and	fiat	currency.
Fiat	Currency
Commodity	money	was	gradually	replaced	by	representative	money
which	in	turn	has	now	almost	entirely	been	replaced	by	‘fiat	money’.	All
major	recognisable	sovereign	currencies	now	are	fiat.	Fiat	(pronounced
fee-at,	Latin	for	‘let	it	be	done’)	is	money	because	legislation	says	so,
rather	than	because	it	has	a	fundamental	or	intrinsic	value.	Fiat	money
neither	has	intrinsic	value	nor	is	it	convertible
22
.	Statements	on	banknotes
often	say	something	along	the	lines	of	‘I	promise	to	pay	the	bearer	on
demand	the	sum	of	…’	but	you	won’t	get	very	far	if	you	go	to	the	issuer	of
the	fiat	currency—usually	the	central	bank—and	say,	‘Hey,	give	me	some
of	the	underlying	asset	back	for	this’.	At	best	you	will	get	a	new	banknote.
So	how	and	why	are	fiat	currencies	valuable?	Two	main	reasons:
1.
They	are	declared	by	law	as	
legal	tender
,	meaning	that	in	that	legal
jurisdiction	it	must	be	accepted	as	valid	payment	for	a	debt.
Therefore	people	use	it.
2.
Governments	accept	only	their	own	fiat	for	tax	payments.	This	gives
fiat	currencies	a	fundamental	usefulness,	as	everyone	needs	to	pay
tax
23
.
The	Economist
	newspaper	has	described	cryptocurrencies	as	having	fiat
characteristics
24
	as	it	is	simply	declared	so,	but	to	date,	cryptocurrencies
have	not	been	declared	legal	tender	in	any	nation.	We	will	discuss	legal
tender	later	in	the	book.
Money Through the Ages
Here	I	have	tried	to	pick	out	interesting	events	in	the	history	of	money
that	help	to	form	a	picture	of	how	we	got	to	where	we	are	now.
9,000	BCE:	Cattle—Commodity
	
Money
The	earliest	forms	of	commodity	money	were	livestock,	particularly
cattle,	and	plant	products	such	as	grain.	Cattle	have	been	used	as
commodity	money	from	c.9,000	BCE.	As	such,	the	cow	is	probably	the
most	enduring,	if	not	successful,	form	of	money.	They	are	still	used	today
in	some	parts	of	the	world.	For	example,	in	March	2018,	100	cattle	stolen
in	Kenya	were	believed	to	be	used	for	paying	a	dowry
25
.
Would	a	cow	pass	the	three	‘is	it	money’	questions	that	economists	like	to
use?	History	tells	us	that	cows	are	a	medium	of	exchange,	so	it	ticks	that
box.	You	would	assume	that	if	it	is	used	for	buying	and	selling	things,
people	might	have	some	sort	of	idea	of	the	price	of	other	objects	
in	cows
.
If	so,	that	would	make	a	cow	a	decent	unit	of	account.	But	is	it	a	store	of
value?	Hmm,	there	are	some	complexities—the	price	of	cows	varies	by
breed	and	age	and	individuals	can	drop	down	dead.	On	the	other	hand,
cows	have	a	kind	of	interest	rate,	in	that	they	are	able	to	reproduce.	So,
while	any	single	cow	may	not	be	a	very	good	store	of	value,	a	herd
arguably	is.	Monetary	economists	enjoy	arguing	about	things	like	this.
3,000	BCE:	Banks
Between	about	3,000	and	2,000	BCE,	banks	were	created	in	Babylon,
Mesopotamia,	the	land	now	roughly	equating	to	Iraq,	Kuwait,	and	Syria.
Banks	evolved	from	the	warehouses	that	were	places	for	the	safekeeping
of	commodities	such	as	grain,	cattle,	and	precious	metals.
2,200	BCE:	Lumps	of
	
Silver
Around	2,250-2,150	BCE	silver,	ingots	were	standardised	and	guaranteed
by	the	state	in	Cappadocia	(in	present	day	Turkey),	and	this	helped	their
acceptance	as	money.	Silver	was	the	‘gold	standard’	of	precious	metal
money.	This	notes	an	interesting	shift	from	using	commodities	that
clearly	have	an	intrinsic	value	(cattle	and	grain	that	you	can	eat)	to
commodities	that	have	an	extrinsic	value	because	of	their	scarcity	and
durability.	During	this	shift,	you	can	imagine	people	then	having	the
same	arguments	as	we	do	today	with	Bitcoin.	‘Yes,	but	silver	doesn’t	have
intrinsic
	value—I	can’t	feed	my	family	with	it’.	At	the	next	dinner	party	if
‘intrinsic	value’	is	brought	up,	you	can	say	‘Come	on	guys,	we’ve	been
having	this	argument	since	2,200	BCE…’
1,800	BCE:	Regulation!
If	you	want	to	blame	someone	for	regulation,	blame	Hammurabi,	sixth
King	of	Babylon,	who	reigned	between	1792	and	1,750	BCE	and
developed	the	
Code	of	Hammurabi
.	This	set	of	laws	was	once	considered
the	earliest	written	legislation	in	human	history,	and	the	282	case	laws
include	economic	provisions	(prices,	tariffs,	trade,	and	commerce),	family
law	(marriage	and	divorce),	as	well	as	criminal	law	(assault,	theft),	and
civil	law	(slavery,	debt).	It	included	the	very	first	laws	for	banking
operations.

.
Just	think—those	libertarians	who	proclaim	that	regulation	is
unnecessary,	but	then	demand	that	something	must	be	done	when	they
lose	money	in	cryptocurrency	scams,	are	just	discovering	the	value	of
regulations	that	have	existed	ever	since	laws	were	first	written	down!
1,200	BCE:	Shell
	
Money
In	1,200	BCE,	cowry	shells	were	used	as	money	in	China.	Cowries	are	sea
snails,	most	commonly	found	on	the	shores	of	the	Indian	Ocean	and	the
waters	of	Southeast	Asia.	Wikipedia	describes	cowries	as:
a group of small to large sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Cypraeidae, the
cowries. The word cowry is also often used to refer only to the shells of these snails, which
overall are often shaped more or less like an egg, except that they are rather flat on the
underside.

27
Accor
ding	to	the	World	Register	of	Marine	Species
28
	(WORMS),	the
zoological	name	for	cowries	is	
Monetaria	Moneta
	(Linnaeus,	1758).	This
sea	snail	is	so	‘money’	the	scientists	named	it	‘money	money!’
In	fact,	the	Chinese	named	these	creatures	as	‘money’	well	before	the
West	did—the	radical	
貝
(
贝
	in	simplified	Chinese	and	pronounced	bèi),
means	shell	or	currency,	and	it	even	looks	like	one	of	the	cowries.	Chinese
words	and	characters	related	to	money,	property,	or	wealth	often	use	this
radical.

29
As	with	cattle,	the	practice	of	using	cowry	shells	as	money	survived	until
as	recently	as	the	1950s	in	parts	of	Africa.
700-600	BCE:	Mixed	Metal
	
Coins
In	640-630	BCE,	we	see	the	earliest	examples	of	coins	in	Lydia	(now
Turkey),	which	was	a	trading	hub	with	large	gold	supplies.	The	first	coins
were	made	of	a	naturally	occurring	mixture	of	gold	and	silver	called
electrum.	It	is	no	coincidence	that	one	of	the	earliest	popular	Bitcoin
wallets,	created	in	2011	by	Thomas	Voegtlin,	is	also	called	Electrum

According	to	the	British	Museum,	these	coins	were	not	consistently
round,	but	were	created	to	various	standard	weights.	It	is	thought	that
the	coins	were	weighed	rather	than	counted	for	many	transactions.
600-300	BCE:	Round
	
Coins
The	first	round	coins	emerged	in	China,	made	of	base	(non-precious)
metals.	These	were	still	commodity	money,	so	their	value	was	the	value	of
the	metal,	which	was	low.	Their	low	value	meant	that	the	coins	were
useful	for	daily	transactions.
c.	550	BCE:	Pure	Precious	Metal
	
Coins
Lydia,	which	must	have	been	the	Silicon	Valley	of	the	Iron	Age	world,
continued	to	innovate,	producing	separate	silver	and	gold	coins,	and
usage	of	these	started	to	spread.	I	suppose	this	is	one	of	the	earliest
examples	of	‘FinTech’	(financial	technology):	using	technology	to	invent
new	financial	instruments.	Next	time	a	banker	effuses	that	they	are
pioneers	of	FinTech,	you	can	tell	them	that	Lydians	got	there	first	in	550
BCE!
According	to	Amelia	Dowler,	curator	at	the	British	Museum,
Silver was more widely available than gold and with a lower value could be used for smaller
transactions and was therefore better in the marketplace. So, it was silver coinage which
gained rapidly in popularity and, during the sixth century BC, mints opened in Greek cities
across the
 
Mediterranean.

405	BCE:	First	Example	of	Gresham’s
	
Law
In	405	BCE,	Aristophanes’	famous	political	satire	
The	Frogs
	was
produced.	It	tells	of	the	adventures	of	Dionysus	and	his	slave	in	their
quest	to	bring	witty	poet	Euripides	back	from	the	underworld	to	Athens,
which	had	become	boring.	The	play	contains	the	first	known	example	of
Gresham’s	Law,	that	
bad	money	drives	out	good
.	What	this	means	is	that
you’d	rather	hold	on	to	good/more	valuable	money	and	spend	the
bad/less	valuable	money	if	others	will	accept	it.	So	if	you	have	the	choice
between	spending	a	
pure
	gold	coin	or	a	
debased
	gold	coin	(with	other
base	metals	mixed	in),	and	they	both	have	the	same	face	value,	then	you
will	of	course	spend	the	debased	one,	and	the	good	money	disappears
from	circulation.
Here	is	the	Chorus	lamenting	that	they	now	use	new	ugly	copper	coins
instead	of	old	gold	coins—and	with	a	bit	of	anti-immigrant	sentiment
thrown	in	for	good	measure:
The freedom of the city has often appeared to us to be similarly circumstanced with regard to
the good and honourable citizens, as to the old coin and the new gold. 
For neither do we
employ these at all
, 
which are not adulterated
, but the most excellent, as it appears, of all
coins, and alone correctly struck, and proved by ringing every where, both among the Greeks
and the barbarians, 
but this vile copper coin, struck but yesterday and lately with the
vilest stamp
; and we insult those of the citizens whom we know to be well-born, and
discreet, and just, and good, and honourable men, and who have been trained in palæstras,
and choruses, and music; while we use for every purpose the brazen, foreigners, and slaves,
rascals, and sprung from rascals, who are the latest come; whom the city before this would
not heedlessly and readily have used even as scape-goats.

345	BCE:	Origins	of	the	Words	Mint	and
	
Money
In	the	centre	of	Rome	a	temple	was	built,	dedicated	to	goddess	Juno
Moneta.	Juno	was	the	goddess	of	protection	and	Moneta	is	derived	from
the	Latin	
monere
,	which	means	‘to	warn	or	advise’.	It	is	said	that	Goddess
Juno	gave	warnings	or	advice	on	at	least	a	couple	of	occasions.	First,
when	the	Gauls	sacked	Rome	in	390	BCE,	Juno’s	sacred	geese	gave
Roman	commander	
Marcus	Manlius	Capitolinus
	a	heads	up	that	the
Gauls	were	coming,	allowing	him	to	protect	the	Capitol.	Second,	during
an	earthquake	when	a	voice	from	the	temple	advised	the	Romans	to
sacrifice	a	pregnant	sow
34
.
From	269	BCE,	the	Roman	mint	was	located	at	this	temple,	and	lasted
some	centuries.	The	English	words	‘mint’	and	‘money’	are	derived	from
Juno	Moneta.
336–323	BCE:	Gold	to	Silver
	
Peg
Alexander	the	Great	simplified	the	silver	to	gold	exchange	rate	by
declaring	a	fixed	exchange	rate	of	ten	units	of	silver	equal	to	one	unit	of
gold.	This	peg	eventually	failed.
The	Americans	effectively	tried	the	same	thing	in	the	eighteenth	century
at	rates	of	15:1	and	16:1.	Later,	we	will	discuss	what	currency	pegs	are,
how	they	are	managed,	and	how	difficult	they	are	to	maintain.	This	is
relevant	today	because	there	are	a	number	of	attempts	to	create	a	‘stable
coin’	cryptocurrency,	some	of	which	rely	on	an	entity	or	automated	smart
contract	to	defend	a	peg	by	buying	when	the	price	is	too	low	and	selling
when	the	price	is	too	high.
323–30	BCE:	Warehouse	Receipts—Representative
	
Money
Ptolemy,	a	Greek	bodyguard	of	Alexander	the	Great,	established	himself
as	ruler	of	Egypt.	He	created	a	dynasty	which	ruled	Egypt	until	the
demise	of	Cleopatra	with	the	Roman	conquest	of	30	BCE.	The	Ptolemies,
as	the	rulers	were	known,	established	a	system	of	warehouse	accounts
where	debts	could	be	repaid	by	transferring	the	title	to	grain	from	one
owner	to	another	without	physically	moving	the	grain	stored	within.
118	BCE:	Leather
	
Banknotes
Square	white	deerskin	leather	with	colourful	borders	was	used	as	money
in	China.	This	is	possibly	the	first	documented	type	of	banknote.	China
would	later	experiment	with	paper-based	banknotes,	then	stop	using
them	for	a	few	hundred	years	before	reintroducing	them.
30	BCE–14	CE:	Tax
	
reform!
Augustus	Caesar,	adopted	son	of	Julius	Caesar,	expanded	Rome’s
taxation	of	the	provinces,	regularising	tax	levies	which,	until	then,	had
been	decentralised	to	the	provinces.	He	introduced	sales,	land,	and	poll
taxes.	These	taxes	weren’t	universally	unpopular,	especially	in	the
provinces,	where	taxes	until	then	had	been	somewhat	arbitrary.	If	you
hate	paying	taxes,	you	probably	hate	paying	arbitrary	taxes	at	arbitrary
frequencies	even	more.	Augustus	Caesar	also	issued	new,	almost	pure,
gold,	silver,	brass,	and	copper	coins.
To	270	CE:	Debasement	and
	
Inflation
Over	the	next	300	years,	the	silver	content	of	Roman	coins	fell	from
100%	to	4%.	Talk	about	debasement!	But	as	we	saw	earlier,	the	US	dollar
has	fallen	in	value	by	96%	in	a	third	of	the	time
35
.	Attempts	by	leaders
such	as	Emperor	Aurelian	to	purify	coinage	failed,	as	Gresham’s	Law
kicked	in	and	people	circulated	their	debased	coins	and	hoarded	the	pure
ones.
306–337	CE:	Gold	for	the	Rich,	Debased	Coins	for	the
	
Poor
Constantine,	the	first	Christian	Roman	emperor,	issued	a	new	gold	coin,
Constantine,	the	first	Christian	Roman	emperor,	issued	a	new	gold	coin,
the	Solidus,	which	was	used	successfully	and	without	debasement	for	the
next	700	years.	That	is	quite	some	achievement.	However	he	also
produced	debased	silver	and	copper	coins.	So	the	rich	got	to	use	nice
shiny	gold	coins	that	retained	value	while	the	poor	got	coins	that	steadily
decreased	in	value.	Is	that	surprising?
c.	435	CE:	No	More	Coins	for	Brits	for	200
	
Years
Anglo-Saxons	invaded	Britain	and	coins	were	no	longer	used	as	money
for	200	years!	Money,	it	turns	out,	can	come	in	and	out	of	fashion,
depending	on	the	politics	at	the	time.	Just	because	we	grow	up	with	one
form	of	money,	it	doesn’t	mean	it	will	last	forever.
806–821	CE:	Fiat	Money	in
	
China
Due	to	a	shortage	of	copper,	Chinese	emperor	Hien	Tsung	issued	paper
money	notes	for	merchants	who	wanted	to	make	large	payments	without
the	inconvenience	of	heavy	coins.	Over	the	next	few	hundred	years	there
was	much	overprinting	and	inflation,	causing	paper	money	to	depreciate
against	metals.	This	is	a	theme	we	hear	over	and	over	again.
Paper	money	spread	to	Europe	via	Marco	Polo,	a	Venetian	who	travelled
extensively	and	learnt	of	paper	money	from	his	travels	in	China	from
1275
–
1292.
Paper	money	was	only	used	in	China	for	a	few	hundred	years,	during
which	time	inflation	soared	due	to	uncontrolled	printing	of	paper	money.
In	the	1400s,	they	seem	to	have	stopped	using	paper	money	for	a	few
hundred	years.
1300s:	British	Pennies	Shrink
	
Twice
In	1344	and	1351,	on	two	separate	occasions,	King	Edward	III	reduced
the	size	and	quality	of	the	penny.	The	King	owned	the	mints,	so	a	smaller
and	less	fine	penny	meant	that	the	King	could	issue	more	pennies	from
the	same	amount	of	metal,	meaning	more	profits	or	
seigniorage
	for	the
King.
The	debasement	of	all	forms	of	money	that	is	not	commodity	money
seems	to	be	a	common	theme	in	the	history	of	money.
1560:	Gresham’s
	
Law!
Another	year,	another	currency	reform:	this	time	Queen	Elizabeth	I
recalled	and	melted	coins,	separating	the	base	metals	from	the	precious
metals.	Thomas	Gresham	became	an	advisor	to	the	Queen	and	noticed
that	bad	money	drives	out	good.
1600s:	The	Rise	of	the
	
Goldsmiths
Goldsmiths	in	Britain	became	bankers,	as	their	vaults	were	used	for	coin
storage,	and	their	notes	and	receipts	became	a	convenient	method	of
payment.
1660s:	Central
	
Banking
The	world’s	oldest	central	bank,	Sveriges	Riksbank,	was	created	in
Sweden.	Initially,	the	Bank	was	forbidden	to	issue	banknotes	due	to
lessons	learnt	from	Stockholms	Banco,	Sweden’s	first	bank.	Stockholms
Banco	issued	Europe’s	first	banknotes	but	got	carried	away	and	issued
more	than	could	be	redeemed,	a	money	creation	technique	known	as
fractional	reserve	banking.	Stockholms	Banco	failed	when	banknote
holders	wanted	the	underlying	metal	coins	back.	In	1668,	Sveriges
Riksbank	was	founded	and	later,	in	1701,	it	was	allowed	to	issue
banknotes,	then	called	credit	notes.	It	gained	exclusivity	over	banknote
printing	200	years	later	in	1897	with	the	first	Riksbank	Act.

The	Riksbank	is	noted	for	its	attitude	towards	innovation:	in	July	2009,	it
was	the	first	central	bank	to	charge	money	from	commercial	banks	to
maintain	overnight	deposits,	rather	than	paying	interest,	pushing	the
overnight	deposit	rate	down	to	-0.25%	(annualised).	It	deepened	this
interest	rate,	as	well	as	other	associated	rates,	in	2014	and	2015.	This	was
an	effort	to	stimulate	the	economy	by	encouraging	the	lending	and
spending	of	money	rather	than	hoarding,	when	quantitative	easing	was
not	having	the	desired	effect.
1727:	Overdrafts!
The	Royal	Bank	of	Scotland	was	founded,	introducing	an	overdraft
facility	where	certain	applicants	were	able	to	borrow	money	up	to	a
certain	limit	and	were	charged	interest	only	on	the	amount	drawn,	rather
than	on	the	full	amount.	This	was	a	form	of	FinTech.
1800-1860:	Cowrie
	
Depreciation
Here	is	a	powerful	example	of	how	the	supply	of	money	causes	price
inflation:	When	cowrie	shells	were	first	introduced	to	Uganda	around
1800,	a	woman	could	typically	be	bought	for	two	shells.	Over	the	next	60
years,	as	more	shells	were	imported	at	scale,	prices	rose,	and	by	1860	a
woman	commanded	a	price	of	one	thousand	shells.
Rai
	
Stones
No	history	of	money	would	be	complete	without	mentioning	the	Rai
(sometimes	called	Fei)	stones	still	in	use	on	the	island	of	Yap.
Yap	is	a	small	island	in	the	Federated	States	of	Micronesia,	approximately
2,000km	east	of	Manila,	Philippines.	It	is	known	for	its	superb	SCUBA
diving	and	its	Rai	stones.	Rai	stones	are	large,	circular	stone	discs	with
holes	in	the	middle,	to	help	transportation.	They	are	made	with	stone
quarried	from	Palau	island,	about	400	km	away,	brought	back	by	canoe
with	some	effort,	and	still	are	used	as	money	today.
John	Tharngan,	Historical	Preservation	Officer	of	Yap,	in	an	interview
with	the	BBC
37
,	explains	the	origin	of	the	Rai	stones:
Several hundred years ago, some people from Yap went on a fishing trip and got lost and
arrived accidentally in Palau. They saw the limestone structures that occur naturally on that
island and thought they looked great. They broke off a piece of stone and did a bit of carving
on it with shell tools. They brought home a stone that was shaped like a whale, which is
called ‘Rai’ in Yapese and that is where the word comes from.
Rai	stones	come	in	all	sorts	of	sizes,	from	a	few	hand	spans	to	over	3
metres	in	diameter,	and	have	a	value	mainly	based	on	their	history,	but
also	on	their	size	and	finish.	According	to	monetary	economist	JP
Koning’s	excellent	blog	
Moneyness
38
,	W.H.	Furness,	who	spent	a	year	on
the	island,	wrote	in	his	1910	book	
The	Island	of	Stone	Money,	Uap	of	the
Carolines
:
A rai spanning a length of three hands and of good whiteness and shape ought to purchase
fifty ‘baskets’; of food—a basket is about eighteen inches long and ten inches deep, and the
food is taro roots, husked coconuts, yams, and bananas;- or, it is worth an eighty or a
hundred pound pig, or a thousand coconuts, or a pearl shell measuring the length of the hand
plus the width of three fingers up the wrist. I exchanged a small short handled axe for a good
white rai, fifty centimeters in diameter. For another Rai, a little larger, I gave a fifty pound
bag of rise… I was told that a well-finished rai, about four feet in diameter, is the price
usually paid either to the parents or to the headman of the village as a compensation of the
theft of a mispil [a woman].
In	terms	of	recording	the	of	ownership	changes	of	these	unwieldy	pieces,
Tharngan	comments:
There’s no problem in knowing who owns which piece because all the pieces next to a
dwelling tend to belong to that house. All those which are found on dancing grounds—their
ownership does shift from time to time, but the shift is always done publicly in front of chiefs
or elders, so everyone remembers what belongs to whom.
There	is	also	the	case	of	a	large	stone	that	was	lost	at	sea,	recorded	by
Furness	who	heard	the	legend	recounted	by	a	local	fortune	teller	and
exorcist.	The	fortune	teller	told	Furness	that	a	few	generations	ago	a	large
stone	was	lost	at	sea,	and	even	though	it	is	not	physically	present	and	no
one	can	see	it,	claims	on	the	stone	continue	to	have	value.
one	can	see	it,	claims	on	the	stone	continue	to	have	value.
This	particular	Rai	stone	is	used	by	some	economists	as	an	example	of
fiat	money	existing	in	primitive	societies.	However,	Dror	Goldberg	argues
in	a	2005	paper,	
Famous	Myths	of	Fiat	Money
39
	that	this	is	not	fiat.
There	was	no	evidence	of	this	stone	being	used	in	trade,	as	ownership
remained	in	the	family,	and	the	value	of	the	lost	stone	was	agreed	by	the
community,	not	by	any	legal	decree.	Goldberg	argues	that	Rai	stones	have
legal,	historical,	religious,	aesthetic,	and	sentimental	value,	and	are
therefore	not	fiat,	and	furthermore,	there	are	no	good	examples	of	fiat
money	existing	in	primitive	societies.
1913:	Birth	of	the	US	Federal	Reserve
	
System
In	1913,	the	Federal	Reserve	Act	was	passed	into	law	in	the	USA.	This
created	the	Federal	Reserve	System,	the	central	banking	system	of	the
USA.	The	act	was	drafted	by	influential	commercial	bankers	and	gave	the
central	bank	the	monopoly	on	the	price	and	quantity	of	money,	and	had
the	mandate	to	maximise	employment	and	ensure	price	stability.	The
system	has	public	and	private	sector	components,	and	the	regional
Federal	Reserve	Banks	are	owned	by	large	US	private	banks.	The	Federal
Reserve	is	discussed	in	greater	detail	in	the	Appendix.
The	US	dollar	remained	on	a	gold	standard	for	a	period	of	time	under	the
Federal	Reserve	System,	as	we	will	see	in	the	section	about	gold
standards.
1999:	The
	
Euro
On	1	Jan	1999,	the	Euro	officially	became	the	currency	of	the	member
states	of	the	European	Union:	Belgium,	Germany,	Spain,	France,	Ireland,
Italy,	Luxembourg,	the	Netherlands,	Austria,	Portugal,	and	Finland.	Euro
notes	and	coins	came	into	circulation	in	2002.	The	currency	is	now	the
official	currency	of	nineteen	of	the	current	twenty-eight	EU	states,	six
official	currency	of	nineteen	of	the	current	twenty-eight	EU	states,	six
non-EU	jurisdictions,	and	a	number	of	other	non-sovereign	entities.
2009:	Bitcoin!
On	3	January	2009,	the	first	Bitcoin	was	brought,	or	‘mined,’	into
existence.	How	does	Bitcoin	relate	to	money?	We’ll	discuss	Bitcoin	in	a
lot	more	depth	later	on,	but	it	was	first	commonly	described	as	a
‘cryptocurrency’.	And	simply	because	of	the	word	‘currency’	people	start
thinking…	
Is	it	money?	Does	it	fulfil	the	traditional	three	functions	of
money?	What	is	money	anyway?	Does	Bitcoin
	
count?
Defining	Bitcoin	is	a	popular	activity	for	regulators	and	policymakers	who
need	to	determine	if	bitcoins	fall	under	their	purview	or	not.	I	suspect
things	would	have	worked	out	differently	had	Bitcoin	been	originally
described	as	a	‘cryptocommodity’	or	a	‘cryptoasset’.	It	turns	out	that
Bitcoin	is	hard	to	shoehorn	into	existing	categories,	so	perhaps	it,	along
with	other	crypto-things,	belongs	in	a	new	asset	class.
That	fact	is,	for	our	purposes,	the	definition	of	Bitcoin	doesn’t	matter.	It
doesn’t	matter	how	you	define	money,	it	doesn’t	matter	it	Bitcoin	fits	the
bill	or	not.	Bitcoin	has	some	properties	that	make	it	appear	from	one
angle	like	money,	and	from	another	angle	like	a	commodity	such	as	gold.
Money	is	in	the	eye	of	the	beholder.	Nowadays,	we	have	so	many	different
forms	of	money,	all	with	slightly	different	characteristics	and	trade-offs,
that	Bitcoin	and	its	siblings	can,	and	will,	sit	alongside	the	other	forms.
Good	Enough
	
Money
I	like	to	use	the	concept	of	‘good	enough	money’.	If	the	money	you	want
to	use	is	good	enough	for	your	purposes,	then	that	is	ok.	For	example,
when	I	borrow	cash	from	my	colleagues	to	buy	my	lunch,	sometimes	I
pay	them	back	in	
Grab
	
credits
.
Grab	is	a	ride-hailing	app	similar	to	Uber,	but	localized	for	Asia,	and	it
also	has	a	wallet	function	which	you	top	up	with	your	credit	or	debit	card.
The	credits	are	denominated	in	local	currency	and	can	be	used	to	pay	for
journeys,	sent	to	other	users,	or	used	to	pay	for	goods	in	some	shops.
Some	of	my	colleagues	use	Grab	for	their	taxis,	so	paying	them	back	in
Grab	credits	is	fine	for	me	and	fine	for	them.	So,	Grab	credits	are	‘good
enough	money’	as	far	as	we	are	concerned	for	that	particular	small
denomination	use.	But	I	wouldn’t	buy	a	house	with	Grab	credits,	nor
would	a	company	settle	a	large	invoice	with	it.	It	wouldn’t	be	‘good
enough	money’	in	those	situations.
It	seems	that	people	and	companies	will	accept	a	wide	range	of	forms	of
money	so	long	as	they	can	do	
the	next	thing
	with	it—whether	that	is
paying	for	a	taxi,	settling	invoices,	or	saving	it	for	long	term	value
appreciation.
Gold Standards
Some	people	talk	about	The	Gold	Standard.	In	fact,	there	is	no	such	thing
as	
the
	gold	standard.	There	are	a	few	
types
	of	gold	standard:
1.
Gold	specie	standard.
	Coins	are	made	of	gold	and	are	a	certain
weight	and	purity	in	convenient	standard	units	instead	of	random
shapes,	sizes,	and	weights.	This	is	called	a	
gold	specie	standard
.
Specie	is	a	Latin	word	for	‘the	actual	form’.	This	is	commodity
money.
2.
Gold	bullion	standard.
	Notes	(bits	of	paper)	are	redeemable	or
convertible
	at	the	issuer	(usually	the	central	bank)	for	gold—usually
in	the	form	of	gold	bullion	(this	means	bars	of	gold	of	certain
standard	weights	and	purities).	This	is	called	a	
gold	bullion
standard
.	This	is	representative	money.
3.
Non-convertible	gold	bullion	standard.
	This	is	where	the
issuer	declares	that	their	currency	is	worth	a	certain	amount	of	gold,
but	doesn’t	allow	you	to	redeem	your	money	for	gold.	This	is	starting
to	blur	the	lines	between	representative	and	fiat	money.
When	people	talk	about	the	gold	standard,	they	usually	mean	a	
gold
bullion	standard
	where	a	note	represents	some	defined	amount	of	gold
and	can	be	redeemed	for	it.	The	issuer	of	the	currency,	usually	a	central
bank,	pegs	their	currency	to	a	fixed	weight	in	pure	or	fine	gold	and	tells
the	world	that	they	will	exchange	one	unit	of	currency	for	a	certain
amount	of	gold	stored	in	their	vaults.	This	is	a	currency	peg,	which	we
discussed	earlier,	and	means	they	need	to	have	the	gold	in	their	vaults	in
order	to	remain	credible	
and
	promise	to	let	people	redeem	their	notes	for
gold.	The	amount	of	gold	you	have	in	your	vaults	is	largely	irrelevant	if
you	don’t	let	people	redeem	their	notes.
When	a	few	countries	adopt	a	gold	standard,	the	exchange	rates	between
their	respective	currencies	become	effectively	pegged.	In	theory,	you	can
always	sell	one	currency	for	gold,	and	then	buy	a	known	amount	of
another	‘gold	standard’	currency	with	it.	So	the	gold	peg	rates	also
determine	the	currency-to-currency	exchange	rates.	Before	the	First
World	War,	the	effective	exchange	rate	between	the	US	dollar	and	the
pound	sterling	was	$4.8665	to	£1	because	both	currencies	were	on	a	gold
standard.	Of	course,	there	are	costs	and	risks	involved	in	the	transactions
and	the	storage	and	transport	of	the	gold,	so	that	is	why	it	is	an	
effective
peg	with	some	wiggle	room,	rather	than	an	absolute	peg.
Before	we	look	at	an	example	of	a	gold	standard,	let’s	clear	up	some
terminology.	Gold	and	silver	are	measured	by	weight	(or	mass,	to	be
pedantic).	The	units	are	
grains
	and	
troy	ounces
.	There	are	480	grains	to
one	troy	ounce,	and	twelve	troy	ounces	to	one	troy	pound.	In	standard
terms,	this	means	one	troy	ounce	is	31.10	grams,	which	is	about	10%
heavier	than	one	‘normal’	(or	
avoirdupois
)	ounce	of	28.35	grams.	Old
habits	die	hard—the	troy	ounce	is	still	the	measure	used	today	when
pricing	gold	and	other	precious	metals.
The small golden disk close to the 5 cm marker is a piece of pure gold weighing one
troy grain. Source: Wikipedia

Gold	Standards	in	the	USA
Although	many	countries	have	attempted	to	peg	their	currencies	to	gold,
the	USA	has	had	an	interesting	history.	According	to	
Brief	History	of	the
Gold	Standard	in	the	United	States
41
	published	by	the	Congressional
Research	Service,	the	USA	went	through	a	number	of	periods	with
multiple	attempts	at	pegging	the	US	dollar	to	gold.	They	all	eventually
failed.	Let’s	look	at	what	happened.
1792
–
1834—Bimetallic	specie	standard:
	Standardised	gold	coins
($10	eagles,	and	$2.50	quarter-eagles)	and	silver	coins	existed,	minted	by
the	government.	The	definition	of	one	dollar	was	based	on	a	certain
weight	of	silver	or	a	certain	weight	of	gold	which	valued	the	metals	in	the
ratio	15:1.	World	markets	valued	gold	a	little	more	than	implied	by	the
USA’s	peg,	so	gold	coins	left	the	USA,	leaving	the	USA	mainly	using	silver
coins.
1834
–
1862—Silver	flees	the	USA:
	The	USA	changed	their	ratio	to
16:1	by	minting	the	gold	coins	with	slightly	less	gold.	World	markets	now
silver	a	little	more	than	implied	by	this	new	ratio.	Thus,	the	silver	coins
left	the	USA,	leaving	the	USA	mainly	using	the	new,	less-goldy	gold	coins.
It	is	hard	to	peg	things	that	trade	in	markets	abroad!
1862—Civil	War	chaos	and	fiat	paper	money:
	The	USA
government	issued	notes	called	‘greenbacks’.	Greenbacks	were	notes	that
were	declared	as	legal	tender,	but	were	not	convertible	into	gold	or	silver.
This	took	the	USA	off	any	metallic	standard	and	onto	fiat	paper	money.
The	dollar	lost	value	in	the	marketplace,	and	people	preferred	to	hold
23.22	grains	of	gold	more	than	one	dollar.
1879
–
1933—A	true	gold	standard:
	A	dollar	was	re-defined	in	terms
of	the	pre-war	weight	of	gold	(but	not	silver)	at	$20.67	per	troy	ounce.
The	treasury	issued	gold	coins	and	convertible	(redeemable)	gold	notes,
and	greenbacks	were	once	again	redeemable	in	gold.	The	Federal	Reserve
System	was	created	in	1913.
Allow	me	to	digress	just	for	a	bit	of	fun.	This	was	a	difficult	political
period	that	coincided	with	the	birth	of	populism	in	the	US.	Indeed,	L.
Frank	Baum’s	book	
The	Wonderful	Wizard	of	Oz
	is	regarded	by	some	as
a	clever	political	satire,	a	parable	on	populism,	and	a	commentary	on
monetary	policy.	References	are	numerous.	Yellow	brick	road?	Gold.
Ruby	slippers?	In	the	book,	they	were	silver,	and	a	reference	to	a	populist
demand	for	‘free	and	unlimited	coinage	of	silver	and	gold’	at	the	16:1
ratio.	Scarecrow?	Farmers	who	weren’t	as	dim	as	first	thought.	Tin	Man?
Industrial	workers.	Flying	monkeys?	Plains	Indians.	The	Cowardly	Lion?
William	Jennings	Bryan,	Nebraska	representative	in	Congress	and	later
the	democratic	presidential	candidate.	Emerald	City,	where	the	Wizard
lives?	Washington	DC.	The	Wizard,	an	old	man	whose	power	is	achieved
through	acts	of	deception?	Well,	pick	any	politician	in	Washington.	Now
can	you	guess	what	‘Oz’	is	a	reference	to?	Yes,	the	unit	for	precious
metals.	These	parallels	are	discussed	in	more	detail	by	Quentin	P.	Taylor,
Professor	of	History,	Rogers	State	College	in	a	fascinating	essay	“Money
and	Politics	in	the	Land	of	Oz.”
42
1934–1973:	The	New	Deal	and	the	end	of	the	true	gold
standard
.	The	1934	Gold	Reserve	Act	devalued	the	dollar	from	$20.67
to	$35	per	troy	ounce,	and	ended	convertibility	for	citizens.	‘The	free
circulation	of	gold	coins	is	unnecessary,’	President	Franklin	Roosevelt
told	Congress,	insisting	that	the	transfer	of	gold	‘is	essential	only	for	the
payment	of	international	trade	balances’.	The	Gold	Reserve	Act	outlawed
most	private	possession	of	gold,	forcing	individuals	to	sell	it	to	the
treasury.	Those	found	hoarding	gold	in	coin	or	bullion	could	be	punished
by	a	fine	of	up	to	$10,000	and/or	jail	time.	According	to	Wikipedia
43
:
A year earlier, in 1933, Executive Order 6102 had made it a criminal offense for U.S. citizens to
own or trade gold anywhere in the world, with exceptions for some jewellery and collector’s
coins. These prohibitions were relaxed starting in 1964—gold certificates were again allowed
for private investors on April 24, 1964, although the obligation to pay the certificate holder
on demand in gold specie would not be honored. By 1975 Americans could again freely own
and trade gold.
This	quasi-gold	standard	was	maintained	under	the	Bretton	Woods
international	monetary	agreement	of	1944.	The	Bretton	Woods
agreement	is	explained	in	greater	detail	later.
1971:
	The	Nixon	administration	stopped	freely	converting	dollars	at	their
official	exchange	rate	of	$35	per	troy	ounce.	This	effectively	ended	the
Bretton	Woods	agreement.
1972:
	The	dollar	was	devalued	from	$35	to	$38	per	troy	ounce.
1973:
	The	dollar	was	devalued	from	$38	to	$42.22	per	troy	ounce.
1974
:	President	Gerald	Ford	permitted	private	gold	ownership	again	in
the	USA.
1976:
	The	gold	standard	was	abandoned	in	the	USA:	The	US	dollar
became	pure	fiat	money.
So	people	talk	about	the	gold	standard,	but	let’s	be	realistic:	It	is	not
really	a	gold	standard	if	(a)	people	can’t	redeem	their	dollars	for	gold,	and
(b)	you	keep	changing	the	rate.	It	turns	out	that	implementing	a	gold
standard	is	difficult,	even	if	you	can	put	people	in	prison	for	owning	gold!
Fiat Currency and Intrinsic Value
‘Yes,	but	Bitcoin	has	no	
intrinsic
	value,’	is	a	comment	I	hear	a	lot	from
people	trying	to	understand	why	Bitcoin	has	a	price.	However,	it	is	not	a
very	good	argument	against	Bitcoin.	Fiat	currencies—USD,	GBP,	EUR,
etc—have	no	intrinsic	value	either.	In	fact,	fiat	currencies	are	
defined
	by
not	having	intrinsic	value.
That	is	worth	repeating.	
Fiat	currency	has	no	intrinsic
	
value
.
But	that	is	ok!	On	the	European	Central	Bank’s	(ECB)	website
44
	you	can
read:
Euro banknotes and coins are money but so is the balance on a bank account. What actually is
money? How is it created and what is the ECB’s role?
The changing essence of money
The nature of money has evolved over time. Early money was usually commodity money—an
object made of something that had a market value, such as a gold coin. Later on,
representative money consisted of banknotes that could be swapped against a certain
amount of gold or silver. Modern economies, including the Euro area, are based on fiat
money. This is money that is declared legal tender and issued by a central bank but, unlike
representative money, cannot be converted into, for example, a fixed weight of gold. 
It has no
intrinsic value—the paper used for banknotes is in principle worthless—
yet is still
accepted in exchange for goods and services because people trust the central bank to keep the
value of money stable over time. If central banks were to fail in this endeavour, fiat money
would lose its general acceptability as a medium of exchange and its attractiveness as a store
of value.
The	St	Louis	Fed,	in	episode	nine	of	a	podcast	series	called	
Functions	of
Money—The	Economic	Lowdown	Podcast	Series
,	says:
Fiat money is money that does not have intrinsic value and does not represent an asset in a
vault somewhere. Its value comes from being declared ‘legal tender’—an acceptable form of
payment—by the government of the issuing country.
So	next	time	someone	brings	up	intrinsic	value,	try	to	be	patient	and
explain	that	intrinsic	value	doesn’t	really	matter.	What	matters	is	if	there
is	
utility
	in	the	asset.	How	useful	is	it?	Well,	fiat	currency	is	useful,	at	the
very	least	because	it	is	the	settlement	instrument	with	which	you	pay	your
taxes	to	the	state,	and	more	broadly	because	it	is	legal	tender	and	must	be
accepted	by	merchants.
If	you	don’t	pay	your	taxes	you	go	to	prison,	or	worse.	So	some	people
argue	that	fiat	currency	is	backed	by	the	threat	of	state	violence.	Other
people	say	that	fiat	currency	is	backed	by	the	trust	and	confidence	in	state
institutions—which	is	a	
little
	bit	vague,	don’t	you	think?	But	at	least	it
sort	of	makes	sense,	unlike	the	cryptocurrency	favourite:	‘Bitcoin	is
backed	by	math’—which	is	entirely	nonsensical.	Although	at	first	it
sounds	kind	of	profound,	don’t	stop	to	think	about	what	that	means.
Mathematics	is	used	to	determine	which	transactions	are	valid	or	not,
and	is	used	to	control	the	speed	at	which	bitcoins	are	created,	but	this	is
not	a	‘backing’	in	the	sense	that	a	bond	is	backed	by	the	issuing	company,
or	a	US	dollar	is	backed	by	the	assets	on	the	Federal	Reserve’s	balance
sheet,	or	a	startup	is	backed	by	a	venture	capitalist.
Legal	Tender
When	a	currency	is	declared	legal	tender,	it	means	that	by	statute	(law),
people	must	accept	it	as	a	settlement	mechanism	to	meet	a	financial
obligation,	and	that	you	can	pay	your	tax	bills	with	it
45
.
Not	all	notes	and	coins	are	legal	tender	in	all	circumstances.	Currencies
are,	in	general,	not	legal	tender	outside	of	their	home	jurisdiction.	For
example,	someone	in	the	UK	can	refuse	to	accept	Russian	roubles	as
repayment	of	a	debt.	This	doesn’t	stop	a	recipient	accepting	roubles	if
they	want;	it	just	stops	someone	being	able	to	force	a	recipient	to	accept
them.
Also,	in	many	countries	you	can’t	force	a	recipient	to	accept	payment	in
an	antisocial	amount	of	loose	change:	there	are	specific	rules	as	to	what
counts	as	legal	tender.	In	Singapore,	according	to	the	2002	Currency
Act
46
,	you	can’t	force	someone	to	accept	more	than	$2	in	any	combination
of	5c,	10c,	20c	coins,	and	you	can’t	force	someone	to	accept	more	than
$10	in	50c	coins.	Currently	there	are	no	limits	for	payment	in	one	dollar
coins,	but	after	a	series	of	high	profile	incidents	in	2014	where	people	and
merchants	made	payments	in	large	amounts	of	loose	change
47
,	the
Currency	Act	is	being	reconsidered	to	a	more	memorable	uniform	legal
tender	limit	of	ten	coins	per	denomination,	across	all	denominations,	per
transaction.	This	means	that	a	payer	would	legally	be	able	to	use	up	to	ten
pieces	each	of	5-cent,	10c,	20c,	50c,	and	one	dollar	coins,	but	no	more,
per	transaction.
Also	in	Singapore,	under	the	1967	Currency	Interchangeability
Agreement,	the	Brunei	dollar	is	acceptable	as	‘customary	tender’	on	a	1:1
basis.	You	can	pay	for	a	coffee	in	Singapore	by	handing	over	the	same
amount	in	Brunei	dollars.	Banks	in	each	country	will	accept	the	other
currency	at	par
48
.
Zimbabwe	uses	USD	as	the	main	currency	for	pricing	goods	and	for
government	transactions,	but	lists	the	following	currencies	as	legal
tender:	Euro,	United	States	dollar,	Pound	sterling,	South	African	rand,
Botswana	pula,	Australian	dollar,	Chinese	yuan,	and	Japanese	yen.	Its
own	currency,	the	Zimbabwe	dollar,	is	not	on	that	list.	There	are	also
multiple	versions	of	the	Zimbabwe	dollar	(with	different	pricing)	and	the
country	is	a	fascinating	case	study	for	how	not	to	do	currency.	It	is	a	mess
for	shopkeepers,	but	a	delight	for	monetary	economists!
Currency Pegs
A	
currency	peg
	is	when	someone	in	charge	declares	that	one	currency	is
worth	a	fixed	amount	of	another	currency	and	then	attempts	to	maintain
that	exchange	rate	by	matching	the	supply	of	either	currency	with	the
demand.	If	people	think	that	you	have	got	your	peg	wrong,	a	black	market
can	emerge	where	people	trade	the	currencies	at	what	they	perceive	to	be
a	more	accurate	exchange	rate.
How	do	you	maintain	a	peg?	Firstly,	you	threaten.	You	announce	the
pegged	rate,	and	then	declare	penalties	for	people	found	deviating	from
it.	This	may	mean	fines,	prison,	or	perhaps	something	worse.	But	you
also	need	to	be	credible	and	try	to	prevent	black	markets	from	emerging.
Credibility	comes	from	having	enough	of	both	currencies	to	match
whatever	a	trader	might	want	to	exchange.
For	example,	let’s	say	you	are	the	king	of	a	country	and	you	declare	a	peg
of	one	apple	=	one	orange.	If	one	year	for	whatever	reason	people	really
want	apples,	the	demand	for	apples	will	exceed	the	demand	for	oranges.
So	people	might	be	prepared	to	pay	two	oranges	for	one	apple.	But	you’ve
declared	a	peg,	so	everyone	will	come	to	you	with	the	oranges	that	they
declared	a	peg,	so	everyone	will	come	to	you	with	the	oranges	that	they
don’t	want	and	demand	one	apple	for	each	orange	they	bring	you.	So	to
keep	the	peg,	you	better	have	a	lot	of	apples	to	give	out.	If	you	don’t	have
them,	then	a	black	market	will	emerge	that	excludes	you,	and	people	will
start	trading	one	apple	for	more	than	one	orange,	making	a	mockery	of
your	peg.	So	you	need	to	have	at	least	as	many	apples	in	reserve	as	there
are	oranges	in	circulation.
And	vice	versa.	If,	on	the	other	hand,	people	really	want	oranges,	you’re
going	to	need	a	lot	of	oranges	to	hand	out,	and	you’ll	be	receiving	apples
(which	no	one	wants)	in	return.
So	to	maintain	a	peg	to	the	very	end,	you	need	as	many	apples	in	reserve
as	there	are	oranges	in	circulation,	and	you	need	as	many	oranges	in
reserve	as	there	are	apples	in	circulation.	Or	in	the	fiat	world,	you	need	to
back	your	fiat	currency	100%	with	the	currency	you	are	pegging	to,	at	the
peg	rate—an	arrangement	known	as	a	‘currency	board’.
While	central	banks	can	prevent	their	currencies	from	going	up	in	value
by	creating	as	much	fiat	currency	as	they	want	and	therefore	capping	the
value	of	their	currency,	it	is	harder	for	them	to	prevent	their	currencies
from	going	down	in	value,	because	they	need	other	currencies	with	which
to	buy	their	own	currency	back	in	order	to	prop	its	price	up.
This	is	essentially	how	George	Soros	broke	the	Bank	of	England:	He	had
more	ammo	than	the	Bank.
George	Soros	and	the	Bank	of	England
Rohin	Dhar	details	the	story	on	priceonomics.com
49
:	in	October	1990,	the
Bank	of	England	joined	the	European	Exchange	Rate	Mechanism	(ERM)
and	committed	to	keep	the	exchange	rate	of	Deutsche	marks	and	pounds
sterling	to	between	2.78	and	3.13	marks	per	pound.	By	1992,	it	had
become	obvious	to	the	market	that	sterling	was	valued	too	highly,	even	at
the	floor	of	2.78	marks	per	pound,	and	the	real	price	of	sterling	should
have	been	lower.
In	the	months	leading	up	to	September	1992,	Soros,	via	his	Quantum
hedge	fund,	borrowed	pounds	from	anyone	he	could,	and	sold	them	to
anyone	who	would	buy	them.	Borrowing	something	to	sell	it	with	an
intention	to	buy	it	back	later	as	a	lower	price	is	known	as	‘going	short’.
According	to	an	article	in	
The	Atlantic
50
,	Soros	built	up	a	short	position	of
$1.5bn	worth	of	pounds.	On	the	night	of	Tuesday,	15	September,	the	fund
accelerated	its	bet	and	sold	more,	extending	the	fund’s	short	position
from	$1.5bn	worth	to	$10bn	worth,	and	pushing	the	price	of	sterling
lower	and	lower	overnight	while	the	Bank	of	England	was	absent	from
the	markets.
The	following	morning,	the	Bank	of	England	had	to	buy	sterling	in	order
to	prop	up	the	value	of	the	pound	and	maintain	the	peg	they	committed
to.	But	what	can	the	Bank	of	England	buy	pounds	with?	Their	reserves—
other	currencies	or	borrowed	money.	The	Bank	of	England	announced
that	they	would	borrow	up	to	$15bn	in	order	to	buy	pounds.	And	Soros
was	prepared	to	sell	that	amount	to	neutralise	the	demand	created	by	the
Bank	of	England…	it	was	a	game	of	brinkmanship.	So,	the	Bank	bought
£1bn	of	sterling	over	several	batches,	and	raised	short	term	interest	rates
by	two	percentage	points	to	make	Soros’	loans	expensive	(remember,
Soros	was	borrowing	sterling	in	order	to	sell	it,	and	had	to	pay	interest	on
the	pounds	he	was	borrowing).	But	it	was	too	late.	The	markets	didn’t
react,	and	the	price	of	sterling	didn’t	rise.	At	7.30pm	that	evening	the
Bank	of	England	was	forced	to	exit	from	the	ERM	and	let	sterling	float.
Over	the	next	month	the	price	of	sterling	fell	from	2.78	marks	to	2.40
marks	per	pound.	That	critical	Wednesday	was	known	as	Black
Wednesday,	and	Soros	became	known	as	the	man	who	broke	the	Bank	of
England.
Bretton	Woods
The	Bretton	Woods	meeting	was	all	about	currency	pegs.	On	1	July	1944,
during	World	War	II,	delegates	from	forty-four	countries	met	in	Bretton
Woods,	New	Hampshire,	USA,	for	twenty-one	days	of	discussion	to
normalise	commercial	and	financial	relations.
The	outcome	was	a	kind	of	international	gold	standard	agreement	where
the	US	dollar	was	pegged	to	gold	at	$35	per	troy	ounce	and	other
currencies	were	pegged	to	the	dollar	(with	1%	wiggle	room)	and	could	be
redeemed	for	gold	at	the	US	Treasury.	The	International	Monetary	Fund
was	established,	as	was	the	International	Bank	for	Reconstruction	and
Development	(IBRD,	which	would	eventually	become	part	of	the	World
Bank).	At	that	time,	ordinary	Americans	were	still	banned	from	owning
non-jewellery	gold.
Prior	to	this,	in	1931	Britain,	most	of	the	Commonwealth,	except	Canada,
and	many	other	countries	had	abandoned	the	gold	standard.	Bretton
Woods	therefore	marked	a	return	to	some	kind	of	gold	standard.
The	Bretton	Woods	Agreement	didn’t	work	very	well.	Countries
frequently	devalued	their	currencies	with	respect	to	the	dollar	and	gold.
For	example,	in	1949,	Britain	devalued	the	pound	by	about	30%	from
$4.30	to	$2.80,	and	many	other	countries	followed	suit.
In	1971	the	Bretton	Woods	agreement	broke	down	after	the	US	stopped
honouring	the	convertibility	of	dollars	to	gold.	This	coincided	with	a	big
drop	in	US	gold	reserves	and	increase	in	foreign	claims	on	US	dollars.
Quantitative Easing
Quantitative	Easing	(QE)	often	comes	up	in	conversations	about	fiat
currencies,	and	people	describe	it	as	‘printing	money,’	but	it	is	not	that
currencies,	and	people	describe	it	as	‘printing	money,’	but	it	is	not	that
simple.	QE	is	a	euphemism	for	an	issuing	authority	(generally	a	central
bank)	increasing	the	amount	of	fiat	money	in	circulation	in	order	to
stimulate	a	flagging	economy.	So	people	worry	that	this	additional	money
‘dilutes’	the	value	of	existing	money,	and	this	makes	people	worry	about
the	sustainability	of	the	fiat	system.
‘Printing	money’	is	a	poor	description	for	QE.	Think	about	it—if	the
central	bank	really	‘printed	money’	whether	physically	or	digitally,	who
would	it	give	it	to,	and	how?
So	how	does	QE	work?	The	central	bank	buys	assets,	usually	bonds,	from
the	private	sector	(commercial	banks,	asset	managers,	hedge	funds,	etc)
in	the	secondary	market.	These	are	bonds	that	have	already	been	issued
and	are	now	traded	by	financial	market	participants.	Central	banks
broadly	think	of	the	private	sector	as	having	a	balance	of	two	things:
money,	and	non-money	(other	financial	assets).	And	central	banks	can,	to
some	extent,	control	that	balance	by	buying	financial	assets	from	the
private	sector	to	add	money,	or	by	selling	financial	assets	to	the	private
sector	to	remove	money.
Why	bonds?	Because	we	take	comfort	that	our	central	banks	only	own
safe	assets,	and	bonds	are	generally	regarded	as	safe—or	at	least	
safer
than	other	financial	instruments.	Their	value	is	also	affected	by	interest
rates,	something	that	a	central	bank	has	some	degree	of	control	over.
Who	can	central	banks	buy	bonds	from?	Certainly	not	you	or	me	directly
because	we	don’t	have	that	kind	of	relationship	with	central	banks.	As	we
will	see	in	the	next	section,	central	banks	have	financial	relationships
with	certain	commercial	banks	called	clearing	banks,	who	have	accounts
called	reserve	accounts	with	the	central	bank.	So	central	banks	buy	bonds
from	clearing	banks,	and	they	pay	by	crediting	the	banks’	reserve	account
with	new	money.	Clearing	banks	can	also	act	as	an	agent	for	other
with	new	money.	Clearing	banks	can	also	act	as	an	agent	for	other
bondholders	who	wish	to	sell	bonds	to	the	central	bank	through	the
clearing	banks.
Central	banks	start	the	QE	journey	by	buying	government	bonds	(US
treasuries,	etc)	because	they	are	considered	the	least	risky	bonds.	When
they	run	out	of	those	to	buy,	they	then	move	to	more	risky	bonds,	such	as
those	issued	by	corporations.	The	problem	is	that	the	central	bank	ends
up	with	a	bunch	of	risky	bonds	on	its	balance	sheet—and	remember	that,
from	a	balance	sheet	perspective,	it	is	the	bonds	that	‘back’	the	currency.
There	are	two	worries	with	QE:
1.
With	excessive	QE,	the	value	of	money	will	go	down	as	there	is	more
of	it	sloshing	around	in	the	private	sector,	which	is	not	great	for
savers,	and	could	also	cause	price	inflation	(though	we	haven’t	seen
this	yet).
2.
A	central	bank	owns	risky	financial	assets	that	could	go	down	in
value,	damaging	the	central	bank’s	balance	sheet	when	the	value	of
the	assets	it	owns	falls.
We	can	see	the	impact	that	QE	has	had	on	central	bank	balance	sheets
since	the	most	recent	global	financial	crisis:

Summary
The	history	of	money	is	characterised	by	its	failures.	Inflation,	dilution,
debasement,	clipping,	re-coining,	and	creation	of	new	tokens	worth	less
and	less	all	appear	frequently.	The	theme	with	money	seems	to	be	that
whatever	form	it	takes,	it	gets	watered	down	either	through	debasement
or	by	excessive	creation	until	a	certain	limit,	then	there	is	a	reform.
The	rate	of	monetary	debasement	seems	to	have	increased,	and	the	latest
experiment	in	debasing	is	that	of	QE.	Currency	pegs	are	difficult	to
manage	unless	backed	100%	with	reserves,	and	although	they	can	be
successful	for	some	time,	they	mostly	eventually	fail.
successful	for	some	time,	they	mostly	eventually	fail.
Is	fiat	currency	the	best	solution	to	money?	Will	fiat	money,	backed	by
the	full	faith	and	confidence	that	people	have	in	today’s	governments,
continue	to	survive?	Who	knows.	Some	believe	that	we	have	some	new
challengers	in	the	form	of	cryptocurrencies.	The	narrative	from
policymakers	has	shifted	from	ignoring	cryptocurrencies,	to	stating	that
they	are	not	a	threat	to	economic	stability,	to	discussing	a	potential
threat.	A	chapter	in	the	BIS	Annual	Economic	Report
52
	published	by	the
Bank	of	International	Settlements	in	Jun	2018	reads:
A third, longer-term challenge concerns the stability of the financial system. It remains to be
seen whether widespread use of cryptocurrencies and related self-executing financial
products will give rise to new financial vulnerabilities and systemic risks. Close monitoring of
developments will be required.
Although	we	have	arguably	better	tools	and	technology	now	than	at	any
previous	point	in	time,	humans	are	still	humans	and	will	still	do	what
they	can	to	gain,	and	hold	on	to	power	and	wealth—often	making	the
same	mistakes	as	their	predecessors.


Part 2
DIGITAL
	
MONEY
It	is	worth	understanding	how	digital	money	is	currently	used	to	settle
debts.	In	my	career,	I	have	spent	time	with	people	with	a	wide	range	of
experience,	from	new	graduates	through	to	seasoned	professionals	who
wear	ties	and	work	in	banks	and	management	consultancies,	yet	I	rarely
come	across	people	who	really	understand	how	a	payment	is	made,	and
who	can	articulate	clearly	how	money	moves	around	the	financial	system.
How Are Interbank Payments Made?
Banks	need	to	pay	each	other	all	the	time,	sometimes	because	a	customer
has	instructed	the	bank	to	make	a	payment	on	their	behalf,	sometimes
because	a	bank	needs	to	pay	another	bank	as	a	result	of	its	own	trading	or
lending	activity.	Here	we	are	going	to	look	at	the	bank	to	bank	payment
that	arises	when	a	customer	wishes	to	make	a	payment	to	someone	else
who	banks	elsewhere.
We	easily	understand	
physical
	payments	that	are	made	directly	when	you
pay	in	cash	for	something	without	a	third-party	intermediary.	This	can	be
described	as	‘peer-to-peer’	as	you	simply	hand	over	cash	to	the	other
person.	There’s	no	one	in	the	middle,	you	don’t	need	to	instruct	or	pay	a
third	party,	and	no	one	can	stop	the	payment.	The	cash	payment	is	also
resistant	to	censorship.	If	you	are	the	recipient,	you	can	be	reasonably
confident,	upon	inspection,	that	the	banknote	or	coins	are	unique	(i.e.,
not	counterfeit	copies),	otherwise	you	should	not	accept	them	and	there
is	no	transaction.	It	is	also	obvious	that	the	payer	hasn’t	spent	that	same
cash	already	(else	they	wouldn’t	have	it	to	give	to	you),	and	furthermore,
they	can’t	use	the	same	cash	to	simultaneously	pay	you	and	someone	else
(because	physical	cash	can’t	exist	in	two	places	at	once).	Of	course—this
is	all	intuitive.
As	soon	as	you	move	into	the	digital	world,	things	become	a	little	more
complex.	Digital	assets	are	easy	to	copy.	Unlike	physical	cash	you	can’t
give	a	digital	asset	(e.g.,	a	file)	to	someone	as	a	currency	payment.	Well,
you	can,	but	they	won’t	value	it	because	they	can’t	tell	if	it	is	unique.	They
can’t	be	sure	that	you	will	delete	it	once	you	have	sent	it	to	them,	and	they
can’t	tell	if	you	have	sent,	or	will	send,	a	copy	of	the	file	to	a	different
person
53
.	This	problem	with	digital	assets	is	called	the	‘double	spend’
problem.
Wikipedia
54
	describes	double	spending	as:
…a potential flaw in a 
digital cash
 scheme in which the same single digital token can be spent
more than once. This is possible because a digital token consists of a digital file that can be
duplicated or falsified.
The	digital	money	world	deals	with	this	by	using	a	bookkeeper	who	is	an
independent	third	party,	who,	because	they	are	regulated,	can	be	trusted
to	maintain	accurate	books	and	records	and	abide	by	certain	rules.	For
example,	you	trust	that	PayPal	is	not	creating	PayPal	dollars	out	of	thin
air	because	each	PayPal	balance	must	be	backed	by	an	equivalent	balance
in	its	bank,	and	you	trust	that	the	regulators	will	do	their	job	and	shut
PayPal	down	if	they	are	not	behaving.	You	also	trust	that	when	you
instruct	your	bank	to	make	a	payment,	the	amount	of	money	leaving	your
account	is	the	same	as	the	amount	that	is	entering	the	recipient’s	account
(less	fees,	of	course).
So,	with	any	form	of	digital	asset,	you	need	a	trusted	bookkeeper	to
maintain	a	list	of	who	owns	what	and	who	plays	by	some	well	understood
and	trusted	rules.	They	often	have	a	licence	from	an	authority	that	gives
them	some	credibility	and	increases	your	confidence	that	they	are
carrying	out	their	activities	according	to	certain	standards.
Now,	let’s	dive	into	how	the	movement	of	bits	and	bytes	and	debits	and
credits	produces	the	effect	of	money	moving	instantly	from	one	person	to
credits	produces	the	effect	of	money	moving	instantly	from	one	person	to
another.
How	are	Payments
	
Made?
How	does	digital	money	move	from	one	bank	account	to	another?	When
Alice	wants	to	pay	$10	to	Bob,	does	Alice’s	bank	simply	subtract	$10	from
her	account	and	tell	Bob’s	bank	to	add	that	$10	to	Bob’s	account?	And
then	how	do	the	banks	settle	that	$10	up	between	them?
It	can	be	complex.	Let’s	build	this	up	by	looking	at	the	following
scenarios:
1.
Same	bank
2.
Different	banks
3.
Cross	border	(same	currency)
4.
Foreign	exchange
Same Bank
If	Alice	is	trying	to	pay	$10	to	Bob	and	they	both	have	accounts	at	the
same	bank,	it	is	relatively	straightforward.	Alice	instructs	her	bank	to
make	the	payment,	and	they	bank	then	adjusts	their	records	by
subtracting	$10	from	Alice’s	account	and	adding	$10	Bob’s	account.	In
banking	jargon	some	banks	call	this	a	‘book	transfer’	as	it	is	just	a	transfer
from	one	account	to	another	and	no	money	moves	into,	or	out	of,	the
bank.
If	you	imagine	a	bank	as	managing	a	giant	spreadsheet	with	a	list	of
account	holders	in	the	first	column	and	a	list	of	balances	in	another
column,	the	bank	subtracts	ten	from	Alice’s	row	and	adds	ten	to	Bob’s
row.	I	refer	to	this	book	transfer	as	a	‘-10/+10’	transaction.	Because	this
accounting	entry	has	been	entirely	internal	to	the	bank,	we	can	say	that
the	transaction	‘settles	across	the	bank’s	books’	or	is	‘cleared	by	the	bank’.
A book transfer.
It	is	important	to	understand	that	the	money	in	customer	accounts	is	a
liability
	of	the	banks:	when	you	log	into	your	online	banking	and	see
$100	in	your	account,	this	means	the	bank	
owes
	you	$100	and	should
either	pay	you	that	money	on	demand	(via	a	cashier	or	cash	machine),	or
they	need	to	pay	someone	else	(a	coffee	shop,	a	supermarket,	or	your
friend)	when	you	instruct	and	authorise	them	to	do	so.
So	while	from	
your
	point	of	view	the	money	in	your	account	is	an	asset,
from	the	bank’s	point	of	view,	the	money	in	your	account	is	an
outstanding	liability.	So	the	transaction	on	the	bank’s	balance	sheet
(where	assets	and	liabilities	are	recorded)	looks	more	like	this:
Banks record customer accounts as liabilities.
Although	we	don’t	touch	the	asset	side	of	the	balance	sheet	for	transfers
between	customers	of	the	same	bank,	we	will	need	it	later.
Different Banks
Now	consider	when	Alice	wants	to	pay	$10	to	Bob,	but	they	bank	at
different	banks,	albeit	in	the	same	country	and	currency.	Alice	instructs
her	bank,	Bank	A,	to	remove	$10	from	her	account	and	pay	it	to	Bob’s
account	at	Bank	B.	In	banking	jargon,	Alice	is	the	payer	and	Bob	is	the
beneficiary.
So	Bank	A	reduces	Alice’s	balance,	and	Bank	B	increases	Bob’s	balance.
Alice pays Bob.
The
	
Problem
While	the	customers	are	happy,	can	you	see	the	problem	from	the
perspective	of	the	banks?
Bank	A	now	owes	Alice	$10	less	than	before	and	so	it	is	better	off,	but
Bank	B	now	owes	Bob	$10	more	and	so	is	worse	off.	So	that	can’t	be	the
whole	picture.	Bank	B	would	be	furious!
The
	
Solution
This	payment	instruction	must	be	balanced	by	a	bank	to	bank	transfer:
Bank	A	needs	to	pay	Bank	B	$10	to	balance	out	the	customer	account
movements	and	complete	the	end	to	end	payment.
How	does	an	interbank	payment	happen?	Bank	A	could	put	a	bunch	of
banknotes	in	a	van	and	send	them	to	Bank	B.	This	would	make	both
banks	square:
•
Bank	A	owes	Alice	$10	less	but	pays	$10	in	banknotes	to	Bank	B
•
Bank	B	owes	Bob	$10	more	but	receives	$10	in	banknotes	from	Bank
A
The ‘banknotes in a van’ solution.
But	in	most	countries,	when	banks	want	to	transfer	money	to	each	other,
they	don’t	put	bundles	of	banknotes	in	vans—they	pay	each	other
digitally.
The	Digital
	
Solutions
There	are	two	main	ways	a	bank	can	digitally	pay	another	bank:	by	using
correspondent	bank	accounts;	or	by	using	a	central	bank	payment
system.
Correspondent Bank Accounts
If	you	set	up	a	new	business,	the	first	thing	you	would	want	to	do	is	open
a	bank	account	to	let	you	receive	and	make	payments.
Banks	are	no	different.	If	you	set	up	a	new	bank,	you	still	need	bank
accounts	in	order	to	participate	in	digital	payments.
accounts	in	order	to	participate	in	digital	payments.
Correspondent	bank	accounts	are	industry	jargon	for	the	bank	accounts
that	banks	open	with	other	banks.	These	are	also	called	‘nostros’	(
nostro
is	a	Latin	word	meaning	‘our,’	as	in	‘our	account’).	Correspondent
bank
ing
	describes	activities	related	to	the	use	of	these	accounts.
In	your	new	bank’s	balance	sheet,	the	deposits	you	hold	in	your	nostros
would	appear	as	assets,	in	the	same	way	as,	you	(as	an	individual)
consider	the	deposits	you	hold	in	your	bank	to	be	your	assets.	The	bank
that	you	opened	the	account	with,	your	correspondent	bank,	shows	those
funds	as	their	liability,	in	the	same	way	as	your	own	consumer	bank
regards	your	individual	deposits	as	its	liability.
Correspondent banking is just banks holding accounts with each other.
If	you	google	for	your	bank’s	name	and	‘correspondent	banks,’	you	might
find	a	list	of	accounts	where	they	hold	their	foreign	currency.	Here	is	an
example	from	the	Commonwealth	Bank	of	Australia	(CBA)
55
:
You	can	see	that	CBA	has	opened	a	US	dollar	account	at	the	Bank	of	New
York	Mellon	and	a	Euro	account	at	Societe	Generale.	The	SWIFT	codes
are	identifiers	for	those	specific	banks.
So,	back	to	our	example.	If	Bank	A	had	an	account	at	Bank	B,	it	could
instruct	Bank	B	to	transfer	the	$10	from	its	account	to	Bob’s	account:
Bank A pays from its nostro.
In	this	way,	the	banks	are	neatly	squared	off:
•
Bank	A	owes	Alice	$10	less	but	has	$10	less	in	its	account	with	Bank
B
•
Bank	B	owes	Bob	$10	more	but	owes	Bank	A	$10	less
The	Problem	with	Correspondent	Bank
	
Accounts
Although	correspondent	bank	accounts	allow	payments	to	flow,	they	can
also	present	difficulties	for	the	banks	themselves.	Imagine	running	a
bank	and	having	to	maintain	accounts	at	every	single	other	bank	that
your	customers	might	want	to	transfer	money	to.	You’d	need	to	open
accounts	at	every	single	bank	in	the	world,	just	in	case	you	have	a
customer	who	wants	to	transfer	to	someone	who	banks	there.	This	would
be	an	operational	nightmare.
The	correspondent	banking	problem.
And	it	would	be	expensive,	as	you’d	need	to	have	a	positive	balance	at
each	of	these	banks	in	anticipation	of	payment	instructions,	and	as	we	all
know,	money	sitting	in	current	accounts	doesn’t	earn	much	interest.
You’d	prefer	to	put	that	capital	to	work	elsewhere.	And	it	is	risky,	too!
What	if	any	of	your	correspondent	banks	went	bankrupt?	You’d	lose	your
money.
Central	bank	accounts	provide	a	more	efficient	way.
Central Bank Accounts
One	of	the	roles	of	a	central	bank	is	to	enable	banks	in	its	jurisdiction	to
pay	each	other	electronically	without	each	of	them	having	to	maintain
accounts	with	one	another.	The	idea	is	that	the	central	bank	acts	as	a
bank	for	the	banks	in	its	currency	zone.	This	allows	payments	to	be	made
between	any	of	the	banks	in	the	jurisdiction,	each	needs	to	only	maintain
one	account	at	the	central	bank	instead	of	accounts	with	all	the	others	in
the	jurisdiction.	Money	held	at	the	central	bank	is	called	
reserves.
Each	bank	holds	an	account	with	the	central	bank.
Banks	can	have	multiple	accounts	with	central	banks	each	for	different
purposes,	in	the	same	way	that	you	can	have	multiple	savings	pots—a
deposit	for	the	home	you	hope	to	buy,	a	holiday,	a	new	car,	a	wedding,
provision	for	a	rainy	day,	
etc.
	Here,	we	care	about	the	accounts	that	are
used	for	interbank	payments.
We	call	the	systems	that	manage	these	records	
interbank	settlement
systems
.	There	are	broadly	two	types:
•
Deferred	Net	Settlement	(DNS)	systems
•
Real	Time	Gross	Settlement	(RTGS)	systems
DNS	Systems
DNS	systems	are	systems	that	queue	up	payments	due	between	banks
then	make	a	single	payment	at	the	end	of	a	given	period	of	time,	for
example	at	the	end	of	every	day.	Payments	in	both	directions	are	‘netted
off,’	and	one	single	payment	of	the	outstanding	balance,	in	whichever
direction	it	is	due,	is	made	at	the	end	of	the	period.	For	example,
throughout	the	day	Bank	A	will	accumulate	payments	to	make	to	Bank	B,
and	Bank	B	will	accumulate	payments	to	Bank	A.	At	the	end	of	each	day,
these	payments	will	be	added	up	against	each	other	and	only	one	single
payment	will	be	made	representing	the	net	total	owed,	either	by	Bank	A
to	Bank	B	or	by	Bank	B	to	Bank	A,	depending	on	the	day’s	transactions.
DNS	systems	are	capital	efficient.	Banks	need	to	set	aside	only	the
forecast	
net
	amount	of	outflow	in	a	given	period,	taking	into	account	the
expected	inflow.	You	do	the	same	when	you	set	aside	money	for	next
month’s	expenses	but	‘net	off’	your	expected	income	(e.g.,	your	salary)	in
that	period.
But	there	is	a	
credit	risk
	that	builds	up	during	each	period,	which
describes	the	risk	that	the	forecast	inflow	doesn’t	come	in	or,	in	the	worst
case,	a	bank	becomes	bankrupt	mid-period.	This	risk	can	have	a	systemic
impact,	as	one	failed	obligation	can	impact	the	recipient’s	ability	to	make
their	payments.	There	needs	to	be	a	mechanism	to	ensure	least
disruption	to	the	remaining	participants.
RTGS	Systems
With	RTGS	systems	the	-10/+10	adjustments	on	the	central	bank’s	books
are	made	in	‘real	time’	during	the	day	as	soon	as	a	payment	instruction	is
made	by	a	customer.	Each	payment	instruction	is	settled	independently
and	not	grouped,	batched,	or	netted	off	against	any	other	instructions.
This	is	known	as	‘gross	settlement,’	the	opposite	of	‘net	settlement’.
DNS	systems	used	to	be	popular,	but	nowadays	most	central	banks	also
operate	some	kind	of	RTGS	system	to	settle	immediate	payment
instructions,	and	customers	increasingly	expect	payments	to	be	made	in
real	time.	These	RTGS	systems	operate	at	least	during	office	hours,	and
many	systems	now	operate	24x7,	at	least	for	small	transactions.	The
trade-off	is	that	banks	need	to	set	aside	more	capital	to	make	sure	all
payments	can	be	made	immediately.
So,	back	to	the	example.	How	does	Alice	pay	Bob	if	both	of	their	banks
are	on	a	RTGS	system?
As	both	Bank	A	and	Bank	B	are	on	the	central	bank’s	RTGS	system,	the
central	bank	performs	the	-$10/+$10	to	remove	money	from	Bank	A’s
account	and	add	it	to	Bank	B’s	account.	This	is	the	settlement	between
the	two	banks,	and	in	industry	terminology,	it	is	said	that	the	central
bank	‘clears’	the	transaction.	The	account	which	each	bank	holds	with	the
central	bank	for	this	purpose	is	sometimes	called	their	clearing	account.
Interbank payment via RTGS.
So	to	recap,	and	remember,	here	we	are	dealing	with	a	single	currency
only:
•
If	both	customers	bank	with	the	same	bank,	then	that	bank	itself
clears	the	transaction.
•
If	two	banks	have	a	‘correspondent	banking’	relationship,	then	the
receiving	bank	clears	the	transaction.
•
If	there	is	a	central	bank	system—a	RTGS	or	DNS—then	the	central
bank	clears	the	transaction.
Clearing
Unfortunately,	the	word	
clearing
	is	used	to	mean	different	things	in
different	contexts.	As	we	have	just	seen,	clearing	in	
payments
	refers	to
the	final	-$10/+$10	transaction.	It	is	not	to	be	confused	with	clearing	in
securities	trading
,	which	means	something	else.
In	securities	trading	(for	example,	shares),	two	parties	strike	a	deal,	say
on	a	stock	exchange:	one	buys	from	or	sells	to	the	other	in	return	for
electronic	cash.	But	they	do	not	exchange	the	cash	and	shares	directly
with	each	other:	they	settle	against	a	central	clearing	party	instead.	So
once	a	trade	between	parties	A	and	B	is	agreed,	A	and	B	actually	both
settle	up	with	C,	the	central	clearing	party.
C,	the	central	clearing	counterparty	(CCP),	acts	as	the	legal	trading
counterparty	to	each	side.	So	where,	for	example,	A	buys	shares	from	B,	A
sends	the	cash	or	funds	to	C
56
,	and	B	sends	the	shares	to	C
57
.	Once	C	has
received	the	right	amount	of	funds	and	shares	from	the	respective	sides,
it	then	reassigns	the	funds	and	the	shares	respectively,	i.e.,	it	gives	the
shares	to	A	and	the	funds	to	B.	This	setup	removes	the	credit	risk
between	A	and	B:	A	and	B	no	longer	have	credit	risk	with	each	other;
instead,	they	both	have	credit	risk	with	C,	whom	they	both	trust	for	this
purpose,	at	least	more	than	they	trust	each	other.
Clearing
	
Banks
Back	to	payments,	in	some	countries	only	certain	banks	get	to	have
accounts	with	the	central	bank.	These	are	called	‘clearing	banks,’	because
they	can	clear	payments,	as	we	have	seen	above,	through	the	central
bank.	Smaller	banks,	or	foreign	banks	with	a	local	presence	who	are	not
able	to	access	the	central	bank,	need	to	open	accounts	with	a	clearing
bank	instead.	The	clearing	banks	get	to	make	fees	from	their	privileged
position.
Thus,	you	get	a	pyramid,	a	hierarchy	of	relationships,	with	the	central
bank	sitting	at	the	top,	the	clearing	banks	sitting	a	layer	below,	and	finally
smaller	banks,	or	non-clearers,	who	don’t	have	an	account	at	the	central
bank.	They	use	a	clearing	bank	to	make	payments	in	the	same	way	a
clearing	bank	uses	a	central	bank,	knowing	that	the	clearing	bank	can	call
upon	the	central	bank	to	clear	its	own	payments	when	it	needs	to.
Hierarchy of banks.
Different	jurisdictions	operate	differently.	The	UK’s	RTGS	system,	for
example,	known	as	CHAPS,	is	highly	tiered.	Only	a	small	number	of
banks
58
	have	accounts	at	the	UK’s	central	bank,	the	Bank	of	England;
whereas	in	Hong	Kong	all	licensed	banks	operating	in	the	jurisdiction	are
required	to	have	an	account	at	its	central	bank,	the	Hong	Kong	Monetary
Authority
59
.
Although	a	central	set	of	books	run	by	a	central	bank	is	much	more
efficient	than	each	bank	maintaining	lots	of	accounts	(or	‘nostros’)	with
every	other	bank,	the	system	works	only	within	one	jurisdiction	and	in
one	currency.	So	while	most	economically	developed	jurisdictions	will
have	a	centrally	cleared	RTGS	or	DNS	system	for	clearing	interbank
payments	within	that	country	for	their	respective	domestic	currency,
there	is	no	‘central	bank’	of	the	world
60
,	not	even	the	World	Bank,
however	grand	and	ambitious	its	name.
International Payments
What	do	we	mean	by	international	payments?	Well,	there	are	two	main
types.
Firstly,	there	is	the	payment	of	a	
single	currency
	across	a	border.	The
receiver	receives	units	of	the	same	currency	that	the	sender	sends.	For
example,	someone	sends	USD	across	a	border	and	someone	else	receives
USD.	This	means	the	USD	is	either	
leaving
	its	domestic	currency	zone	(in
this	case	the	USA),	or	it	is	
returning
	to	its	domestic	currency	zone,	or	it	is
moving	between
	two	countries	outside	its	domestic	currency	zone	(e.g.,
between	the	UK	and	Singapore).
Secondly,	there	is	the	transfer	of	value	across	borders,	
with	foreign
exchange
,	where	the	sender	and	receiver	are	working	in	different
currencies.	For	example,	the	sender	has	GBP	removed	from	her	GBP
account	in	the	UK	and	the	receiver	has	SGD	added	to	her	SGD	account	in
Singapore.
By	exploring	these	concepts	separately	we	will	see	that	money,	in	general,
does	not	leave	its	domestic	currency	zone.
As	we	have	seen,	there	is	no	central	bank	of	the	world	to	clear
international	commercial	payments,	so	we	have	to	fall	back	to	the	less
efficient	correspondent	banking	systems	where	banks	maintain	accounts
with	each	other.
Single	Currency	Transfers	Across	a	Border
Have	you	ever	thought	about	how	your	bank	can	offer	you	a	current
Have	you	ever	thought	about	how	your	bank	can	offer	you	a	current
account	in	a	currency	from	a	jurisdiction	where	your	bank	doesn’t	have	a
banking	licence?	How	does	it	do	that?	How	does	it	receive	and	make
payments?
The	answer,	as	you	might	have	guessed	by	now,	is	that	the	bank	has	an
account	with	a	correspondent	bank	licensed	in	the	country	of	the
currency.	For	example,	a	Singapore	bank	may	not	have	a	banking	licence
in	the	UK.	If	it	wishes	to	offer	to	hold	GBP	for	its	customers,	it	will
maintain	a	GBP	denominated	account	(a	nostro)	with	a	major	bank	in	the
UK,	preferably	a	clearing	bank,	and	it	will	then	use	that	as	a	mega-
account	(called	an	‘omnibus’	account)	for	all	its	customers’	GBP	currency.
Foreign currency accounts.
So,	a	Singapore	bank	customer,	Alice	(a	new	Alice),	might	log	in	to	her
Singapore	bank	website	and	see	that	she	has	£200	in	her	GBP	account,
but	the	£200	is	actually	sitting	in	a	UK	bank	under	the	name	of	the
Singapore	bank,	alongside	any	other	GBP	which	the	Singapore	bank	is
holding	for	its	other	customers.	Alice	thinks	she	has	£200	in	her
Singapore	bank,	but	really	the	money	is	sitting	in	a	UK	bank,	and	her
Singapore	bank	just	shows	her	her	share	of	a	larger	account	they	are
holding	on	behalf	of	all	their	GBP	customers.
Sending	GBP	from	UK	to
	
Singapore
So	let’s	see	what	happens	when	Bob	(a	new	Bob),	Alice’s	British	friend
So	let’s	see	what	happens	when	Bob	(a	new	Bob),	Alice’s	British	friend
wants	to	send	£10	to	Alice’s	sterling	account	in	her	Singapore	bank.	Let’s
assume	Bob	banks	in	the	UK	with	a	different	bank	from	the	bank	that
Alice’s	Singapore	bank	uses	as	its	correspondent	bank.

Bob sends £10 from his GBP account at his UK bank to Alice’s GBP account at her
SG bank.
When	Alice	in	Singapore	receives	GBP	from	Bob,	the	money	is	actually
moving	across	the	Bank	of	England’s	RTGS	system	and	arriving	in	the
Singapore	bank’s	nostro	at	its	correspondent	bank	in	the	UK.	The	GBP	is
not	moving	in	or	out	of	the	country…	it	is	simply	changing	ownership
within	the	UK.
Where	banks	(often	larger	ones)	have	subsidiaries	with	banking	licences
in	other	jurisdictions,	they	will	preferentially	use	their	subsidiaries	for
their	nostros.	For	example,	a	US	bank,	Citibank	N.A.,	has	a	subsidiary
bank	in	the	UK	called	106	THE	BASICS	OF	BITCOINS	AND
BLOCKCHAINS	‘Citibank	N.A.	London	Branch’	
61
	which	is	a	clearing	bank
in	the	UK.	So	Citibank	N.A.	would	use	Citibank	N.A.	London	Branch	as
its	GBP	nostro.	So	if	Alice	and	Bob	opened	GBP	accounts	with	Citibank
N.A.,	the	funds	would	really	be	held	by	Citibank	N.A.	London	Branch:
That	is	what	happens	if	one	of	the	banks	is	in	the	country	of	the	currency
being	moved.
Sending	USD	from	UK	to
	
Singapore
We	have	seen	what	happens	if	one	of	the	banks	is	operating	in	the
domestic	zone	of	the	currency	being	moved.	But	what	if	both	banks	are
outside	that	zone?	For	example,	what	if	Bob,	in	the	UK,	wants	to	pay
Alice,	in	Singapore,	USD	$10?
Bob	and	Alice	both	have	USD	‘foreign	currency’	accounts	at	their
Bob	and	Alice	both	have	USD	‘foreign	currency’	accounts	at	their
respective	banks	in	their	respective	countries.	Neither	bank	may	have
banking	licences	in	the	USA,	so	they	must	have	correspondent	bank
accounts—their	respective	nostros—with	a	US	correspondent	bank.	In	the
simplest	case,	if	they	both	use	the	same	correspondent,	then	the	USD	is
cleared	by	that	correspondent,	who	does	a	-$10/+$10	book	entry	between
the	banks’	nostros.
If	the	banks	have	USD	nostros	at	
different
	correspondent	banks,	then	the
USD	is	cleared	by	the	central	bank,	the	Federal	Reserve,	who,	as	we	have
seen	above,	records	the	-$10/+$10	movement	between	the	accounts	of
the	correspondent	banks.
Note	that	the	USD	moves	in	the	USA,	not	in	the	UK	or	in	Singapore.
Currencies	(in	electronic	form)	stay	inside	their	domestic	zone
62
!
And	that	is	the	happy	scenario	where	Alice’s	and	Bob’s	banks	are	lucky
enough	to	have	nostros	at	USD	clearing	banks	(who	in	turn	have	accounts
with	the	central	bank).	Sometimes	smaller	banks	or	banks	licensed	in	less
well-regulated	environments	might	not	be	able	to	establish	banking
relationships	in	major	banking	jurisdictions	abroad:	the	big	clearing
banks	see	the	small	banks	as	not	worth	the	effort,	risk,	and	paperwork
required	to	establish	and	maintain	a	high-confidence	working
relationship.	The	banks	perceived	as	more	risky	need	to	open	accounts
with	local	banks	perceived	as	less	risky,	who	could	have	correspondent
accounts	at	small	US	banks	who	might	in	turn	have	correspondent
accounts	at	major	US	clearing	banks…
So	payments	take	longer,	there	is	more	operational	risk,	there	is	less
transparency,	and	fees	accumulate.	The	effect	of	this,	in	practice,	is	a
form	of	financial	exclusion.	Some	small	banks	and	financial	institutions
in	less	stable	regions	are	practically	excluded	from	the	major	financial
system,	and	this	is	detrimental	to	their	growth	and	the	growth	of	their
system,	and	this	is	detrimental	to	their	growth	and	the	growth	of	their
customers’	businesses	and	other	economic	activity	within	their	local
economies.
This	form	of	financial	exclusion	is	increasing.	For	example,	the	World
Bank	conducted	a	survey	in	2015
63
	of	110	banking	authorities,	twenty
large	banks	and	170	smaller	local	and	regional	banks.	It	found	that
roughly	half	of	those	surveyed	experienced	a	decline	in	correspondent
banking	relationships,	directly	reducing	their	ability	to	conduct	foreign
currency	transactions.	Money	Transfer	Operators	(MTOs,	non-banks)
were	also	surveyed	and	it	was	found	that	of	the	MTOs	surveyed,	28%	of
MTO	principals	and	45%	of	their	agents	could	no	longer	access	banking
services.	Of	those,	25%	were	no	longer	able	to	operate	and	75%	had	to
find	alternative	channels	for	foreign	currency	transactions.
Large	banks	have	been	actively	closing	down	the	nostros	of	foreign	banks,
especially	banks	from	those	jurisdictions	which	are	deemed	higher	risk.
The	large	banks	cite	the	risk	of	being	fined	or	suffering	reputational	risk	if
the	banks	for	whom	they	open	nostros	are	found	to	be	using	those
nostros	for,	or	are	otherwise	associated	with,	illegal	or	unethical
activities.
This	has	affected	the	cryptocurrency	industry	too.	In	2015,	there	were
rumours	that	the	big	US	banks	would	threaten	to	cut	off	smaller	banks	if
the	smaller	banks	continued	to	bank	Bitcoin	exchanges.	This	‘de-risking,’
as	it	is	euphemistically	known,	is	serving	to	cut	off	the	parties	who	need
their	services	the	most,	and	is	creating	a	moat	around	the	larger
economies,	disabling	smaller	economies	from	flourishing.	My	favourite
financial	columnist,	Matt	Levine,	made	some	comments	about	big	banks
threatening	to	cut	off	smaller	banks	who	bank	cryptocurrency	exchanges
in	his	Bloomberg	column	“Money	Stuff”

The concern here is that JPMorgan might transfer money for another bank, and that other
bank might transfer money for a Bitcoin exchange, and that Bitcoin exchange might transfer
money for a drug dealer. Which, in the eyes of the law, means that JPMorgan might as well be
dealing drugs itself.
I sometimes think about the analogy between banks and airlines: If a drug dealer uses a bank
to move money, that bank is held responsible, but if he just gets on a plane with a bag of
money, no one thinks to hold the airline responsible.
But this is much further removed. This is like, a taxi driver flies on United Airlines from New
York to Miami, and in Miami he picks up a guy who owns a boat and drives him to the
marina, and then the guy with boat transports bags of cash for a drug dealer, and you hold
United responsible.
Vast swathes of legitimate financial transactions will be cut off if you punish banks for
dealing with people who deal with people who deal with people who commit crimes.
Euro-currencies
Reality	is	always	more	complicated	than	theory,	especially	in	banking.
Currencies	
can
	actually	be	created	and	exist	outside	of	their	domestic
zones	or	home	jurisdictions.	Examples	are	‘Euro-currencies,’	e.g.,	Euro-
dollar,	Euro-euro,	Euro-sterling.	The	Euro-prefix	originated	from	Europe
the	region,	and	should	not	be	confused	with:
•
the	Euro	currency	(€)	itself,	or
•
the	terminology	used	in	the	foreign	exchange	(FX)	trading,	e.g.,
‘Euro/dollar’	which	refers	to	the	exchange	rate	between	euros	and
dollars.
In	this	context,	the	prefix	‘Euro’	indicates	that	the	currency	exists	outside
of	its	home	zone.	It	was	first	used	when	the	first	USD	loan	was	created
outside	of	the	USA,	in	Europe.	So,	Euro-dollar,	Euro-sterling,	and	Euro-
euro	mean,	respectively,	a	US	dollar	that	exists	outside	the	USA,	a	British
pound	that	exists	outside	the	UK,	and	a	Euro	that	exists	outside	the
Eurozone.
How	are	Euro-currencies	created?	When	a	bank	writes	a	loan	in	the
currency	outside	its	domestic	currency	zone	(e.g.,	a	British	bank	issuing	a
loan	in	USD),	it	creates	money	that	exists	outside	its	currency	zone	(i.e.,
USD	deposits	existing	outside	the	USA).	This	is	allowed	and	is	normal
business	practice,	fairly	common	in	fact,	but	complicates	the	financial
world,	especially	when	countries	are	trying	to	count	how	much	of	their
own	currency	exists	in	the	world.	So	it	is	not	the	case	that	all	currency	is
directly	controlled	by	its	respective	central	bank.
At	this	stage,	it	is	worth	busting	a	common	myth.	It	is	commonly	believed
that	banks	take	money	from	one	customer	and	lend	it	to	another.	This	is	a
sloppy	way	of	thinking	about	banking	and	leads	to	incorrect	conclusions.
Banks	
create
	money,	in	the	form	of	deposits,	when	they	write	loans.
These	new	deposits	are	new	money,	sometimes	called	‘fountain	pen
money’	because	bankers	used	to	approve	loans	by	signing	a	document
with	a	fountain	pen.	If	you	take	out	an	unsecured	loan	from	a	bank,	the
bank	adds	deposits	to	your	account	(increasing	their	total	liabilities)	and
adds	a	loan	to	their	balance	sheet	(increasing	their	total	assets).	New
money	has	been	created;	it	hasn’t	been	‘borrowed’	from	another
depositor.	The	Bank	of	England	explains	this	in	a	research	piece	entitled
‘Money	creation	in	the	modern	economy’
65
.
Foreign	Exchange
Now	that	we’ve	dealt	with	single	currency	payments	(that	is,	the
movement	across	borders	of	value	denominated	in	a	single	currency),
what	about	foreign	exchange?	What	about	Alice	wanting	to	send	GBP
from	her	sterling	account	for	it	to	arrive	as	USD	in	Bob’s	US	dollar
account?
Money	doesn’t	simply	‘become’	other	money,	just	because	of	‘banks’.
Pounds	sterling	cannot	become	US	dollars	any	more	than	a	pint	of	milk
can	become	a	litre	of	beer,	or	a	lump	of	silver	can	become	a	lump	of	gold.
1	pound	is	not	1.2	dollars.	1	pound	is	not	even	‘the	same	as’	1.2	dollars.
Sterling	is	a	completely	different	asset	from	US	dollars,	and	assets	and
currencies	
cannot
,	and	
do	not
,	magically	morph	from	one	type	to
another.	You	always	need	a	third	party	who	is	prepared	to	accept	one
currency	and	give	you	the	other.

In	a	payment	involving	two	currencies,	someone	somewhere	is	acting	as	a
third	party	willing	to	accept	some	of	your	currency	in	return	for	some	of
the	other	currency.	When	Alice	pays	GBP	to	end	up	as	USD	in	Bob’s
account,	the	role	of	exchanger	may	be	fulfilled	by	Alice’s	bank,	who	will
deduct	GBP	from	Alice’s	account,	and	credit	USD	to	Bob’s	bank,	or	by
Bob’s	bank,	who	will	accept	GBP	from	Alice’s	bank,	and	credit	USD	into
Bob’s	account.	Or	Alice	could	use	a	specific	third	party,	an	MTO	such	as
Transferwise.	Transferwise,	and	other	similar	MTOs,	have	local	currency
accounts	in	banks	in	many	countries,	and	they	will	receive	GBP	from
Alice	into	their	GBP	account	in	London,	and	they	will	instruct	their	USD
bank	in	New	York	to	send	some	USD	from	their	USD	account	to	Bob’s
account.	Transferwise	has	therefore	changed	the	balance	of	currencies	it
holds	by	holding	more	GBP	and	less	USD.	This	in	turn	changes	its	risk
arising	from	foreign	exchange	fluctuations—that	is,	movements	in	the
value	of	those	currencies	relative	to	each	other.	To	maintain	its	original
risk	profile,	Transferwise	will	then	hope	that	someone	will	want	to	send
money	the	other	way,	helping	to	square	up	its	books,	or	it	may	try	to	sell
those	extra	GBP	to	another	agent	for	USD.

Cross border transactions with foreign exchange.
E-Money Wallets
In	recent	years,	digital	wallets	have	become	more	popular,	and	the
industry	landscape	continues	to	evolve	quickly.	Digital	wallets	are	usually
smartphone	apps	that	allow	customers	to	open	accounts.	Customers	fund
their	wallets	using	a	credit	or	debit	card,	a	bank	payment,	or	by	paying
physical	cash	to	an	agent,	usually	in	a	convenience	store.	Once	money	has
physical	cash	to	an	agent,	usually	in	a	convenience	store.	Once	money	has
been	transferred	from	the	customer	to	the	wallet	operator,	the	customer
sees	a	balance	in	their	wallet,	which	can	then	be	used.	Depending	on	the
services	provided	by	the	wallet,	it	can	be	used	to	temporarily	store	value
or	to	send	money	to	other	customers,	pay	bills,	buy	tickets,	shop	at
various	merchants,	pay	for	taxis,	pay	for	groceries	at	the	checkout,	and
even	pay	speeding	tickets.	Many	providers	offer	a	‘virtual’	credit	or	debit
card	number	that	is	connected	to	the	customer’s	digital	wallet.	This
allows	customers	who	may	not	have	otherwise	be	able	to	get	a	credit	or
debit	card	to	make	payments	anywhere	that	those	cards	are	accepted,	and
sometimes	even	make	ATM	cash	withdrawals.
PayPal,	Venmo	(owned	by	PayPal),	and	Starbucks	are	popular	digital
wallets	in	the	USA.	In	India,	Paytm	and	Oxigen	are	the	leading	providers.
GoPay,	owned	by	Indonesian	ridesharing	app	GoJek,	is	popular	in
Indonesia	and	is	gaining	traction	in	the	rest	of	Southeast	Asia,	where	the
dominant	ridesharing	app	Grab	also	has	a	wallet.	In	China,	Alipay	and
WeChat	Pay	are	used	extensively	to	store	value	and	make	payments.	The
rate	of	customer	growth	of	these	wallets	is	astonishing:	Alipay	alone	has
over	500	million	registered	users	and	100	million	daily	active	users.
Early	wallets	were	provided	by	telecommunications	companies	(telcos),
who	were	already	dealing	in	pre-paid	airtime,	a	different	type	of	digital
currency.	It	was	a	small	step	to	allow	customers	to	move	money	into	a
wallet	denominated	in	fiat	currency	rather	than	in	‘minutes,’	especially	as
the	wallet	would	exist	on	a	device	that	the	customer	had	likely	bought
from	the	telco	(do	you	remember	when	handsets	were	branded	with	the
telco’s	logo?).	However,	telcos	were	unable	to	maintain	their	early	lead
due	to	their	‘walled-garden’	approach,	so	this	first	wave	of	digital	wallets
was	not,	on	the	whole,	successful.
Today’s	wallets	have	either	developed	from	private	companies	who	could
Today’s	wallets	have	either	developed	from	private	companies	who	could
navigate	the	airtime-to-wallet	path	well	(PayTM),	or	ridesharing
companies	who,	due	to	their	popularity,	have	gigantic	scale	(Grab,
GoJek),	or	companies	that	started	as	social	messaging	apps	and	added
payments	(WeChat).
These	businesses	operate	under	different	licences	in	different
jurisdictions.	The	names	of	the	regulatory	licences	used	by	these	wallet
businesses	differ	by	jurisdiction.	Examples	include:	e-Money;	Money
Transmitter;	Stored	Value	Card;	Remittance;	Wallet;	Money	Transfer,
and	so	on.	These	licences	tend	to	be	easier	to	obtain	than	banking
licences,	but	the	permitted	activities	are	more	limited.	In	most
jurisdictions,	licensees	are	usually	forbidden	to	write	loans	or	create
money,	a	privilege	granted	to	lenders	and	banks.	Every	dollar	or	unit	of
currency	that	a	customer	sees	in	their	app	must	be	backed	by	an
equivalent	dollar	in	the	company’s	bank	account.
E-Money	wallets	are	easy	to	understand	from	a	payments	perspective.
Each	operator	has	a	bank	account	that	is	ring-fenced	to	contain	only
customer	money.	This	account	must	not	be	used	for	company	operations
such	as	receiving	income	or	paying	salaries.	When	customers	fund	their
wallets,	transfers	are	made	into	this	bank	account.	When	customers	of
one	operator	move	money	between	each	other,	there	is	no	change	to	the
money	in	the	bank	account,	but	the	wallet	operator	records	a	debit	to	one
customer	and	a	credit	to	another—a	-$10/+$10	in	its	books.	If	a	customer
withdraws	money	from	their	account,	then	the	wallet	operator	makes	a
corresponding	bank	transfer	to	the	customer’s	bank	account.	Customers
are	not	limited	to	individuals.	Merchants,	minicab	drivers,	utilities
companies,	and	public-sector	entities	are	often	customers	of	wallets,	and
wallets	are	becoming	a	convenient	and	common	way	to	pay	bills	in	some
countries.
The	rise	of	wallets,	due	in	part	to	their	focus	on	delivering	a	superior	user
The	rise	of	wallets,	due	in	part	to	their	focus	on	delivering	a	superior	user
experience,	has	caused	some	concern	from	banks.	In	some	jurisdictions
banks	are	losing	relevance	with	their	customers	and	losing	data	and
revenue	from	payments.	Wallets	are	increasingly	sitting	between	the
customers	and	their	respective	banks.
In	Europe,	one	of	the	most	successful	‘challenger	banks,’	Revolut,	uses	an
e-money	wallet	licence,	so	is	not	technically	a	bank.	Despite	this,	it	offers
a	full	suite	of	payments,	savings,	insurance,	pensions,	loans	and
investments.	Revolut	is	the	customer-facing	front-end	through	which
licensed	providers	offer	their	services.	This	dynamic	raises	interesting
questions	as	to	the	future	of	licensed	banks.
Banks	need	to	make	a	tough	decision:	They	should	either	try	to	re-engage
with	their	customers	and	become	more	relevant	by	providing	better	user
experiences,	or	they	should	focus	on	becoming	extremely	efficient
financial	pipes	in	the	background.	Both	models	are	viable	if	executed
well.


Part 3
CRYPTOGRAPHY
CRYPTOGRAPHY
It	is	time	to	take	a	deep	breath.	To	really	understand	Bitcoin	and
cryptocurrencies	at	more	than	just	a	superficial	cocktail	party	level	you
will	have	to	understand	a	few	concepts	from	a	branch	of	mathematics
called	cryptography.	The	section	on	cryptocurrencies	will	assume	you	are
familiar	with	the	concepts	discussed	here.
Don’t	skip	this	chapter—it’ll	be	fun.	Cryptography	is,	among	other	things,
about	sending	secret	messages	that	can	be	read	only	by	the	intended
recipient.	It	is	the	stuff	that	spies	use.	We	will	cover	encryption	and
decryption	(the	encoding	and	decoding	of	messages),	hashing	(turning
data	into	fingerprint	
digests
),	and	digital	signatures	(proofs	that	you	have
created	or	approved	a	message).
Cryptography	is,	however,	not	
just
	for	spies,	criminals,	and	terrorists.	It	is
now	used	extensively	to	protect	data	that	travels	across	the	internet.	The
‘s’	in	‘https’	stands	for	
secure
.	It	means	that	cryptography	is	being	used	to
guarantee	that	the	website	you	think	you	are	visiting	is	in	fact	the	genuine
website.	It	also	means	that	the	data	in	flight	between	you	and	that
website	is	encrypted	or	jumbled	up,	so	snoopers	can’t	easily	read	the
communications	between	your	device	and	the	website	that	you	are
accessing.
ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION
Although	cryptography	is	used	for	many	more	purposes	than	simply
encrypting	and	decrypting	secret	messages,	encryption	is	the	most	well-
known	use	of	cryptography,	so	let’s	start	with	this.	Blockchains	are	not
generally	encrypted,	but	understanding	encryption	provides	a	good
background	to	cryptography	which	
is
	used	extensively	in	blockchains.
Encryption
	is	the	process	of	turning	a	
plaintext
	(i.e.,	readable)	human
message	into	
cyphertext
	(a	jumble,	gobbledegook),	so	that	if	the
encrypted	message	is	intercepted	a	snooper	can’t	understand	it.
Decryption
	is	the	process	of	turning	the	gobbledegook	cyphertext	back
into	readable	plaintext.	‘Breaking’	the	cyphertext	means	working	out	how
to	decrypt	cyphertext	without	being	given	the	‘key’	(see	below).
Let’s	say	Alice	wants	to	send	a	message	to	Bob,	so	that	only	Bob	can	read
it	(it	is	always	Alice	and	Bob,	and	we	will	see	why	later).	Alice	and	Bob
first	agree	on	a	scheme.	Let’s	use	a	very	simple	scheme	where	they
encrypt	the	text	by	shifting	each	letter	a	set	number	of	places	later	in	the
alphabet.	They	agree	to	use	‘+1’	as	the	‘key,’	meaning	that	each	letter	is
moved	one	place	later	in	the	alphabet.	So	A	becomes	B,	B	becomes	C,	C
becomes	D	
etc.
	This	scheme	is	called	the	
Caesar
	
cipher
.
Alice	writes	the	plaintext	note	‘Let’s	meet,	Bob’.
Alice	encrypts	it	by	shifting	each	letter	once	to	the	right:	‘Mfu’t	nffu,	Cpc’.
Alice	sends	the	cyphertext	to	Bob.
Bob	decrypts	the	cyphertext	by	shifting	each	letter	back	by	one	position
and	gets	back	the	plaintext:	‘Let’s	meet,	Bob’.
This	type	of	encryption	is	part	of	a	family	called	‘symmetric	encryption,’
because	the	same	key	(+1	in	this	case)	is	used	in	both	the	encryption	and
decryption	stages.
This	method	of	encryption	is	not	used	in	real	life	nowadays.	Firstly,
because	it	is	too	easy	to	spot	and	break	using	techniques	such	as	letter
frequency	analysis.	Secondly,	and	more	importantly,	Alice	and	Bob	first
had	to	communicate	to	agree	what	key	to	use	for	the	scheme.	They	had	to
agree	on	the	‘+1’	in	the	first	place.	How	do	they	know	that	someone
wasn’t	snooping	when	they	agreed	that?
wasn’t	snooping	when	they	agreed	that?
Perhaps	Alice	and	Bob	met	physically	earlier	and	agreed	on	the	‘+1’	in
person,	but	if	they	suspect	at	any	stage	that	a	snooper	has	compromised
them,	either	in	that	meeting	or	during	the	course	of	their	conversations,
how	would	they	then	agree	on	a	new	key	without	the	snooper	being	aware
of	
that
	new	communication?
In	a	world	where	our	devices	are	constantly	initiating	connections	with
new	websites,	any	initial	‘handshake’	where	a	symmetric	key	is	agreed
and	shared	between	your	device	and	the	website	is	a	weak	point,	and	any
eavesdropper	who	snoops	on	that	initial	exchange	can	decrypt	the	secret
messages	for	the	rest	of	the	conversation.	So	later	we	will	explore
asymmetric
	cryptography,	a	much	more	commonly	used	form	of
encryption.
How	is	encryption	relevant	to	blockchains?	Actually,	it	is	not	very
relevant.	Many	journalists	and	management	consultants	talk	about
encrypted	blockchains,	but	they	are	confusing	
encrypted	data
,	not	used
in	first	generation	blockchains
66
,	with	
cryptography
	which	is	used
extensively	in	blockchains	for	hashing	and	digital	signatures,	as	we	will
see	later.	Nothing	on	the	Bitcoin	network	is	encrypted	by	default.	The
whole	point
	is	that	plain	text	transaction	data	is	replicated	across	the
network	so	that	anyone	can	read	and	validate	it.
However,	other	cryptographic	schemes	such	as	public	key	schemes,
discussed	next,	are	used	extensively	in	Bitcoin,	as	are	cryptographic
hashes.
Public	Key	Cryptography
The	Caesar	cypher	just	described	is	known	as	a	
symmetric
	cypher
because	the	same	key	is	used	to	encrypt	and	decrypt	the	message.	In
public	key	cryptography,	the	key	used	to	decrypt	a	message	is	different
(but	mathematically	linked)	to	the	key	used	to	encrypt	the	message.
Public	key	cryptography	is	described	as	an	asymmetric	scheme,	because
the	key	used	to	decrypt	the	message	is	
not
	the	same	as	the	key	used	to
encrypt	it.	This	makes	it	more	secure.
Using	asymmetric	cryptography,	if	you	want	to	receive	encrypted
messages	you	create	
two
	mathematically	linked	keys:	a	public	key	and	a
private	key.	Together	they	are	called	a	key	pair.	You	can	share	your	
public
key	with	the	world,	and	anyone	can	use	it	to	encrypt	messages	for	you.
You	use	your	
private
	key,	known	only	to	you,	to	decrypt	those	messages.
Anyone	who	sends	you	encrypted	messages	using	your	public	key	knows
that	
only	you
	can	decrypt	them.

As	we	have	seen,	one	of	the	biggest	problems	of	symmetric	cryptography
is	how	to	share	a	key	in	the	first	place	when	all	forms	of	communication
are	tapped.	It	is	hard	to	be	sure	that	you	can	share	a	decryption	key	with
your	friend	without	the	eavesdroppers	also	getting	that	key.	With	public
key	cryptography,	you	broadcast	your	public	key	to	everyone,	not	caring	if
the	eavesdroppers	can	see	it	or	not.	Your	friend	then	encrypts	the
message	and	sends	it	to	you.	Only	you	can	decrypt	it	because	only	you
have	the	private	key.	If	an	eavesdropper	gets	the	encrypted	message,	they
can’t	decrypt	it	because	they	don’t	have	your	private	key.	It	is	a	beautiful
system	and	a	huge	improvement	over	symmetric	schemes	because	you
never	need	to	communicate	a	shared	or	common	key.
What	do	keys	look	like?	There	are	number	of	different	schemes.	PGP
(Pretty	Good	Privacy)	is	a	scheme	originally	developed	in	the	1990’s	for
encrypting,	decrypting	and	digitally	signing	messages	such	as	emails.
This	scheme	was	so	powerful	that	the	US	Government	didn’t	like	it	and
had	it	classified	as	Munitions,	an	‘Auxiliary	Military	Equipment,’
meaning	that	anyone	found	exporting	it	from	the	US	would	be	in	deep
trouble.	Phil	Zimmermann,	the	creator	of	PGP,	found	a	way	around	this
by	publishing	the	source	code	as	a	hardback	book	using	First	Amendment
protection	of	the	export	of	books
68
.	This	marked	the	height	of	tensions
between	the	US	Government	and	individuals	who	are	passionate,	quite
rightly	so,	about	privacy.	To	learn	about	this	story	in	depth,	I	recommend
Steven	Levy’s	book	
Crypto
	which	documents	the	history	of	PGP	and	the
revolution	of	cryptography.
Back	to	public	and	private	keys.	I	downloaded	GPG	Suite
69
,	an	open
source	and	free	set	of	tools	that	conforms	to	the	OpenPGP	standards,	and
I	created	a	new	keypair.	Here	is	what	the	public	and	private	keys	look
like:








Of	course	this	specific	keypair	is	useless	now,	as	I	have	made	both	keys
available	to	the	public.
So	that	is	PGP.	Bitcoin	uses	a	different	scheme	called	‘ECDSA’—Elliptic
Curve	Digital	Signature	Algorithm.	It	works	like	this:
•
Pick	a	random	number	between	0	and	2256-1	(that,	written	out,	has
seventy-eight	digits:	115,	792,	089,	237,	316,	195,	423,	570,	985,	008,
687,	907,	853,	269,	984,	665,	640,	564,	039,	457,	584,	007,	913,	129,
639,	935).	
This	is	your	private
	
key.
•
Do	some	ECDSA	maths	on	it	to	generate	a	
public	key
.	The	ECDSA
algorithms	are	well	known	and	there	are	plenty	of	tools	to	help	with
the	calculations.
That	is	it!	You	now	have	a	randomly	chosen	private	key	and	you	have
mathematically	generated	a	public	key	from	it.	From	your	public	key	you
can	generate	your	Bitcoin	address	to	tell	the	world,	but	make	sure	you
don’t	tell	anyone	your	private	key.	Although	it	was	easy	for	you	to	convert
your	private	key	into	a	public	key	by	doing	some	ECDSA	maths	on	it,	it	is
mathematically	impossible	for	someone	to	‘work	backwards’	and	derive
your	private	key	from	your	public	key.
For	a	real	example,	go	to	
www.bitaddress.org
	and	wiggle	your	mouse	a	bit
to	generate	some	randomness.	I	did	it	with	the	following	result:
The	Bitcoin	address	is	derived	from	the	public	key.	By	pasting	the	private
key	into	the	‘Wallet	Details’	section	of	the	website,	you	can	see	all	of	the
gory	details	including	the	public	and	private	keys	in	various	formats:
Again,	of	course	this	keypair	is	useless	now	and	I	wouldn’t	recommend
sending	any	bitcoins	to	it!
So	there	you	have	it.	Bitcoin	addresses	(accounts)	are	derivatives	of
public	keys,	and	when	you	make	a	Bitcoin	transaction,	you	use	your
private	key	to	sign,	or	authorize,	the	transaction	which	moves	bitcoins
from	your	account	to	someone	else’s.	Most	blockchain	schemes	operate
this	way.	Digital	assets	are	held	in	accounts	made	from	public	keys,	and
the	respective	private	keys	are	used	for	signing	outbound	transactions.
HASHES
A	
hash	function
	is	a	series	of	mathematical	steps	or	
algorithms
	that	you
can	perform	on	some	
input
	data,	resulting	in	a	
fingerprint
,	or	
digest
,	or
simply,	a	
hash
.	There	are	
basic
	hash	functions	(not	used	in	blockchains)
and	
cryptographic
	hash	functions	(used	in	blockchains).
We’ll	need	to	understand	
basic
	hash	functions	before	moving	to
cryptographic	hash	functions.
Basic	Hash
	
Function
A	really	basic	hash	function	might	be	‘Use	the	first	character	of	the	input’.
So	using	this	function	you’d	get:	Hash(‘What	time	is	it?’)	=>	‘W’
The	input	to	this	function	is	‘What	time	is	it?’	and	is	sometimes	called	the
preimage
	or	the	
message
.
The	output	of	this	function	is	‘W’	and	is	called	the	
digest
,	the	
hash	value
,
or	simply	the	
hash
.
Hash	functions	are	
deterministic
	because	the	output	is	
determined
	by	the
input.	If	a	function	is	deterministic,	it	always	produces	the	same	output
for	any	given	input.	All	mathematical	functions	are	deterministic	(adding,
multiplying,	dividing,	etc).
Cryptographic	Hash
	
Functions
	A	
cryptographic
	hash	function	is
special	and	has	some	characteristics	that	makes	it	useful	in
cryptography	and	for	cryptocurrencies,	as	we	will	see	later.
Wikipedia
70
	states	that	the	ideal	cryptographic	hash	function
has	five	main	properties	(my	comments	in	parentheses):	
1.
It
is	deterministic	so	the	same	message	always	results	in	the
same	hash	
2.
It	is	quick	to	compute	the	hash	value	for	any
given	message	(you	can	easily	go	‘forwards’)	
3.
It	is	not
feasible	to	generate	a	message	from	its	hash	value	except	by
trying	all	possible	messages	(you	can’t	go	‘backwards’)	
4.
A
small	change	to	a	message	should	change	the	hash	value	so
extensively	that	the	new	hash	value	appears	uncorrelated	with
the	old	hash	value	(a	small	change	makes	a	big	difference)	
5.
It	is	not	feasible	to	find	two	different	messages	with	the	same
hash	value	(it	is	hard	to	create	a	hash	clash)	What	does	this
mean?	The	combination	of	properties	2	(you	can	easily	go
‘forwards’)	and	3	(you	can’t	go	‘backwards’)	means	that
cryptographic	functions	are	sometimes	called	‘trapdoor
function’.	It	is	easy	to	create	a	hash	from	a	message,	but	you
can’t	re-create	the	input	from	the	hash.	Nor	can	you	guess	or
infer	what	the	message	may	be	by	looking	at	the	hash	(property
4).	The	only	way	to	go	backwards	is	to	try	every	possible
combination	of	inputs	and	see	if	the	hash	value	matches	the
one	you	are	trying	to	reverse.	This	is	called	a	brute	force	attack.
So	would	our	previous	hash	function	(‘Use	the	first	character’)	be	a	good
cryptographic
	hash	function?	Let’s	see:	
1.
Yes,	it	is	deterministic.	‘What
time	is	it?’	always	hashes	to	‘W’.
2.
Yes,	it	is	quick	to	compute	the	output,	you	simply	take	the	first
character.
3.
Yes,	by	knowing	only	‘W’	it	is	not	feasible	to	guess	the	original
sentence	(but	see	5).
4.
No,	a	small	change	in	the	message	doesn’t	necessarily	change	the
output.	‘What	time	is	
a
t?’	also	hashes	down	to	‘W’.
5.
No,	we	can	easily	create	loads	of	inputs	that	will	all	hash	down	to	the
same	output.	Anything	starting	with	‘W’	will	work.
So	our	earlier	hash	function	is	no	good	as	a	cryptographic	hash	function.
So	what	is	a	good	cryptographic	hash	function?	There	are	some
established	industry	standard	cryptographic	hash	functions	that	meet	all
of	these	criteria.	They	have	names	like	MD5
71
	(Message	Digest)	or	SHA-
256	(Secure	Hash	Algorithm),	and	they	have	an	additional	benefit	in	that
their	output	is	usually	of	a	fixed	length.	This	means	that	whatever	you	use
as	an	input	to	the	hash	function,	whether	it	is	a	sentence,	a	file,	a	hard
drive,	or	an	entire	data	centre,	you	will	always	get	a	short	digest	back.
Here	is	the	kind	of	output	you	get:
You	can	even	try	this	on	your	computer.	If	you	have	a	Mac,	run	the
Terminal	application	and	type:	md5	-s	“What	time	is	it?”
or
echo	“What	time	is	it?”	|	shasum	-a	256
You	will	see	that	your	results	are	the	same	as	mine.	Of	course,	that	is	the
whole	point	in	a	cryptographic	hash—it	is	deterministic.
If	you	change	the	input	slightly,	you	get	a	very	different	result:
Hash	functions	can	be	used	for	proving	that	two	things	are	the	same
without	revealing	the	two	things.	For	example,	let’s	say	that	you	want	to
make	a	prediction	and	don’t	want	others	to	know	the	prediction,	but	you
want	to	be	able	to	reveal	the	prediction	later.	You’d	write	the	prediction
down	privately,	hash	it,	and	display	the	hash	to	your	audience.	People	can
see	that	you’ve	committed	to	a	prediction	but	can’t	back-calculate	what
your	prediction	is.	Later,	you	can	reveal	the	prediction,	and	others	can
calculate	the	hash	and	see	that	it	matches	the	hash	you	published.
Cryptographic
	hashes,	the	output	from	cryptographic	hash	functions,	are
used	in	Bitcoin	in	a	number	of	places:	
•
In	the	mining	process
•
As	identifiers	for	transactions
•
As	identifiers	for	blocks,	in	order	to	link	them	in	a	chain	
•
Ensuring	that	data	tampering	is	immediately	evident
DIGITAL SIGNATURES
Digital	signatures	are	used	extensively	in	Bitcoin	and	blockchains	for
creating	valid	transactions	‘signing’	transaction	messages	to	move	coins
from	your	account	to	someone	else’s.
What	are	digital	signatures,	in	a	cryptographic	sense?	Well,	we	can	afford
to	be	a	bit	pedantic	here.	
Digital	signatures
	are	a	subset	of	
electronic
signatures
,	which	can	take	a	number	of	forms.
One	form	of	electronic	signature	is	as	simple	typing	your	name	into	a
box:
	
This is an 
electronic
 signature but not a 
digital
 signature.
Another	form	of	electronic	signature	is	a	picture	that	looks	like	a	wet-ink
signature,	but	inserted	into	a	document:
This is also an 
electronic
 signature, but not a 
digital
 signature.
So	what	does	a	
digital	signature
	look	like?	I	created	a	small	message
containing	the	text	‘Here	is	a	message	I	want	to	sign’.	and	I	signed	it
using	the	(private)	PGP	key	I	generated	earlier.	Here	is	what	the
signature	looks	like:

So	that	is	a	digital	signature.	Looks	like	gibberish.	So	what’s	so	special
about	it?	What	does	it	prove?
A	digital	signature	is	created	by	taking	the	message	you	want	to	sign	and
applying	a	mathematical	formula	with	your	
private
	key.	Anyone	who
knows	your	
public
	key	can	mathematically	verify	that	this	signature	was
indeed	created	by	the	holder	of	the	associated	private	key	(but	without
knowing	the	private	key	itself).
So,	anyone	can	independently	validate	that	
this
	piece	of	data	was	signed
by	the	private	key	holder	of	
this
	public	key.
In	essence:
How	is	this	better	than	a	wet-ink-on-paper	signature?	The	problem	with
a	wet-ink	signature	is	that	it	is	independent	of	the	data	that	is	being
signed,	and	this	creates	two	problems:
1.
There	is	no	way	of	knowing	if	a	document	has	been	tampered	
after
your	signature	is	applied	to	the	bottom.
2.
Your	signature	can	easily	be	copied	and	re-used	with	other
documents,	without	your	knowledge.
Your	wet-ink-on-paper	signature	is	your	signature	and	doesn’t	change
based	on	the	item	being	signed:	when	you	sign	a	cheque,	a	letter,	or	a
document,	
the	whole	point
	is	that	your	signature	looks	the	same.	This	is
easy	for	other	people	to	copy!	This	is	really	terrible	security!
In	contrast,	a	digital	signature	is	only	valid	for	that	
exact
	piece	of	data,
and	so	it	cannot	be	copied	and	pasted	underneath	another	piece	of	data,
nor	can	someone	else	re-use	it	for	their	own	purposes.	Any	tampering
with	the	message	will	result	in	the	signature	being	invalidated.	The	digital
signature	is	a	one-time	‘proof’	that	the	person	with	the	private	key	really
did	approve	that	exact	message.	No	one	else	in	the	world	can	create	that
digital	signature	except	you,	unless	they	have	your	private	key.
Now,	just	to	explain	one	further	step,	the	mathematical	process	of
‘signing’	a	message	with	a	private	key	is	actually	an	encryption	process.
Remember	that	you	encrypt	data	with	a	public	key,	and	decrypt	it	with	a
private	key?	With	some	schemes	you	can	also	do	it	the	other	way	around:
you	can	encrypt	data	with	a	private	key	and	decrypt	it	with	a	public	key.
So	actually	the	validation	process	is	taking	the	digital	signature	and
decrypting	it	with	the	well-known	public	key,	and	seeing	that	the
decrypted	signature	matches	the	message	being	signed.
But	what	if	the	message	being	signed	is	really	big,	like,	say,	gigabytes	of
data?	Well,	you	don’t	want	a	really	long	digital	signature,	as	that	would	be
inefficient.	So	in	most	signing	schemes,	it	is	actually	the	
hash
(fingerprint)	of	the	message	that	is	signed	with	the	private	key	to	produce
a	digital	signature	which	is	small,	irrespective	of	the	size	of	the	data	being
signed.
There	is	a	good	summary	on	Microsoft’s	Technet	website
72
:
So	digital	signatures	can	be	used	to	authenticate	a	transaction	or
message,	as	well	as	to	ensure	data	integrity	of	the	message.	Also,	unless	a
private	key	has	been	copied,	it	is	impossible	afterwards	to	say	‘it	wasn’t
me’—this	property	is	called	‘non-repudiation’	and	provides	comfort	for
both	parties	to	a	transaction.
Digital	signatures	are	used	in	blockchain	transactions	because	they	prove
account	ownership,	and	the	validity	of	a	digital	signature	can	be	proven
mathematically	and	offline,	without	asking	any	other	party.	Compare	this
to	traditional	banking:	when	you	instruct	your	bank	to	make	a	payment,
you	first	authenticate	yourself	by	logging	in	to	the	bank’s	website,	or
showing	your	ID	to	a	bank	teller	in	person.	If	the	bank	believes	that	you
are	the	account	holder,	then	the	bank	executes	your	instruction	on	your
behalf.	In	a	blockchain	system,	where	there	is	deliberately	no
organisation	to	provide	or	maintain	accounts	for	you,	your	digital
signatures	are	the	critical	piece	of	evidence	that	entitle	you	to	make
signatures	are	the	critical	piece	of	evidence	that	entitle	you	to	make
transactions.
WHY ALICE AND BOB?
In	cryptography,	it	always	seems	to	be	Alice	and	Bob.	Why?	They	are
characters	first	used	by	Ron	Rivest,	Adi	Shamir,	and	Leonard	Adleman	in
their	1978	paper	‘A	method	for	obtaining	digital	signatures	and	public	key
cryptosystems’
73
	instead	of	a	drier	‘A’	and	‘B’.	Since	then,	people	use	these
characters	as	a	nod	to	the	inventors.
But	wait,	there’s	more…	Wikipedia
74
	has	a	list	of	commonly	used
characters,	and	here	are	a	few	I	am	fond	of:
•
Craig	the	password	cracker
•
Eve	the	eavesdropper
•
Grace	the	government	(generally	characterised	as	anti-cryptography)
•
Mallory	the	malicious	man-in-the-middle
•
Sybil	the	attacker	who	uses	a	lot	of	pseudonyms	to	overwhelm	Alice
and	Bob
So	there	you	go,	that	is	why	it	is	always	Alice	and	Bob.


Part 4
CRYPTOCURRENCIES
Where	do	we	start?	There	are	so	many	cryptocurrencies,	each	working
differently	with	different	rules	and	mechanisms,	that	is	it	not	particularly
easy	to	make	accurate	generalisations:	however	you	describe
cryptocurrencies,	there	are	bound	to	be	exceptions.	For	example,	Bitcoin
uses	a	mechanism	called	‘proof-of-work’	to	ensure	that	anyone	(in	theory,
at	least)	can	add	blocks	to	the	blockchain	at	a	certain	cadence	without	a
central	actor	coordinating	access	or	providing	permission.	Proof-of-work
creates	a	fair	competition	between	block	adders	who	compete	to	add
blocks.	This	competition	consumes	electricity—a	lot	of	it
75
—which	is	one
reason	some	people	describe	Bitcoin	as	wasteful.	However	not	all
cryptocurrencies,	and	certainly	not	all	blockchain	technologies,	work	this
way.	So	it	is	inaccurate	and	therefore	unhelpful	to	generalise	and	say
‘cryptocurrencies’	or	‘blockchains’	are	energy	intensive.	Just	because
Bitcoin	works	in	a	certain	way,	it	doesn’t	mean	everything	else	does.
Bearing	this	in	mind,	we	will	nevertheless	start	by	getting	a	good
grounding	in	how	Bitcoin	works,	and	then	later	describe	some	of	the
differences	between	Bitcoin	and	other	cryptocurrencies	and	their
respective	blockchain	protocols	(all	to	be	explained—do	not	fear!).
BITCOIN
People	refer	to	Bitcoin	as	a	digital	currency,	virtual	currency,	or
cryptocurrency,	but	it	may	be	easier	to	think	of	it	as	an	electronic	
asset
.
The	word	
currency
	often	side-tracks	people	when	they	are	trying	to
understand	Bitcoin.	They	get	caught	up	trying	to	understand	aspects	of
conventional	currencies	which	do	not	apply	to	Bitcoin,	for	example,	what
backs	it	(nothing)	and	who	sets	the	interest	rate	(there	is	none).	Bitcoin	is
also	sometimes	described	as	a	
digital	token
,	and	in	some	respects	that	is
accurate;	but,	alas,	the	term	
token
	is	now	also	used	to	mean	something
more	specific,	which	we	will	cover	later,	so	the	ambiguity	of	this	term	too
is	best	avoided.
What Are Bitcoins?
Bitcoins	are	digital	assets	(‘coins’)	whose	ownership	is	recorded	on	an
electronic	ledger	that	is	updated	(almost)	simultaneously	on	about
10,000	independently	operated	computers	around	the	world	that	connect
and	gossip	with	each	other
76
.	This	ledger	is	called	Bitcoin’s	blockchain.
Transactions	that	record	transfer	of	ownership	of	those	coins	are	created
and	validated	according	to	a	protocol—a	list	of	rules	that	define	how
things	work	and	which	therefore	govern	updates	to	the	ledger.	The
protocol	is	implemented	by	software
—an	app—that	participants	run	on
their	computers.	The	machines	running	the	apps	are	called	‘nodes’	of	the
network.	Each	node	independently	validates	all	pending	transactions
wherever	they	arise,	and	updates	its	own	record	of	the	ledger	with
validated	blocks	of	confirmed	transactions.	Specialist	nodes,	called
miners,	bundle	together	valid	transactions	into	blocks	and	distribute
those	blocks	to	nodes	across	the	network.
Anyone	can	buy	bitcoins,	own	them,	and	send	them	to	other	people.
Every	Bitcoin	transaction	is	recorded	and	shared	publicly	in	plain	text	on
Bitcoin’s	blockchain.	Contrary	to	many	media	articles,	Bitcoin’s
blockchain	is	
not
	encrypted.	By	design,	everyone	sees	all	details	of	all
transactions.	Anyone	can,	in	theory,	create	bitcoins	for	themselves	too.
This	is	part	of	the	block	creation	process,	called	
mining
,	and	is	described
later.
What Is the Point of Bitcoin?
The	purpose	of	Bitcoin	is	described	in	its	whitepaper—a	short	document
written	by	a	pseudonymous	Satoshi	Nakamoto,	published	in	October
2008.	It	describes	
why
	Bitcoin	exists	and	
how
	it	should	work.	It	is	worth
reading	the	whitepaper	in	full.	It	is	only	nine	pages	long	and	available
online
77
.	The	abstract	says:
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent
directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital
signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party
is still required to prevent double spending. We propose a solution to the double spending
problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing
them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be
changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of
the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.
As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack
the network, they’ll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself
requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can
leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of
what happened while they were
 
gone.
That	first	sentence	says	it	all.	It	sets	out	the	purpose	of	Bitcoin,	and	how
Bitcoin	derives	both	value	and	utility.	For	the	first	time	in	history,	we
have	a	system	that	can	send	value	from	A	to	B,	without	the	physical
movement	of	items	or	using	specific	third-party	intermediaries.	It	is
difficult	to	overstate	how	important	a	milestone	this	is	in	the	evolution	of
payments.	I	get	shivers	down	my	spine	every	time	I	think	of	Bitcoin	like
this
78
.	As	popularised	by	cryptocurrency	industry	commentator	Tim
Swanson
79
,	Bitcoin	is	designed	as	
censorship	resistant	digital
	
cash
.
There	is	no	mention	of	a	blockchain	or	‘block	chain’	at	all	in	the	original
Bitcoin	whitepaper,	even	though	we	are	constantly	reminded	by	the
media	that	Bitcoin	is	built	on	blockchain	or	that	blockchain	is	the
underlying	technology	of	Bitcoin.	A	chain	of	blocks	was	not	the	purpose
of	Bitcoin,	it	is	just	the	design	that	was	developed	to	achieve	the	objective
—the	solution	to	the	business	problem.
How Does Bitcoin Work?
The	Bitcoin	blockchain	is	managed	by	software	running	on	computers
that	communicate	with	each	other	forming	a	network.	Although	multiple
compatible	software	implementations	exist,	the	most	commonly	used
software	is	called	‘Bitcoin	Core’	and	source	code	to	this	software	is
published	on	GitHub
80
.	This	software	contains	the	full	range	of
functionalities	needed	for	the	network	to	exist.	It	has	the	ability	to
perform	the	following	tasks	which	will	be	explained	in	this	section:
•
Connect	with	other	participants	in	the	Bitcoin	network
•
Download	the	blockchain	from	other	participants
•
Store	the	blockchain
•
Listen	for	new	transactions
•
Validate	those	transactions
•
Store	those	transactions
•
Relay	valid	transactions	to	other	nodes
•
Listen	for	new	blocks
•
Validate	those	blocks
•
Store	those	blocks	as	part	of	its	blockchain
•
Relay	valid	blocks
•
Create	new	blocks
•
‘Mine’	new	blocks
•
Manage	addresses
•
Create	and	send	transactions
However,	in	practice,	the	software	is	usually	only	used	for	its
bookkeeping	function,	which	will	be	explained	in	depth	in	this	section.
To	understand	how	Bitcoin	works,	and	why	it	works	the	way	it	does,	it	is
important	to	keep	in	mind	the	objective:	to	create	an	electronic	payment
system	that	cannot	be	censored,	and	to	allow	anyone	the	ability	to	send
payments	‘
directly	from	one	party	to	another	without	going	through	a
financial
	
institution
’.
Such	a	system	cannot	have	a	central	administrator	managing	the	ledger,
as	that	administrator	would	be	the	financial	institution	that	Bitcoin	is	set
up	to	avoid.	The	system	therefore	needs	to	be	able	to	be	operated	by
anyone,	without	any	need	to	identify	themselves	or	gain	permission	from
a	gatekeeper.	The	moment	that	parties	need	to	identify	themselves,	they
lose	privacy	and	are	vulnerable	to	interference,	coercion,	prison,	or
worse.	This	goes	for	both	administrators	of	the	system	and	users
themselves.	So	every	single	part	of	the	solution	needs	to	work	with	these
constraints	in	mind.
How	did	Satoshi	go	about	designing	the	solution?	Let’s	start	with	a	classic
centralised	model	and	then	try	to	decentralise	it.	In	this	way,	we	can	build
up	the	design	of	Bitcoin	step	by	step.
Classic	Centralised
	
Model
Let’s	start	with	a	ledger	which	keeps	tracks	of	balances,	managed	by	an
administrator.	You	can	think	of	it	as	a	list	with	two	columns:	Account,
Balance
81
.
Classic	centralized	model
Bookkeeper
Account
Balance
000001
$100
000002
$50
000003
$240
	
The	administrator	assigns	account	numbers	to	customers,	and	customers
make	payments	by	instructing	the	administrator.	There	is	an
authentication	process	where	the	customer	proves	that	they	are	the
account	holder	before	the	administrator	will	carry	out	the	payment
instruction.	So	each	customer	is	named	and,	for	security,	has	a	password
linked	to	their	account.
Account	mapping
Account
Username
Pin/Password
000001
Alice
1234
000002
Bob
8888
000003
Charlie
9876
	
The	administrator	maintains	the	central	record	of	balances	and	makes	all
payments.	They	are	responsible	for	ensuring	that	no	one	spends	money
they	don’t	have	or	spends	the	same	money	more	than	once,	the	‘double
spend’.
But	if	we	want	resistance	to	control	and	censorship,	and	to	allow	anyone
to	be	able	to	transact	with	anyone	else,	
we	need	to	remove	the
administrator
.
First,	let’s	remove	the	administrator	from	the	
account	opening
	process,
so	that	anyone	can	open	an	account	without	needing	permission	from	the
administrator.
Problem:	Accounts	Need
	
Permission
Someone	has	to	set	up	an	account	and	assign	it	to	you.	It	is	the
administrator’s	job	to	assign	you	an	unused	account	number	then	set	you
up	with	some	sort	of	username	(which	may	be	your	own	name)	and
password	so	that	when	you	ask	the	administrator	to	make	a	payment	on
your	behalf,	the	administrator	knows	it	is	really	you	making	the	request.
In	setting	up	your	account	the	administrator	has	
granted	permission
	for
you	to	open	the	account,	and	may,	equally,	choose	to	refuse	that
permission.	Any	time	you	have	an	entity	that	can	approve	or	deny
something,	you	have	a	point	of	third	party	control.	We	are	trying	to
eliminate	third	party	control.
Is	there	a	way	you	can	open	an	account	without	having	to	ask
permission?	Well,	cryptography	provides	a	solution.
Solution:	Use	Public	Keys	as	Account
	
Numbers
Instead	of	names	or	account	numbers	and	passwords,	why	not	use	public
keys	as	the	account	number,	and	digital	signatures	instead	of	passwords?
By	using	public	keys	as	account	numbers,	anyone	can	create	their	own
accounts	with	their	own	computer	without	having	to	ask	an	administrator
for	an	account	number.	Remember,	a	public	key	is	derived	from	a	private
key,	which	is	a	number	picked	at	random.	So	you	create	an	account	by
picking	a	random	number	(your	private	key)	and	doing	some	maths	on	it
to	get	your	public	key.	In	Bitcoin	and	most	other	cryptocurrencies,
account	numbers	are	mathematically	derived	from	public	keys	(not
public	keys	themselves),	and	are	called	
addresses
.

You	can	tell	the	world	this	Bitcoin	address	to	allow	people	to	pay	to	it
82
.
No	one	can	spend	anything	from	it	unless	they	have	the	private	key,
which	only	you	have.	You	can	also	create	as	many	addresses	as	you	want
and	your	wallet	software	will	manage	all	of	them	for	you.
Could	someone	else	already	be	using	an	address	that	you	randomly
picked?	Possible,	but	unlikely.	We	saw	in	the	cryptography	section	that
Bitcoin’s	scheme	uses	a	random	number	between	0	and
115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,935
as	a	private	key.	There	are	so	many	private	keys	available	that	the
possibility	of	stumbling	across	someone	else’s	account	is	virtually	nil.	As
one	commentator	put	it,	‘Go	back	to	bed	and	don’t	worry	about	this	ever
happening’.	
83
Public/private	keypairs	also	solve	the	authentication	problem.	You	don’t
have	to	log	in	to	prove	that	you	are	the	account	holder.	When	sending	a
payment	instruction	you	digitally	sign	the	transaction	with	your	private
key,	and	this	signature	proves	to	the	administrator	that	the	instruction	is
indeed	coming	from	you,	the	account	holder.	You	can	create	and	sign	the
transaction	offline	without	being	connected	to	any	network.	When	you
broadcast	the	signed	transaction	to	the	administrator,	all	the
administrator	has	to	do	is	check	that	the	digital	signature	is	valid	for	the
respective	account	number,	rather	than	maintain	a	list	of	usernames	and
passwords	for	you	and	all	transacting	parties.
Problem:	Single	Central
	
Bookkeeper
We	have	now	eliminated	the	role	of	the	third-party	administrator	in
creating
	accounts.	But	we	still	have	the	third-party	administrator	in	the
role	of	central	bookkeeper—the	coordinator	who	maintains	the	list	of
transactions	and	balances	and	who	both	validates	and	orders	the
transactions	you	request	against	some	business	and	technical	rules.	This
single	point	of	control	ultimately	decides	what	is	reflected	in	your
account,	whether	your	transaction	goes	through	or	not.	As	a	single	point
of	control,	it	is	classified	as	a	financial	institution,	and	has	the	regulatory
burden	of	having	to	identify	you	and	all	other	customers,	a	process
known	as	Know	Your	Customer	or	KYC.	It	can	also	be	coerced	to	censor
transactions.
So,	for	a	digital	cash	system	resistant	to	third	party	influence,	including
control	and	censorship,	we	need	to	remove	that	single	point	of	control
84
.
Solution:	Replicate	the
	
Books
The	more	people	you	have	sharing	a	secure	system	and	its	information,
the	less	vulnerable	that	information	is	to	manipulation.	However,	a	group
of	‘trusted	bookkeepers’	would	inevitably	require	their	own	gatekeeper,
so	we	would	be	back	to	the	central	point	of	control	problem	again.	The
solution	is	for	
anyone	anywhere
	to	be	able	to	be	a	bookkeeper	without
asking	permission	from	anyone	else	and	without	hierarchy.	And	all
bookkeepers,	wherever	they	are,	maintain	the	same	complete	books	of
record	and	are	
peers
	of	equal	seniority,	with	checks	and	balances	such
that	if	any	single	bookkeeper	were	forced	to	try	to	censor	a	transaction	or
manipulate	the	database,	the	others	would	ignore	or	exclude	them.
As	long	as	all	bookkeepers	maintain	identical	records	of	which
transactions	are	included	and	which	excluded,	we	have	a	more	resilient
system.	If	any	individual	bookkeeper	is	forced	to	stop	work,	the	others
can	continue.	Anyone	is	able	to	join	this	network	of	bookkeepers	without
needing	permission	from	anyone	else.	So	the	network	is	resilient	to
anyone	joining	or	leaving	at	any	time.
In	Bitcoin,	any	individual	with	a	computer,	adequate	storage,	and	access
to	internet	bandwidth	can	download	some	software	(or	write	their	own),
connect	to	a	few	neighbours,	and	become	a	bookkeeper.
New	transactions	are	broadcast	to	all	bookkeepers	via	a	gossip	network,
and	each	bookkeeper	relays	new	transactions	to	as	many	others	as	they
are	connected	to.	This	ensures	eventual	propagation	of	transactions	to	all
bookkeepers.
Problem:	Transaction
	
Ordering
How	do	multiple	bookkeepers	stay	in	sync	with	each	other?	Every
bookkeeper	will	have	a	different	idea	of	the	order	of	transactions.	Given
that	there	could	be	hundreds	of	transactions	being	created	anywhere	in
that	there	could	be	hundreds	of	transactions	being	created	anywhere	in
the	world,	and	given	that	it	takes	some	time	for	these	to	fully	propagate
across	the	network,	if	every	bookkeeper	tried	to	put	these	transactions	in
order,	there	would	be	many	conflicting	versions	of	the	‘correct’	order	of
transactions.	What	happens	if	a	bookkeeper	in	China	receives	transaction
A	then	transaction	B,	whereas	a	bookkeeper	in	the	USA	receives
transaction	B	first,	then	A?
Geography,	technology,	connectivity,	internet	traffic,	servers,	and
bandwidth	all	influence	the	speed	and	order	in	which	transactions
originating	anywhere	in	the	world	manifest	themselves	everywhere	else.
Your
	ordered	list	of	transactions	as	manifest,	say,	in	London	is	going	to
be	very	different	from	someone	else’s	list,	even	next	door,	let	alone	in,
say,	Lagos,	New	York,	Auckland,	or	Nairobi.
How	do	we	get	an	agreed	ordering	of	transactions?
Solution:	Blocks
We	can’t	control	how	many	transactions	can	be	
created
	per	second,	but
we	can	control	the	
data	entry	
into	the	ledgers.	We	can	do	this	by
recording	transactions	in	batches,	
page	by	page
	instead	of	transaction	by
transaction.	Individual	transactions,	validated	as	‘pending’	transactions,
can	be	passed	around	the	network,	then	entered	into	the	books	in	less
frequent	batches.	We	call	these	batches	
blocks
!
Blocks	are	created	much	less	frequently	than	transactions,	so	it	is	more
likely	that	a	block	reaches	all	bookkeepers	in	the	network	before	another
one	is	created.	This	means	that	a	bookkeeper	now	performs	two
functions:
1.
Validating	and	propagating	‘pending’	transactions
2.
Validating,	storing,	and	propagating	blocks	of	transactions
By	slowing	down	the	‘data	entry’	process	of	the	bookkeeping	system,
bookkeepers	around	the	world	have	more	time	to	agree	on	the	ordering	of
blocks	of	transactions.	So	rather	than	all	bookkeepers	needing	to	agree	on
the	order	of	
transactions
,	they	need	to	agree	on	the	order	of	
blocks
	which
are	generated	less	frequently.	Because	there	is	more	time	to	agree	on	the
order	of	blocks,	there	are	fewer	differences	in	opinion	about	block
ordering,	and	so	a	greater	chance	of	network-wide	consensus.	Later	we
will	see	how	the	network	deals	with	conflicting	blocks.
Once	your	transaction	is	bundled	along	with	other	transactions	into	a
valid	block,	and	that	block	is	passed	around	the	network,	the	transaction
is	said	to	be	‘confirmed’	with	one	confirmation.	When	the	next	block	is
added,	on	top	of	the	block	with	your	transaction,	your	transaction	is
confirmed	with	two	confirmations.	As	new	blocks	arrive	on	top	of	the
initial	block,	your	transaction	is	deeper	in	the	ledger	and	becomes	more
and	more	confirmed.	This	is	important	because	there	are	situations
where	the	very	top	of	the	chain,	i.e.,	the	newest	blocks,	may	be	replaced
by	other	blocks,	kicking	out	transactions	which	looked	like	they	have
already	been	confirmed
85
.	We	will	look	into	the	‘longest	chain	rule’	later.
There	is	a	trade-off	between	the	ease	with	which	bookkeepers	can	agree
on	the	ordering	of	transactions	and	the	speed	at	which	valid	transactions
are	written	into	the	blockchain.	Having	blocks	created,	say,	once	per	day
would	make	it	very	easy	for	all	bookkeepers	to	agree	on	the	ordering	of
those	blocks,	but	this	is	longer	than	people	want	to	wait	for	their
transactions	to	be	confirmed.
In	Bitcoin,	blocks	are	created	every	10	minutes	on	average.	Different
cryptocurrencies	have	different	block	creation	target	times.
Problem:	Who	Can	Create	Blocks,	and	How
	
Often?
We	have	seen	that	it	makes	sense	to	batch	pending	transactions	into
We	have	seen	that	it	makes	sense	to	batch	pending	transactions	into
blocks	that	are	propagated	around	the	network.	Bookkeepers	add	those
blocks	to	their	own	ledgers.	As	we	will	see	later,	if	there	are	discrepancies
or	competing	blocks,	they	use	the	‘longest	chain	rule’	to	decide	which
block	wins.
Firstly,	we	need	to	manage	the	creation	and	frequency	of	blocks.	How	can
we	do	this?	If	one	party	gathers	up	all	the	pending	transactions,	puts
them	into	blocks,	and	sends	the	blocks	to	all	the	bookkeepers	then	we	are
back	to	a	single,	centralised	control	point,	which	we	have	set	out	to	avoid.
So	anyone,	without	permission,	needs	to	be	able	to	create	blocks	and	send
them	around	the	network.	But	then	how	do	we	control	the	speed	at	which
blocks	are	created?	How	do	we	get	a	bunch	of	anonymous	block-creators
to	take	it	in	turns	and	ensure	that	they	don’t	create	blocks	too	quickly	or
too	slowly?
Could	the	bookkeepers	themselves	have	a	rule	to	accept	blocks	only	a
minimum	ten	minutes	after	the	last	block	they	saw,	to	make	it	pointless
for	someone	to	try	to	create	blocks	at	more	frequent	intervals?	Due	to	the
latency	of	the	internet,	this	may	create	some	unfair	advantages	(we	don’t
know	the	precise	time	when	any	individual	bookkeeper	received	the	latest
block,	and	we	can’t	trust	timestamps	on	blocks	because	these	can	be
easily	faked),	and	we	also	can’t	trust	the	individual	bookkeepers	who
might	alter	this	rule,	or	their	computer’s	clock,	and	accept	their	own
blocks	sooner	than	10	minutes.
Perhaps,	we	could	have	a	conductor,	an	entity	whose	job	is	to	randomly
assign	the	next	block-creator,	who	allows	the	next	block	to	be	created
only	10	minutes	after	the	previous	one?	No,	that	would	not	work	either,
as	the	conductor	would	be	a	central	point	of	control	over	the	network,
and	we	don’t	want	a	central	point	of	control.
So	perhaps	each	block-creator	could	be	randomly	assigned,	like	rolling
So	perhaps	each	block-creator	could	be	randomly	assigned,	like	rolling
some	virtual	dice	so	whoever	gets	a	‘double	six’	is	the	next	block	maker.
But	that	wouldn’t	work—how	could	anyone	prove	they	have	or	haven’t
cheated?	Who	would	roll	the	dice?	How	do	we	randomise	the	next	block-
creator	and	ensure	that	everyone	agrees	that	it	was	a	fair	process?
Solution:	Proof-of-Work
The	solution	is	extremely	elegant.	The	solution	is	that	all	block-creators
have	to	play	and	win	at	a	game	of	chance,	a	game	that	in	aggregate,	over
the	whole	network,	takes	some	specific	amount	of	time	to	play	(say	10
minutes	on	average).
The	game	must	give	all	block-creators	an	equal	chance	of	winning.	The
game	must	not	have	a	barrier	to	entry,	else	the	gatekeeper	would	be	a
central	point	of	control.	The	game	must	not	have	shortcuts,	and	the	game
needs	to	have	a	publicly	displayable	proof	so	that	the	winner	can	prove
they	have	won.	The	game	must	not	be	cheatable.
The	prize?	Being	allowed	to	create	the	next	block.
The	game	of	chance	that	Bitcoin	uses	is	called	‘proof-of-work’.	Each
block-creator	takes	a	bunch	of	transactions	that	they	know	about,	but
which	have	not	yet	been	included	in	any	previous	blocks,	and	builds	a
block	out	of	them,	in	a	specific	format.	The	creator	then	calculates	a
cryptographic	hash	from	the	block’s	data
86
.	Remember	that	a	hash	is	just
a	number.	The	rule	of	Bitcoin’s	proof-of-work	game	of	chance	says,	
if	the
hash	of	the	block	is	smaller	than	a	target	number
,	then	this	block	is
considered	a	valid	block	which	all	bookkeepers	should	accept
87
.
What	if	the	hash	of	the	block	is	bigger	than	this	number?	Does	the
specific	block-creator	bow	out	for	this	turn?	No.	The	block-creator	needs
to	alter	the	data	going	in	to	the	hash	function	and	try	hashing	the	block
again.	They	
could
	do	this	by	removing	a	transaction	from	the	block,	or
adding	a	new	transaction,	or	changing	the	order	of	transactions	in	the
block,	but	these	are	not	elegant	and	eventually	you	might	run	out	of
permutations.	You	don’t	really	want	to	mess	around	with	the	transactions
in	a	block.
The	solution	in	Bitcoin	is	that	in	every	Bitcoin	block	there	is	a	special	part
of	the	block	that	block-creators	can	populate	with	an	arbitrary	number.
Its	only	purpose	is	to	allow	block-creators	to	fill	it	with	a	number,	and
change	the	number	if	the	hash	block	doesn’t	meet	the	‘hash	is	smaller
than	a	target	number’	rule.	So,	if	the	first	hash	attempt	doesn’t	result	in	a
winning	hash,	then	they	can	just	change	the	number	in	this	part	of	the
block.	This	number	is	called	the	‘nonce’	(number	once)	and	is	completely
separate	from	the	financial	transactions	in	the	block.	Its	only	job	is	to
change	the	input	data	for	the	hash	function.

So	each	block-creator	puts	together	a	block	and	fills	the	nonce	field	with
the	number	and	hashes	the	block.	If	the	result	meets	the	‘hash	is	less	than
a	target	number’	rule	for	valid	blocks,	then	they	have	created	a	valid
block,	and	can	send	it	to	the	bookkeepers,	and	get	to	work	on	the	next
block.	If	the	result	doesn’t	fit	the	rule,	then	they	change	the	nonce	(e.g.,
by	adding	1)	and	hash	again.	They	do	this	repeatedly	until	they	find	a
valid	block.	This	is	a	process	known	as	
mining
.
This	is	elegantly	described	as	a	scratch-off	puzzle	in	a	paper	by	Miller	et
al	entitled	“Nonoutsourceable	Scratch-Off	Puzzles	to	Discourage	Bitcoin
Mining	Coalitions”
88
.	Like	scratch-off	lottery	cards,	each	miner	has	to
expend	a	bit	of	effort	scratching	off	a	puzzle	to	see	if	they	have	a	winning
ticket.
So	the	authority	to	create	a	valid	block	is	not	given	by	a	third	party	but	is
self-assigned	by	repeating	some	tedious	mathematical	algorithms,	which
all	computers	can	do
89
.	Note	that	mining	is	a	
tedious,	repetitive	job
.	Take
some	transactions	with	the	nonce,	hash	it,	see	if	the	hash	is	smaller	than	a
certain	number,	and	if	not,	repeat	with	a	different	nonce.	It	is	not	‘
solving
complex	mathematical	problems
’	as	is	widely	described	in	the	media.
Hashing	is	easy	but	boring!	You	can	even	do	it	by	hand	using	pencil	and
paper	if	you	have	the	patience,	though	you	would	be	unlikely	to	win	a
block	with	only	these	tools	to	power	you.	Ken	Shiriff	did	a	round	of
hashing	by	hand	with	pencil	and	paper	without	a	calculator,	and	you	can
watch	him	do	it	on	his	blog
90
.
In	this	way,	anyone	can	be	a	block-creator	and	create	valid	blocks.	They
then	send	the	valid	blocks	to	the	bookkeepers.	The	only	thing	that	the
bookkeepers	have	to	do	is	to	take	the	block,	including	the	nonce,	and
hash	it	once	to	verify	for	themselves	that	the	hash	of	the	block	is	less	than
the	target	number.
Proof-of-work	also	avoids	another	kind	of	attack,	a	Sybil	attack.	A	Sybil
91
attack	is	when	a	network	is	overwhelmed	by	multiple	forged	identities	all
under	the	control	of	a	single	actor.	Think	Facebook	or	Twitter	bots…
loads	of	usernames	but	all	under	control	of	a	small	number	of	bad	actors.
In	Bitcoin,	your	chance	of	winning	a	block	is	proportional	to	how	much
hashing	power	you	control.	In	the	Bitcoin	whitepaper	this	described	as
‘one-CPU-one-vote’.	If	Bitcoin	had	given	each	
node
	(each	block-adder)	an
equal	chance	of	winning	a	block	(one	node,	one	vote),	the	Sybil	attack
would	be	to	create	unlimited	numbers	of	block	adders	and	try	to	win	all
the	blocks.	Creating	multiple	identities	is	very	cheap	for	attackers	to	do.
So	proof-of-work	works	well	as	a	solution	to	this	kind	of	Sybil	attack
because	proof-of-work	is	
computationally	expensive
,	and	this	in	turn
means	expensive	in	terms	of	
electricity
	and	
hardware
	(i.e.,	cash),	which
means	it	is	expensive	to	try	to	overwhelm	the	network	with	hashing
power,	which	in	turn	increases	the	attack	costs	to	a	bad	actor.	If	you	have
all	of	this	hashing	power	available,	you	might	as	well	put	it	to	work
finding	blocks	and	making	money	(well,	bitcoins)	instead	of	trying	to
subvert	the	network,	so	the	theory	goes.
Problem:	Incentivising	Block-Creators
But	all	of	this	tedious	hashing	needs	resources:	computers,	electricity,
bandwidth…	and	this	all	costs	money.	Why	should	anyone	bother
creating	blocks?	What’s	in	it	for	them?	How	can	we	incentivise	the	block-
creators	to	create	blocks	and	keep	the	system	running?
Solution:	Transaction
	
Fees
The	solution	is	to	pay	the	block-creators	for	their	time	and	resources!	But
who	is	going	to	pay	them	and	in	what	currency?	An	external	payment	or
incentivisation	mechanism,	i.e.,	a	third	party	paying	the	block-creators,
would	centralise	and	gate	the	process,	defeating	the	purpose	of
would	centralise	and	gate	the	process,	defeating	the	purpose	of
censorship	resistance,	so	that	will	not	work.	US	dollars	or	any	fiat
currency	would	not	work	either,	as	fiat	is	held	in	bank	accounts	and
banks	can	be	instructed	to	freeze	accounts.
An	
internal
	or	
intrinsic
	incentivisation	scheme	avoids	third	party	control.
This	is	implemented	as	a	per	transaction	fee,	so	the	block-creator	gets	a
commission,	a	small	amount	of	value,	from	each	transaction.	This	could
be	specified	as	a	percentage	or	a	flat	rate	for	all	transactions	and	encoded
into	the	rules	of	the	system—a	bit	like	the	‘10	minutes	per	block’	rule.	But
it	is	difficult	to	establish	the	right	fee.	Bitcoin’s	solution	is	a	market-based
approach	where	people	creating	transactions	add	their	own	voluntary
transaction	fees,	and	the	block-creators	can	prioritise	those	transactions
with	higher	fees	over	those	with	lower	fees.
When	Alice	creates	her	Bitcoin	transaction	she	can	optionally	add	a	fee
that	is	collected	by	the	lucky	who	mines	her	transaction
92
.	This	fee	allows
miners	to	prioritise	her	transaction	over	others,	who	are	all	competing	to
get	in	a	block.	Blocks	are	limited	by	network	rules,	as	to	how	much	data
can	squeeze	into	a	block.	In	Bitcoin,	this	limit	is	nominally	1	MB
93
.	Fees
tend	to	go	up	in	times	where	there	are	many	transactions	queuing	up	to
get	into	blocks,	and	down	again	in	times	with	fewer	transactions.
Problem:	How	to
	
Bootstrap?
How	were	block-creators	incentivised	to	keep	creating	blocks	in	the	early
days	or,	indeed,	now	during	slack	periods	when	there	may	be	periods
where	there	are	no	transactions	for	some	hours?	The	hashing	work
consumes	electricity	and	costs	miners’	money.
Solution:	Block
	
Rewards
The	second,	and	currently	much	larger,	incentive	for	block-creators	to
create	blocks	is	the	‘
block	reward
’.	In	effect,	the	block-creator	can	write	a
cheque	to	themselves	once	per	block,	for	up	to	a	certain	amount.	The	idea
is	that	block	rewards	can	kick	start	the	system,	and	then	be	phased	out
gradually,	with	transaction	fees	to	replace	them.
The	very	first	transaction	in	a	block	is	called	the	
coinbase
	transaction
94
.
This	coinbase	transaction	is	special	because	it	is	the	only	transaction	that
creates	bitcoins.	All	other	transactions	move	bitcoins	between	addresses.
The	block-creator	can	create	a	transaction	that	pays	any	address	(usually
themselves)	any	number	of	bitcoins,	up	to	a	limit	specified	by	the	Bitcoin
protocol.	This	limit	was	50	BTC	per	block	in	2009	and	reduces	by	half
every	210,000	blocks,	which	at	10	minutes	per	block,	is	about	every	4
years.	Currently	(mid-2018)	the	maximum	block	reward	is	12.5	BTC,	with
the	next	reduction	to	occur	on	block	630,000,	estimated	to	occur	in	May
2020
95
.	These	block	rewards	have	created	around	17	million	bitcoins	to
date,	and	owing	to	the	repeated	halving	of	the	block	reward,	the
maximum	number	of	bitcoins	created	ever	will	be	a	sliver	under	21
million,	the	last	of	which	should	be	created	a	little	before	the	year	2140.
Unless	the	rules	change.
This	block	reward	is	the	mechanism	that	keeps	block-creators	creating
blocks.	They	receive	valuable	BTC	in	return	for	spending	resources	doing
the	tedious	hashing	to	create	valid	blocks.	Note	that	block-creators	are
under	no	obligation	to	include	any	transactions	in	their	blocks,	but	they
choose	to	because	the	transactions	themselves	contain	transaction	fees
and	these	also	accrue	to	the	block-creator.
The	beauty	of	this	system	is	that	the	payment	for	creating	blocks	comes
from	the	protocol	itself	rather	than	from	an	external	third	party.
Problem:	More	Hashing,	Faster	Blocks,	More	Monetary
	
Supply
If	anyone	can	create	valid	blocks	by	finding	the	nonce	that	makes	the
hash	of	the	block	meet	a	certain	criterion	and	get	paid	for	it,	then	surely
by	throwing	more	computers	at	the	hashing	they	can	create	valid	blocks
more	quickly	and	get	paid	more!	By	doubling	the	amount	of	hashing
power,	they	can,	on	average,	double	the	speed	at	which	they	can	create
valid	blocks.
But	this,	unchecked,	would	cause	havoc.	With	more	people	throwing
more	hashing	power	(i.e.,	computers)	at	the	block	creation	process,
blocks	would	be	created	faster	and	faster.	Remember,	we	want	blocks	to
be	created	slowly,	so	that	the	bookkeepers	have	a	better	chance	of	staying
in	consensus.	And	BTC	would	be	created	faster	and	faster,	creating	a	huge
supply	and	possibly	decreasing	the	value	of	each	unit.
Solution:	Difficulty
The	network	needs	to	self-correct	and	slow	down	if	blocks	are	created
more	quickly	than	the	target	of	one	block	every	ten	minutes.	The	answer
more	quickly	than	the	target	of	one	block	every	ten	minutes.	The	answer
lies	in	changing	the	target	number	for	the	hash	calculation.	Variations	in
this	target	number	can	make	it	easier	or	harder	for	the	network,	in
aggregate,	to	find	hashes	that	fall	below	this	number.	As	an	analogy,	if
you	have	to	roll	two	dice	and	get	a	sum	total	below	eight,	that	is	quite
easy,	but	if	you	have	to	get	a	sum	total	below	four	then	that	will	take	you
more	rolls.	So	making	the	target	number	smaller	slows	down	the	rate	at
which	valid	blocks	are	created.
In	Bitcoin,	the	target	number	is	mathematically	calculated	from	a
number	called	the	‘difficulty’.	The	difficulty	changes	every	2016	blocks
(which	takes	about	two	weeks	at	ten	minutes	per	block),	according	to	a
formula	that	uses	the	elapsed	time	it	took	to	mine	the	previous	2016
blocks.	The	faster	the	previous	2016	blocks	were	created,	the	more	the
difficulty	increased.	The	difficulty	and	the	hashing	target	number	are
inversely	related,	so	as	difficulty	increases,	the	target	number	becomes
smaller,	making	it	harder	and	therefore	slower	to	find	valid	blocks.
The	network	is	beautifully	self-balancing.	If	more	hashing	or	mining
power	is	added,	then	blocks	get	created	faster	for	a	period	of	time	until
the	next	difficulty	change,	after	which	it	becomes	harder	to	find	valid
blocks,	slowing	block	creation	down.	If	mining	power	leaves	the	network,
then	blocks	take	longer	to	be	found,	until	the	next	time	the	difficulty
changes,	then	difficulty	decreases,	and	blocks	become	easier	to	find.	And
this	is	all	done	without	a	central	coordinator.
Problem:	Block
	
Ordering
Transactions	are	bundled	into	blocks	which	are	like	pages	in	a	ledger.
These	blocks	are	passed	around	the	network	at	a	slower	rate	than
individual	pending	transactions	would	be.	But	how	do	you	know	what
order	the	blocks	should	be?	In	a	book,	each	page	has	a	unique	page
number,	and	you	know	that	the	pages	follow	in	ascending	order.	If	the
pages	fall	out,	you	can	put	the	book	back	together	again	in	the	right	order.
Could	the	same	be	done	for	blocks	where	each	block	gets	a	unique	‘block
number’?	In	principle,	yes,	but	remember	that	block-creators	are
competing	to	mine	blocks	by	hashing	their	contents	and	seeing	if	the
competing	to	mine	blocks	by	hashing	their	contents	and	seeing	if	the
hash	is	smaller	than	a	target	number	determined	by	the	current	difficulty.
Imagine	that	the	block	1,000	has	just	been	mined	and	passed	to	all	the
nodes.	The	miners	start	mining	block	1,001.	Someone	super	sneaky	might
get	to	work	mining	block	1,002	and	to	try	to	get	ahead	of	competitors,	so
that	as	soon	as	someone	else	has	found	block	1,001,	they	can	submit
block	1,002	and	claim	the	block	reward.	Remember,	the	miner	doesn’t
need	to	populate	any	transactions	in	the	block,	they	can	just	hash	an
empty	block	1,002	that	refers	to	block	1,001	with	a	coinbase	reward
transaction	and	no	other	transactions.	Hmm,	that	wouldn’t	be	a	good
idea,	there’d	be	all	sorts	of	gamesmanship.
What	restricts	miners	to	ensure	they	mine	only	the	very	next	block?	How
is	‘mining	ahead’	prevented?
Solution:	A	Block
	
Chain!
Instead	of	having	each	block	have	a	‘block	number,’	each	block	refers	to
the	previous	block	
by	its	hash
.	Miners	must	include	the	previous	block’s
hash	in	the	block	they	are	creating.
This	means	that	to	mine	block	1,002,	miners	need	to	know	the	hash	of
block	1,001.	Until	1,001	has	been	mined,	1,002	can’t	be	mined.	This
forces	miners	to	focus	on	block	1,001,	which	in	turn	includes	the	hash	of
block	1,000,	and	no	miner	can	skip	ahead.	Thus	a	chain	of	blocks	is
created,	held	together	not	by	block	
numbers
	(which	can	be	predicted)	but
by	block	
hashes
	(which	can’t).	Each	block	refers	to	a	previous	block	by	the
previous	block’s	hash,	rather	than	by	a	number	that	goes	up	sequentially.
This	is	the	chain	of	blocks,	or	
blockchain
.
A block chain
96
 where each block includes the hash of the previous block, rather
than a sequential block number.
An	additional	benefit	of	blocks	linking	through	their	hashes	is	that	of
internal	consistency,	sometimes	described	as	immutability.	Let’s	say	the
latest	block	that	has	been	passed	around	the	network	is	block	1,000.	If	a
rogue	bookkeeper	attempts	to	tamper	with	a	previous	block,	say,	block
990,	and	attempts	to	republish	that	block	to	other	bookkeepers,	they
could:
1.
Publish	block	990	with	new	data	but	using	the	old	hash;	
or
2.
publish	block	990	with	new	data	and	a	new	valid	hash	(i.e.,	‘re-mine’
the	block).
In	the	first	case,	the	block	will	be	considered	invalid	by	all	other
bookkeepers,	because	it	is	internally	inconsistent	(the	block’s	hash
doesn’t	match	the	data	inside	it),	and	in	the	second	case,	the	hash	of
block	990	won’t	match	the	reference	found	in	block	991.	Thus,	it	is	very
hard	to	get	away	with	tampering	with	any	records	that	already	form	part
of	the	blockchain—it	will	be	immediately	obvious	to	anyone	who	you	try
to	convince.	This	is	what	is	meant	when	blockchains	are	described	as
immutable
.	Of	course,	nothing	is	immutable	(can’t	be	changed),	but
blockchains	are	tamper-evident—that	is,	it	is	easy	for	others	to	tell	if	data
has	been	modified,	accidentally	or	otherwise.
Problem:	Block	Clashes	/	Consensus
There	is	still	a	chance	that	blocks	are	created	by	different	block-creators
at	the	same	time,	due	to	the	random	process	of	hashing.	If	a	bookkeeper
receives	two	valid	blocks	from	two	different	block-creators	(miners)	and
they	both	reference	the	hash	of	the	same	previous	block,	how	does	the
bookkeeper	know	which	one	to	use	and	which	one	to	throw	away?	How
does	the	network	come	to	
consensus
	about	which	block	to	use?	And	if	a
miner	receives	two	valid	but	competing	blocks,	how	do	they	know	which
block	to	build	the	next	block	on?
Solution:	Longest	Chain
	
Rule
There	is	another	protocol	rule	called	the	longest	chain	rule
97
.	If	a	miner
sees	two	valid	blocks	at	the	same	block	height	then	they	can	mine	on
either	block	(usually	the	first	seen)	and	would	keep	the	other	one	‘in
mind’.	Others	will	also	make	their	decisions	and	eventually	one	of	the
blocks	will	have	another	block	mined	on	it,	then	another,	and	another.	So
the	rule	is	that	the	
longest	chain
	is	the	chain	that	should	be	considered
the	chain	of	record,	and	the	block	that	is	discarded	is	called	an	
orphan
.
What	happens	to	the	transactions	in	the	orphaned	block?	They	are
considered	as	if	they	have	never	been	part	of	a	valid	block	and	therefore
are	‘unconfirmed’.	They	will	just	be	included	in	later	blocks	along	with
other	unconfirmed	transactions,	assuming	they	don’t	conflict	with	the
transactions	that	have	already	been	confirmed	in	the	blockchain.
Problem:	Double
	
Spend
Although	the	longest	chain	rule	seems	sensible,	it	can	be	used	to	create
mischief	in	a	deliberate	double	spend.	Here	is	how	you	could	do	it:
1.
Create	two	transactions	using	the	same	bitcoins:	one	payment	to	an
online	retailer,	the	other	to	yourself	(i.e.,	to	another	address	you
control).
2.
Only	broadcast	the	transaction	that	is	the	payment	to	the	retailer.
3.
When	the	payment	gets	added	in	an	‘honest’	block	the	retailer	sees
this	and	sends	you	goods.
4.
Secretly	create	a	longer	chain	of	blocks	which	excludes	the	payment
to	the	retailer,	and	replaces	it	with	the	payment	to	yourself.
5.
Publish	the	longer	chain.	If	the	other	nodes	are	playing	by	the
‘longest	chain	rule,’	then	they	will	reorganise	their	blockchains,
discarding	the	honest	block	containing	the	payment	to	the	retailer,
replacing	it	with	the	longer	chain	you	published.	The	honest	block	is
said	to	be	‘orphaned’	and,	to	all	intents	and	purposes,	does	not	exist.
6.
The	original	payment	to	the	retailer	will	be	deemed	invalid	by	the
honest	nodes	because	those	bitcoins	have	already	been	spent	in	your
longer,	substituted,	chain.	You	will	have	received	your	goods	but	the
payment	to	the	retailer	will	be	rejected	by	the	network.
How to double spend.
Solution:	Wait	About	Six
	
Blocks
Therefore,	common	advice	for	people	receiving	bitcoins	is	to	wait	for	the
transaction	to	be	a	few	blocks	deep	(i.e.,	to	have	a	few	blocks	mined	on
top	of	it).	This	gives	comfort	that	the	transaction	is	settled	and	can’t	easily
be	unwound
98
.	At	this	point	the	amount	of	mining	that	has	to	be	done	to
create	a	competing	chain	longer	than	the	existing	chain	is	enormous,
99
	so
rational	miners	would	prefer	to	dedicate	their	hash	power	towards
creating	legitimate	blocks,	receiving	the	block	reward	and	transaction
fees,	rather	than	trying	to	subvert	the	network.
To	put	it	another	way,	it	is	deliberately	hard	to	generate	a	valid	block.
Therefore,	if	someone	wants	to	replace	blocks,	they	have	to	create	blocks
quickly	and	overtake	the	rest	of	the	(presumably	honest)	network.	This	is
another	reason	why	people	say	Bitcoin’s	blockchain	is	immutable	and
cannot	be	changed.	However,	if	more	than	50%	of	the	total	hash	power	of
the	network	is	used	to	re-write	blocks,	then	it	will	be	able	to	do	so,
because	it	will	create	blocks	faster	than	the	other,	less	powerful,	half.	This
is	called	a	51%	attack.	Smaller	amounts	of	hash	power	can	also	be	used	to
re-write	the	blockchain,	but	with	a	lower	probability	of	success
100
.	51%
attacks	have	been	successfully	performed	on	unpopular	coins	with	few
miners.
Which
	
Coins?
Earlier,	I	used	the	phrase	‘
using	the	same	bitcoins
’.	What	does	this	mean?
With	physical	cash,	each	coin	or	banknote	is	a	unique	object.	You	can’t
pay	
the	same	coin	or	banknote
	to	two	people.	However,	digital	money
doesn’t	work	that	way.	In	a	traditional	bank	account,	all	your	money	is
mixed	up	or	
co-mingled
	in	a	‘total	balance’	figure.	Your	income	goes	into
the	bank	account	and	is	immediately	jumbled	up	with	all	the	other	money
that	is	in	there,	like	adding	water	to	a	half-full	bath.	When	you	make	a
payment	your	total	balance	is	reduced,	like	removing	water	from	the
bath.	You	cannot	specify	which	dollar	you	are	spending.	For	example,
when	you	pay	$8	for	a	coffee,	you	don’t	say,	‘Use	$8	from	my	salary
payment	that	came	in	on	25	Jan,’	you	just	say,	‘Use	$8	from	the	pool	of
money	that	is	my	account	balance’.	This	non-specificity	promotes	the
fungibility
	of	digital	money,	that	is,	one	dollar	in	an	account	is	exactly	the
same	as	another.
Bitcoin	is	digital,	but	it	works	more	like	physical	cash.	With	cash	you
open	your	wallet	and	take	
this	specific
	$10	note	which	you	received
earlier	and	pay	$8	for	your	coffee	and	expect	$2	change.	Bitcoin	is
similar:	for	every	payment	you	make,	you	have	to	specify	exactly	
which
coins	you	are	spending—that	is,	
which	specific
	bitcoins	that	you	received
earlier.	You	refer	to	these	received	bitcoins	by	the	transaction	hash
101
	that
sent	the	coins	to	you.	In	the	same	way	that	blocks	build	on	each	other	by
referring	to	the	previous	block’s	hash,	transactions	also	refer	to	each
other	using	a	previous	transaction’s	hash.	When	you	make	a	Bitcoin
payment,	you	say,	‘Take	
this
	bundle	of	money	that	came	in	to	my	account
in	
this
	transaction,	and	pay	some	of	it	to	
this
	account	and	return	the
change	to	me’.
Here	is	a	Bitcoin	transaction
102
.	You	can	see	that	it	takes	1.427	bitcoins
from	address	17tVxts…QM	and	sends	0.5999	bitcoins	into	1Ce2Qzz…wK
and	returns	0.827	bitcoins	back	to	17tVxts…QM.	But	wait…	The	two
payments	add	up	to	less	than	the	amount	spent.	0.5999	+	0.8270	=
1.4269	which	is	less	than	the	1.427	spent.	The	0.0001	Bitcoin	difference	is
the	mining	fee.	The	miner	can	add	that	0.0001	to	the	coinbase
transaction	in	the	block	and	pay	it	to	themselves.
If	we	look	at	the	block	the	transaction	is	included	in,
103
	we	can	see	that	the
miner	paid	themselves	12.52723951	bitcoins	in	the	coinbase	transaction,
which	is	the	12.5	BTC	block	reward	plus	the	sum	of	the	transaction	fees
from	the	transactions	in	the	block:
Hence	all	bitcoins	are	traceable.	You	can	see	the	exact	composition	of
every	lump	of	Bitcoin	that	comes	into	your	account—what	it	is	composed
of	and	where	it	came	from—and	you	can	trace	every	part	of	that	money
via	the	previous	accounts,	all	the	way	back	to	when	it	was	first	created	in
a	coinbase	transaction.
I	say	each	‘lump	of	money’	specifically,	rather	than	‘each	Bitcoin,’	because
you	don’t	send	bitcoins	coin	by	coin,	you	just	send	a	total	amount.	Let’s
see	how	this	works	with	an	example.
Let’s	start	with	an	empty	address	and	assume	that	you	are	friends	with	a
Bitcoin	miner	who	has	just	created	a	‘lump’	of	12.5	BTC	in	a	coinbase
transaction	when	they	successfully	mined	a	block.	The	12.5	BTC	is	like	a
single	banknote	in	a	physical	wallet	and	needs	to	be	spent	in	its	entirety.
The	miner	takes	pity	on	you	because	you	have	no	bitcoins	and	wants	to
give	you	1	BTC.	So	the	miner	creates	a	transaction	spending	those	12.5
BTC	to	two	recipients:	1	BTC	to	you,	and	11.5	BTC	back	to	herself.	You
now	have	a	1	BTC	‘lump’	in	your	account.
Now	it	is	your	lucky	day	and	a	few	other	people	give	you	BTC.	In	further
separate	transactions,	you	receive	‘lumps’	of	2	BTC	and	3	BTC.	So	now
separate	transactions,	you	receive	‘lumps’	of	2	BTC	and	3	BTC.	So	now
you	have	6	BTC	in	your	wallet,	in	three	lumps:	1	BTC,	2	BTC,	and	3	BTC.
If	you	want	to	give	1.5	BTC	to	another	friend,	how	would	you	do	that?	You
could	do	it	in	a	few	different	ways:
Option 1
: Spend the 2 BTC lump
You’d create a transaction that looks like this:
Spend: 2 BTC lump
Pay: 1.5 BTC to your friend, 0.5 BTC lump as change back to yourself
Option 2
: Spend the 3 BTC lump
You’d create a transaction that looks like this:
Spend: 3 BTC lump
Pay: 1.5 BTC to your friend, 1.5 BTC lump as change back to yourself
Option 3
: Spend the 1 BTC and 2 BTC lumps
You’d create a transaction that looks like this:
Spend: 1 BTC and 2 BTC lumps
Pay: 1.5 BTC to your friend, 1.5 BTC lump as change back to yourself
Option 4
: Spend the 1 BTC and 3 BTC lumps
You’d create a transaction that looks like this:
Spend: 1 BTC and 3 BTC lumps
Pay: 1.5 BTC to your friend, 2.5 BTC lump as change back to yourself
Option 5
: Spend the 1 BTC and 2 BTC and 3 BTC lumps
You’d create a transaction that looks like this:
Spend: 1 BTC and 2 BTC and 3 BTC lumps
Pay: 1.5 BTC to your friend, 4.5 BTC lump as change back to yourself
Although	Option	1	feels	like	the	most	obvious	and	is	probably	what	you
would	do	if	you	were	spending	banknotes	in	a	physical	wallet,	you	could
in	theory	choose	any	of	those	options.	These	are	all	different	transactions
but	all	achieve	the	same	thing.	The	lumps	of	money	that	sit	in	your
account	are	called	‘UTXO’s	which	stands	for	Unspent	Transaction
Outputs.	Most	people	think	in	terms	of	‘account	balances’	(i.e.,	my
account	goes	up	and	down)	whereas	Bitcoin	‘thinks’	in	transactions	(the
transaction	spends	
this
	money	and	puts	it	
there
).	The	lumps	are	the
result	or	
output
	of	a	transaction,	and	they	are	
unspent
	because	you
haven’t	spent	them	yet.	Bitcoin	would	describe	Option	1	as	follows:
Option	1:	Spend	the	2	BTC	lump
Transaction	
inputs
:	(this	is	money	that	is	being	spent)
1.
2	BTC	lump
Transaction	
outputs
:	(this	is	money	that	is	not	yet	spent)
1.
1.5	BTC	to	your	friend
2.
0.5	BTC	lump	as	change	back	to	yourself
This	whole	transaction	is	hashed,	giving	it	a	Transaction	ID	which	can
then	be	used	by	future	transactions.	If	you	later	want	to	spend	the	0.5
BTC	you	returned	to	yourself,	you	would	say	‘take	output	(2)	from	this
transaction,	and	spend	it	like	this…’
Now,	assuming	you	did	Option	1	described	above,	what	is	left	in	your
account?	You	started	with	lumps	of	1,	2,	and	3	BTC.	You	spent	the	2	BTC
lump	and	got	0.5	BTC	back.	So	you’re	left	with	three	lumps:	1	BTC,	3
BTC,	and	the	new	0.5	BTC	lump.	The	blockchain	records	that	the	0.5	BTC
lump	came	from	yourself,	so	anyone	can	trace	the	0.5	BTC	lump	back	to
its	original	2	BTC	lump,	and	then	further	trace	it	to	the	account	which	it
came	from	originally.
What
	
next?
The	transaction	is	created	and	signed	by	the	sender	using	their	private
keys.	This	signed	transaction	is	then	sent	to	a	node	(bookkeeper)	who
validates	it	according	to	business	rules	(e.g.,	Does	this	UTXO	exist?	Has	it
been	spent	before?)	and	technical	rules	(e.g.,	How	much	data	does	the
transaction	contain?	Is	the	digital	signature	valid?),	and	if	found	to	be
valid,	the	bookkeeper	keeps	this	transaction	in	a	pool	of	‘unconfirmed
transactions’	that	they	have	heard	about,	called	a	
mempool
	or	
memory
pool
.	They	then	propagate	this	transaction	to	their	neighbours	in	the
network.	Each	neighbour	follows	the	same	process.	Eventually	a	miner	or
block-creator	picks	up	this	transaction	and	decides	whether	they	want	to
pack	it	into	a	block,	and	if	so,	they	start	mining	the	block.	If	the	miner	is
successful	in	mining	the	block,	they	propagate	the	block	to	other	miners
and	bookkeepers	and	each	node	records	this	transaction	as	confirmed	in
a	block.
Peer-to-Peer
When	people	say	Bitcoin	is	‘peer-to-peer’	what	do	they	mean?
Firstly,	
data
	is	sent	between	bookkeepers	in	a	peer-to-peer	way,	i.e.,
directly	and	not	via	a	central	server.	Transactions	and	blocks	are	sent
between	bookkeepers	who	are	each	as	important	in	status	as	each	other—
that	is,	they	are	
peers
.	They	use	the	internet	to	send	data	between
themselves,	instead	of	a	3rd	party	infrastructure	like	the	SWIFT	network
used	by	major	banks.
Second,	Bitcoin	
payments
	are	often	described	as	peer-to-peer	(i.e.,	with
no	middle	man).	But	is	this	really	true?	Up	to	a	point.	A	
physical	cash
transaction	is	definitely	peer-to-peer	as	there	are	no	other	actors	other
than	the	payer	and	the	recipient.	But	Bitcoin	also	has	intermediaries	such
as	miners	and	bookkeepers.	The	difference	between	Bitcoin	payments
and	bank	payments	is	that,	with	Bitcoin	payments,	the	intermediaries	are
non-specific
	and	can	act	in	lieu	of	each	other,	whereas	traditional	banks
and	centralised	payment	services	are	
specific
	intermediaries.	For
example,	if	you	have	an	account	with	HSBC	you	can’t	instruct	another
bank	such	as	Citibank	to	move	your	money,	but	in	Bitcoin	any	miner	can
add	your	transaction	to	a	block	they	are	mining.
Peer-to-peer	models	of	data	distribution	are	like	a	gossip	network	where
each	peer	shares	updates.	Peer-to-peer	is	in	many	ways	less	efficient	than
client-server,	as	data	is	replicated	and	validated	many	times,	once	per
machine,	and	each	change	to	the	data	creates	a	lot	of	noisy	gossip.
However,	each	peer	is	independent	and	the	network	can	continue
operating	if	some	nodes	temporarily	lose	connectivity.	And	because	there
is	no	central	server	that	can	be	controlled,	peer-to-peer	networks	are
more	robust	and	resistant	to	shutdown,	whether	accidental	or	deliberate.
In	anonymous,	and	therefore	untrusted,	peer-to-peer	networks,	each	peer
needs	to	operate	on	the	basis	that	any	other	peer	could	be	a	bad	actor.	So
every	peer	needs	to	do	their	own	homework	and	validate	transactions	and
blocks,	rather	than	trusting	other	peers.	The	network	as	a	whole	acts
honestly,	if	populated	by	a	majority	of	honest	nodes.	Next,	we	examine
the	limits	of	bad	behaviour	and	the	related	costs	and	incentives.
Miscreants
What	can	and	can’t	miscreants	do?
The	impact	of	a	malicious	
bookkeeper
	is	very	limited.	They	can	withhold
transactions	and	refuse	to	pass	them	to	other	bookkeepers,	or	they	can
present	a	false	view	of	the	state	of	the	blockchain	to	anyone	asking	them.
A	quick	check	with	other	bookkeepers	will	reveal	any	discrepancies.
Malicious	
miners
	can	cause	a	little	more	impact.	They	can:
•
Attempt	to	create	blocks	that	include	or	exclude	specific	transactions
of	their	choosing.
•
Create	a	double	spend	by	attempting	to	create	a	‘longer	chain’	of
blocks	that	make	previously	accepted	blocks	become	‘orphans’	and
not	part	of	the	main	chain.	They	can	realistically	only	do	this	if	they
command	a	significant	proportion	of	the	entire	network’s	hashing
power.
But	they	can’t:
•
Steal	bitcoins	from	your	account,	because	they	can’t	fake	your	digital
signatures.
•
Create	bitcoins	out	of	thin	air,	because	no	other	miners	or
bookkeepers	would	accept	this	transaction.
So	the	impact	of	a	malicious	miner	is	also	actually	quite	limited.
Furthermore,	a	miner	discovered	to	be	enabling	double	spends	could
quickly	find	themselves	cut	off	from	the	rest	of	the	network	if	the	rest	of
the	network	informally	agrees	to	take	action.	Honest	miners	might	agree
not	to	build	on	blocks	generated	by	a	malicious	miner.
Summary
Transactions	are	payment	instructions	of	specific	amounts	of	Bitcoin
(UTXOs)	from	one	user-generated	account	(address)	to	another.	The
transactions	are	created	using	wallet	software,	authenticated	with	unique
digital	signatures,	then	sent	to	bookkeepers	(nodes)	who	individually
validate	them	according	to	some	well-known	business	and	technical
rules.	The	bookkeepers	then	add	valid	transactions	to	their	
mempool
	and
distribute	them	to	other	bookkeepers	that	they	are	connected	to.
Miners	gather	these	individual	transactions	into	blocks	and	compete	with
each	other	to	mine	their	blocks	by	tweaking	the	block	contents,
specifically	the	nonce	field,	until	the	hash	of	the	block	is	smaller	than
some	target	number.	The	target	number	is	based	on	the	difficulty	setting
at	the	time,	which	is	derived	from	the	time	taken	to	mine	the	previous	set
at	the	time,	which	is	derived	from	the	time	taken	to	mine	the	previous	set
of	blocks	to	achieve	a	network-wide	target	frequency	of	one	new	mined
block	every	10	minutes.	Miners	receive	a	financial	incentive	in	the	form	of
new	BTC	and	transaction	fees	which	they	may	credit	themselves,	to
compensate	for	spending	resources	to	perform	the	competitive,	repetitive
hashing	needed	to	create	valid	blocks.
The	blocks	link	to	each	other	in	a	unique	sequence	to	form	a	ledger,	the
Bitcoin	blockchain,	that	is	recorded	identically	almost	simultaneously	on
thousands	of	computers	around	the	world	that	run	Bitcoin	software.	If	a
Bitcoin	transaction	is	not	recorded	on	this	blockchain,	it	is	not	a	Bitcoin
transaction.	It	doesn’t	exist.	A	Bitcoin	transaction	recorded	outside	this
file	does	not	form	part	of	the	ledger.
There	is	no	central	authority	who	controls	the	ledger	or	who	can	censor
specific	transactions.
Different	blockchain	platforms	or	systems	work	differently.	If	you	relax	or
change	the	aims	or	constraints,	the	design	of	the	solution	can	also
change.	The	solution	may	be	simpler,	as	we	will	see	later	with	private
blockchains	where	censorship	resistance	is	not	a	critical	factor.
Bitcoin’s Ecosystem
Putting	this	all	together,	we	can	see	that	the	Bitcoin	ecosystem	consists	of
parties	who	perform	different	roles.	Miners	and	bookkeepers	focus	on
building	and	maintaining	the	blockchain	itself.	Wallets	make	it	easy	for
people	to	use	cryptocurrencies.	Exchanges	and	cryptocurrency	payment
processors	bridge	between	the	fiat	and	crypto	worlds.
Bitcoin in Practice
While	the	theory	sounds	good,	Bitcoin	in	practice	is	not	as	decentralised
as	people	might	have	you	believe.	By	some	metrics	it	is	not	performing	as
well	as	some	proponents	might	lead	you	to	believe.
Bookkeeping
	
Nodes
While	there	are	around	10,000	nodes	who	perform	bookkeeping	tasks
and	who	relay	transactions	and	blocks,	they	are	mostly	running	the	same
software	written,	and	therefore	controlled,	by	a	very	small	number	of
people.	They	are	known	as	the	‘Bitcoin	Core’	developers	and	the	software
is	known	as	‘Bitcoin	Core’.
Source: coin.dance
104
The	various	versions,	or	implementations,	that	are	not	Bitcoin	Core	all
have	slightly	different	rules	but	are	not	different	enough	to	create
incompatibilities.	Some,	for	example,	may	have	additional	flags	to	signal
that	the	bookkeepers	would	be	prepared	to	adopt	a	rule	change	if	enough
participants	also	signal	the	same	intention.
Mining
Although	anyone	can	mine,	the	process	has	become	so	intensive	that	new
hardware	and	chips	are	created	which	are	designed	to	be	exceedingly
efficient	at	performing	the	SHA-256	hashing.	ASICs	(Application	Specific
Integrated	Chips)	became	the	norm	for	mining	in	2014	and	outcompete
all	other	forms	of	hardware	in	terms	of	energy	efficiency	for	Bitcoin
mining.	Dave	Hudson	explores	the	effects	of	ASICs	in	his	excellent	blog
Hashing	It
105
.	In	the	popular	media,	the	computational	power	of	these
specially	designed	chips	is	often	compared	to	the	computational	power	of
supercomputers,	but	ACICs	cannot	operate	as	general-purpose
computers,	so	comparisons	with	supercomputers	are	meaningless.	Only	a
few	entities	can	mine	profitably,	usually	using	special	purpose	‘mining
farms’	clustered	in	areas	of	cheap	electricity.	The	chart	below	shows
miners	and	what	proportion	of	blocks	they	have	recently	mined.	The
proportion	of	blocks	they	have	mined	is	roughly	equivalent	to	their
hashing	power	as	a	proportion	of	the	total	hashing	power	of	the	network.
Bitcoin mining is not that decentralised! Source: blockchain.info
106
Some	of	these	are	single	mining	entities.	Others	are	syndicates	that
anyone	can	join,	contribute	hash	power,	and	receive	rewards	in
proportion	to	their	contributions.	At	an	estimate,	around	80%	of	the	hash
power	is	controlled	by	Chinese	entities.	BTC.com,	Antpool,	BTC.TOP,
F2Pool,	viaBTC	are	all	Chinese	groups
107
,	and	a	company	called	Bitmain
owns	both	BTC.com	and	Antpool.	Hence,	if	only	the	top	three	mining
pools	collaborate,	they	can	reorganise	blocks	and	arrange	double	spends,
and	no	one	would	be	able	to	stop	them	as	they	represent	more	than	50%
of	the	total	hashing	power.	So	this	is	not	a	well-decentralised	system.
It	is	often	argued	that	miners	wouldn’t	do	this	because	it	would	cause	a
loss	of	confidence	in	Bitcoin	and	thus	cause	the	price	to	fall,	and	their
stock	of	bitcoins	would	be	worth	less.	However,	an	enterprising	group	of
miners	who	carried	this	out	could	build	a	temporary	large	short	trading
position	just	before	executing	a	double	spend	and	profit	on	the	fall	in
price	of	BTC.
Mining
	
Hardware
As	discussed,	miners	use	special	purpose	chips	called	ASICS	that	are
specifically	designed	and	built	to	be	efficient	at	SHA256	hashing.
Commercial	chip	manufacturers	have	been	slow	to	design	chips	that	are
specifically	built	to	be	efficient	at	SHA256	hashing,	so	demand	has
created	an	alternative	specialised	industry	for	supplying	Bitcoin	ASICs.
The	main	provider	of	this	is	Bitmain,	the	same	Chinese	company	who
controls	the	top	two	mining	pools.	It	has	been	estimated	that	Bitmain
produces	hardware	that	mines	70-80%	of	the	total	blocks	in	Bitcoin
108
.
Bitcoin	hardware	manufacturing	is	not	well	decentralised.
BTC
	
ownership
The	ownership	of	BTC	too	shows	a	concentration	in	a	small	number	of
hands:
hands:
Source: bitinfocharts.com
109
According	to	this	analysis,	almost	90%	of	value	is	owned	by	fewer	than
0.7%	of	the	addresses.	Of	course,	we	have	to	treat	this	kind	of	analysis
with	some	caution.	Some	large	wallets	are	controlled	by	exchanges	who
take	custody	of	coins	on	behalf	of	a	large	number	of	users.	So	the	table
might	be	overstating	the	centralisation	of	Bitcoin	ownership.	Against
that,	some	people	might	spread	out	their	bitcoins	across	a	large	number
of	wallets	in	order	to	not	attract	attention.	This	is	very	easy	to	do.	So	the
table	might	be	understating	the	centralisation	of	Bitcoin	ownership.
However,	it	remains	highly	likely	that,	just	as	in	the	non-crypto	world,
very	few	people	probably	own	the	vast	proportion	of	the	value.	Now,
there’s	a	surprise.
Upgrades	to	the	Bitcoin
	
Protocol
Upgrades	to	the	Bitcoin	network	and	protocols	are	also	fairly	centralised.
Changes	are	suggested	in	‘Bitcoin	Improvement	Proposals’	(BIPs).	These
are	documents	that	anyone	may	write	but,	but	they	all	end	up	on	a	single
website:	
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips
.	If	it	gets	written	into	the
Bitcoin	Core	software	on	Github,	
https://github.com/bitcoin/Bitcoin
,	it
forms	part	of	an	upgrade,	the	next	version	of	‘Bitcoin	Core’	which	is	the
most	commonly	used	software,	or	‘reference	implementation,’	of	the
protocol.	As	we	have	seen,	this	is	run	by	the	vast	majority	of	participants.
Transaction
	
Fees
In	theory,	the	transaction	fees	collected	per	block	is	meant	to	compensate
for	the	decrease	in	block	reward	as	the	network	gets	more	popular	over
time.	The	reality	is	that	this	doesn’t	seem	to	be	working	out.
Source: tradeblock.com
110
The	chart	shows	that	except	for	a	brief	spike	at	the	end	of	2017,	the	total
transaction	fees	have	stayed	stubbornly	low	at	approximately	200	BTC
per	week.	Compare	this	with	the	new	12,600	BTC	generated	from
coinbase	rewards	per	week	(12.5	BTC	per	block	x	6	blocks/hour	x	24
hours/day	x	7	days/week	=	12,600	BTC,	a	figure	which	reduced	by	half	in
2016,	and	is	estimated	to	half	again	in	2020).	Without	significant
increase	in	transaction	fees	to	compensate,	clearly	the	economics	of
Bitcoin	mining	will	change.
Bitcoin’s Predecessors
Bitcoin,	like	most	innovative	innovations,	was	not	created	in	a	vacuum.
Bitcoin	was	built	by	drawing	from	previous	experiences	and	piecing
together	various	tried-and-tested	concepts	in	an	innovative	way	to	come
up	with	new	characteristics	for	decentralised	digital	cash.
Below	are	some	technologies	and	ideas	that	may	have	directly	or
indirectly	inspired	Bitcoin:
Digicash
It	is	hard	to	overstate	the	impact	that	David	Chaum	had	on	the
movement	towards	electronic	cash,	by	which	he	meant	a	privacy
preserving	digital	asset	that	could	settle	financial	obligations.	Chaum,	an
early	cypherpunk,	described	this	concept	in	1983	in	a	paper	entitled
‘
Blind	signatures	for	untraceable	payments
’	in	the	journal	
Advances	in
Cryptology	Proceedings
.	He	wanted	a	bank	to	be	able	to	create	digitally
signed	digital	lumps	of	cash	for	their	customers.	The	customers	could
spend	the	digital	cash	at	shops,	who	would	then	redeem	the	digital	cash
with	the	bank.	When	the	merchant	redeemed	the	digital	cash,	the	bank
would	see	that	the	digital	cash	was	good,	but	it	did	not	know	which	of	its
customers	the	digital	cash	had	originally	been	assigned	to.	The	individual
transactions	were	therefore	anonymous	as	far	as	the	bank	was	concerned.
Digicash	was	the	Amsterdam	based	company	incorporated	to
commercialise	this	technology.	The	system	was	called	eCash,	sometimes
Chaumian
	eCash,	with	the	tokens	themselves	called	CyberBucks.
Although	a	few	banks	did	some	trials	with	CyberBucks,	Digitcash	filed	for
bankruptcy	in	1998,	unable	to	secure	a	deal	to	keep	it	afloat.
b-money
In	November	1998,	Wei	Dai,	an	American-educated	cryptography
researcher	and	cypherpunk,	published	a	short	paper
111
	describing	b-
money	under	two	protocols.	b-money	would	operate	on	an	untraceable
network	where	senders	and	receivers	would	be	identified	only	by	digital
pseudonyms	(i.e.,	public	keys).	Every	message	would	be	signed	by	its
sender	and	encrypted	to	its	receiver.	Transactions	would	be	broadcast	to
a	network	of	servers	who	would	keep	track	of	account	balances	and
update	them	when	they	received	signed	transaction	messages.	Money
creation	would	be	agreed	by	the	participants	in	a	periodic	auction.
Hashcash
In	1992,	Cynthia	Dwork	and	Moni	Naor	described	a	technique	for
reducing	spam	(junk	email)	in	their	paper,
112
	‘
Pricing	via	Processing	or
Combatting	Junk	Mail
,’	by	creating	a	hoop	that	email	senders	would
have	to	jump	through	before	sending	emails.	Email	senders	would	have
to	attach	a	kind	of	
proof
	or	receipt	to	their	outbound	emails
demonstrating	that	they	had	incurred	a	very	small	‘cost’.	Recipients
would	reject	inbound	emails	without	these	receipts.	The	‘costs’	incurred
by	the	senders	would	be	tiny	at	normal	email	volumes,	but	add	up	and
discourage	spammers	who	send	out	millions	of	emails.	The	‘cost’	wasn’t	a
payment	to	a	third	party,	but	it	would	be	incurred	as	‘work’	in	the	form	of
repeated	calculations	that	had	to	be	made,	to	ensure	an	email	would	be
accepted.	So	the	receipt	would	be	a	‘proof’	that	repeated	calculations,	or
‘work’	had	been	done,	leading	to	the	phrase	‘proof-of-work’.
In	1997,	Adam	Back	proposed	a	similar	idea
113
	and	described	a	‘partial
hash	collision-based	postage	scheme’	which	he	named	‘Hashcash’.
Bitcoin	mining	uses	this	concept	of	forcing	someone	to	do	some	work,
and	proving	they	have	done	it,	before	allowing	them	access	to	a	resource.
He	followed	up	in	2002	with	a	paper,
114
	‘
Hashcash—A	Denial	of	Service
Counter-Measure
,’	describing	improvements	and	applications	of	proof-
of-work,	including	hashcash	as	a	minting	mechanism	for	Wei	Dai’s	b-
money	electronic	cash	proposal.
e-gold
E-gold	was	a	website	opened	in	1996	and	operated	by	Gold	&	Silver
Reserve	Inc.	(G&SR)	under	the	name	‘e-gold	Ltd’	that	allowed	customers
to	open	accounts	and	trade	units	of	gold	between	each	other.	The	digital
units	were	backed	by	gold	stored	in	a	bank	safe	deposit	box	in	Florida,
USA.	E-gold	didn’t	ask	users	to	prove	their	identity,	and	this	made	it
attractive	for	the	underworld.	It	became	very	successful.	It	was	reported
to	have	up	to	3.5	million	accounts	in	165	countries	in	2005	with	1,000
new	accounts	opening	every	day
115
,	but	the	website	was	eventually	shut
down	due	to	fraud	and	allegations	of	facilitation	of	crime
116
.	Unlike
Bitcoin,	it	had	a	centralised	ledger.
Liberty
	
Reserve
Like	e-gold,	Liberty	Reserve,	based	in	Costa	Rica,	allowed	customers	to
open	accounts	with	few	personal	details,	nothing	more	than	a	name,
email	address,	and	birth	date.	Liberty	Reserve	made	no	attempts	to	verify
these,	even	for	obviously	false	accounts	named	‘Mickey	Mouse’	and	so	on.
During	an	investigation
117
,	a	US	agent	opened	a	functional	account	with	a
username	‘ToStealEverything’	in	the	name	of	‘Joe	Bogus’	who	lived	at
‘123	Fake	Main	Street’	in	‘Completely	Made	Up	City,	New	York’	and	wrote
that	it	would	be	used	for	‘shady	things’.	As	a	result	of	its	relaxed	controls,
Liberty	Reserve	was	used	extensively	for	money	laundering	and	other
criminal	proceeds,	more	than	$6	billion	according	to	ABC	News
118
.	It
served	over	1	million	customers	before	it	was	shut	down	in	2013	by	the
US	Government	under	the	Patriot	Act.
Napster
Napster	was	a	peer-to-peer	filesharing	system	that	was	live	between	1999
and	2001.	It	was	created	by	Shawn	Fanning	and	Sean	Parker,	and	was
popular	with	people	who	liked	to	share	music,	particularly	in	mp3
format,	and	who	didn’t	like	to	pay	for	it.	The	idea	was	to	allow	anyone	to
copy	and	share	content	saved	on	users’	hard	drives.	At	its	peak	the	service
had	about	80	million	registered	users.	It	was	eventually	shut	down
because	its	relaxed	approach	to	the	sharing	of	copyright	material	wasn’t
appreciated	by	those	with	interests	vested	in	that	material.
Napster’s	technical	weakness	was	that	it	had	central	servers.	When	a	user
searched	for	a	song,	their	machine	would	send	the	search	request	to
Napster’s	central	servers,	which	would	return	a	list	of	computers	storing
that	song	and	would	allow	the	user	to	connect	to	one	of	them	(this	is	the
peer-to-peer	bit)	to	download	the	song.	Although	Napster	itself	didn’t
host	the	material,	it	made	it	easy	for	users	to	discover	others	who	did.
Centralised	services	and	entities	running	those	services	are	easy	to	shut
down,	and	so	it	was,	to	have	its	role	replaced	by	BitTorrent,	a
decentralised
	peer-to-peer	file	sharing	system.
Mojo
	
Nation
According	to	CEO	Jim	McCoy,	Mojo	Nation	was	an	open	source	project
that	was	a	cross	between	Napster	and	eBay.	Launched	in	or	around
2000
119
,	it	combined	filesharing	with	microtransactions	of	a	token	called
Mojo,	so	that	file	sharers	could	be	compensated	for	sharing	content.	It
split	files	into	encrypted	chunks	and	distributed	them	such	that	no	single
computer	would	host	an	entire	file.	Mojo	Nation	failed	to	gain	traction,
but	Zooko	Wilcox-O’Hearn,	who	worked	on	Mojo	Nation	later	founded
Zcash,	a	cryptocurrency	focused	on	transaction	privacy.
BitTorrent
BitTorrent	is	a	successful	peer-to-peer	filesharing	protocol	that	is	still	in
wide	use	today.	It	was	developed	by	BitTorrent	Inc,	a	company	cofounded
by	Bram	Cohen	who	worked	on	Mojo	Nation.	BitTorrent	is	popular	with
those	sharing	music	and	movies,	users	who	may	once	have	used	Napster.
It	is	decentralised:	each	search	request	is	made	from	user	to	user	rather
than	via	a	central	search	server.	As	there	is	no	central	point	of
administration,	it	is	hard	to	censor	and	shut	down.
As	a	theme,	whether	we	consider	money	(e-Gold,	Liberty	Reserve,	Bitcoin
etc),	or	data	(Napster,	BitTorrent,	etc),	the	evidence	shows	that
etc),	or	data	(Napster,	BitTorrent,	etc),	the	evidence	shows	that
decentralised	protocols	are	more	resilient	to	being	shut	down	than
services	with	a	central	point	of	control	or	failure.	I	expect	the	trend	of
decentralisation	to	continue	in	the	future,	driven	in	part	by	concerns	that
authorities	are	overextending	their	reach	into	private	social	matters.
Bitcoin’s Early Histor
y
Bitcoin’s	history	is	colourful,	more	colourful	than	some	received	wisdom
might	have	it.	Some	Bitcoin	proponents	say	‘Bitcoin	(the	protocol)	has
never	been	hacked,’	but	they	are	wrong.	Bitcoin	
has
	been	hacked.	Here	is
a	selection	of	events	from	historyofBitcoin.org

	and	the	Bitcoin	Wiki
121
with	my	personal	comments	about	these	events.

The	website	bitcoin.org	was	registered	using	anonymousspeech.com,	a
broker	that	registers	domains	on	behalf	of	customers	who	can	choose	to

or	group	involved	in	Bitcoin.

The	Bitcoin	whitepaper,	written	under	the	pseudonym	Satoshi
Nakamoto,	was	released	on	an	obscure	but	fascinating	mailing	list
metzdowd.com	that	is	much	loved	by	cypherpunks.	Wikipedia	has	this	to
say	about	cypherpunks:
A cypherpunk is any activist advocating widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-
enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change. Originally communicating
enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change. Originally communicating
through the cypherpunks electronic mailing list, informal groups aimed to achieve privacy
and security through proactive use of cryptography. Cypherpunks have been engaged in an
active movement since the late 1980s.
This	short	whitepaper	is	regarded	by	Bitcoin	believers	as	sort	of	bible.

The	genesis	(first)	block	was	mined.	At	that	moment,	the	first	bitcoins,
fifty	of	them,	were	created	out	of	thin	air	and	recorded	on	Bitcoin’s
blockchain	in	the	first	block—block	zero.	The	transaction	that	contains
the	mining	reward,	the	so	called	‘coinbase’	transaction,	contains	the	text:
‘The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks’
The	text	refers	to	a	headline	of	the	UK	newspaper	
The	Times
.	This	is
regarded	as	proof	that	the	block	cannot	have	been	mined	significantly
earlier	than	that	date,	and	the	headline	was	presumably	chosen
deliberately	for	its	implication:	When	banks	fail,	their	losses	are
socialized;	here	is	Bitcoin—it	doesn’t	need	banks.

So	beware	of	people	who	say	they	were	‘in	Bitcoin’	before	2009!	I	have
been	on	a	number	of	panels	where	other	panellists	try	to	establish
credibility	by	saying	just	how	early	they	were	involved	in	Bitcoin.
Sometimes,	in	their	enthusiasm,	they	try	to	convince	eager	listeners	that
they	were	there	before	2009…
An	interesting	aside:	The	50	BTC	mined	in	the	first	block	are
unspendable.	They	sit	in	address
1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa,	but	the	account	holder,
presumably	Satoshi,	whoever	he,	she,	or	they	may	be,	is	unable	to
transfer	them	to	anyone	else	due	to	some	quirk	in	the	code.

Version	0.1	of	the	Bitcoin	software	was	released	by	Satoshi	Nakamoto,
along	with	its	source	code.	This	allowed	people	to	review	the	code,	and
download	and	run	the	software,	becoming	both	bookkeepers	and	miners.
Bitcoin	was	thus	accessible	to	anyone	who	wanted	to	download	and	use
it.	Developers	were	able	to	scrutinise	the	code	and	build	on	it	if	they
wanted	to	contribute.

Previously,	people	traded	bitcoins,	but	in	a	relatively	unstructured	way	in
chat	rooms	and	message	boards.	An	exchange	is	the	first	step	towards
making	it	easier	for	people	to	buy	or	sell	bitcoins	and	increasing	price
transparency.

Pizza	day!	This	was	the	first	documented	time	bitcoins	were	used	to	pay
for	something	in	the	real	world.	Laszlo	Hanyecz,	a	programmer	in
Florida,	USA,	offered	to	pay	10,000	BTC	for	a	pizza	on	the	bitcointalk
forum
125

Another	developer	Jeremy	Sturdivant	(‘jercos’)	took	up	the	offer	and
called	Domino’s	Pizza	(not	Papa	Johns	as	frequently	reported)	and	had
two	pizzas	delivered	to	Laszlo.	He	received	10,000	BTC
126
	from	Laszlo.
Here	is	the	transaction
127
:
Laszlo	kept	the	offer	open	and,	over	the	next	month,	received	a	number	of
pizzas	for	10,000	BTC	each	time,	before	cancelling	the	offer:
This	is	the	first	transaction	where	bitcoins	were	used	for	economic
activity	other	than	a	straight	buy	or	sell.

Jed	McCaleb	(who	has	more	recently	founded	Stellar,	a	cryptocurrency
platform	based	on	Ripple),	converted	his	card	trading	exchange	into	a
Bitcoin	trading	exchange.	‘Mt	Gox,’	usually	pronounced	‘mount	gox,’
stands	for	‘Magic:	The	Gathering	Online	eXchange’.	
Magic:	The
Gathering
	is	a	collectable	card	game,	and	the	website	was	used	initially	to
trade	cards	before	it	was	converted	to	a	Bitcoin	exchange.	Initially,	you
could	fund	your	Mt	Gox	account	using	PayPal,	but	in	October,	they
switched	to	Liberty	Reserve.	Mt	Gox	would	eventually	collapse	in	Nov
2013–Feb	2014,	but	in	its	heyday,	it	was	the	largest	and	most	well-known
and	well-used	exchange.

Bitcoin’s	protocol	got	hacked.	Beware	the	popular	narrative	that	says,
‘Bitcoin	itself	has	never	been	hacked’.	A	potential	vulnerability	was
discovered,	and	someone	exploited	this	vulnerability	in	block	74,638	to
create	184	billion	bitcoins	for	themselves.	This	strange	transaction	was
quickly	discovered	and,	with	the	consent	of	the	majority	of	the
community,	the	whole	blockchain	was	‘forked,’	reverting	it	to	a	previous
state	(we	will	discuss	forks	later).
So	much	for	the	immutability	of	Bitcoin’s	blockchain:	there	are	always
exceptions.
The	bug	was	fixed.	Bruno	Skvorc	has	written	a	good	explanation	of	how	it
happened	on	his	blog

,	and	the	bitcointalk	forum	has	a
thread

an	organisation	where	multiple	participants	combine	their	hash	power	to

the	rewards	between	them	in	proportion	to	their	hash	power

WIRED
	magazine	published	a	famous	article,	‘Underground	website	lets
you	buy	any	drug	imaginable,’
130
	written	by	Adrian	Chen.	It	described	a
website	called	The	Silk	Road,	launched	in	Feb	2011	and	run	by	twenty-
seven-year	old	Ross	William	Ulbricht	under	the	nickname	‘Dread	Pirate
Roberts,’
131
.	The	Silk	Road	was	described	as	a	kind	of	‘eBay	for	drugs’—a
darknet	market,	only	accessible	through	the	special	browser	Tor
132
,	which
matched	buyers	and	sellers	of	drugs	and	other	illegal	or	questionable
paraphernalia.	Bitcoins	were	used	as	the	payment	mechanism.
Source: stopad.io
133
.
Here	is	how	the	article	describes	Bitcoin:
As for transactions, Silk Road doesn’t accept credit cards, PayPal or any other form of
payment that can be traced or blocked. The only money good here is Bitcoins.
Bitcoins have been called a ‘cryptocurrency,’ the online equivalent of a brown paper bag of
cash. Bitcoins are a peer-to-peer currency, not issued by banks or governments, but created
and regulated by a network of other Bitcoin holders’ computers. (The name ‘Bitcoin’ is
derived from the pioneering file sharing technology BitTorrent.) They are purportedly
untraceable and have been championed by cyberpunks, libertarians and anarchists who
dream of a distributed digital economy outside the law, one where money flows across
borders as free as bits.
To purchase something on Silk Road, you need first to buy some bitcoins using a service like
Mt. Gox Bitcoin Exchange. Then, create an account on Silk Road, deposit some bitcoins, and
start buying drugs. One Bitcoin is worth about $8.67, though the exchange rate fluctuates
wildly every day.
This	was	the	first	time	Bitcoin	came	to	the	attention	of	a	wide	audience.
The	Silk	Road	was	eventually	taken	down	by	US	authorities	in	October
2013,	though	many	copycats	have	taken	its	place.

Wikileaks	and	other	organisations	began	to	accept	bitcoins	for	donations.
Bitcoin	is	attractive	for	these	organisations	owing	to	its	censorship
resistance.	While	is	it	relatively	easy	for	a	government	to	lean	on
traditional	payment	systems	(banks,	PayPal,	etc)	to	monitor	transactions,
block	assets	and	freeze	accounts,	cryptocurrencies	provide	an	alternative
funding	mechanism.	Whether	this	is	good	or	bad,	of	course,	is	a	matter	of
opinion…

Mike	Caldwell	started	creating	physical	bitcoins	which	he	called	Casacius
coins.	They	are	physical	discs	of	metal,	each	with	a	unique	private	key
embedded	behind	a	hologram	sticker.	Each	coin’s	private	key	is	linked	to
an	address	that	is	funded	with	a	specified	amount	of	bitcoins,	as	depicted
on	the	coin.

These	Casascius	coins	are	the	physical	representations	used	in	many
stock	photos	used	for	media	articles	about	bitcoins.	They	are	also	prized
as	collector’s	items	and	cost	much	more	than	the	value	of	the	bitcoins
contained	in	them,	especially	the	first	edition,	which	had	a	spelling
mistake.

Satoshi	Dice	was	a	gambling	website	launched	on	24	April	2012.	Users
could	send	bitcoins	to	specific	addresses	with	a	chance	of	winning	up	to
64,000	times	their	original	stake.	Each	address	had	a	different	payout
and	a	different	chance	of	winning.	On	8	May,	it	became	responsible	for
over	half	the	transaction	volume	on	the	Bitcoin	blockchain.	Satoshi	Dice
was	created	by	libertarian	Eric	Voorhees	and	was	extremely	popular.
Early	adopters	seemed	to	have	a	penchant	for	gambling,	and	there	wasn’t
much	else	they	could	do	with	their	bitcoins.
It	was	an	interesting	gambling	system.	Unlike	other	online	casinos	where
users	have	to	trust	that	the	house	is	not	cheating,	Satoshi	Dice	was
provably	fair
,	using	deterministic	cryptographic	hashes	as	the	random
number	generators.	Of	course,	the	house	had	an	edge,	but	the	edge	was
small,	known	(1.9%),	and	was	demonstrably	adhered	to.
This	development	started	the	debate	about	what	‘spamming’	a	network
with	transactions	means	when	there	are	no	terms	of	service.	It	also
started	the	community	thinking	about	what	fair	transaction	fees	should
be.

one.
Bitcoin’s	categorisation	has	tax	and	other	implications	that	differ	by
jurisdiction.	The	classification	of	bitcoins	and	cryptocurrencies	may	mean
the	difference	between	zero	or	punitive	tax	rates	in	any	given	tax	regime,
and	therefore	may	have	an	impact	on	its	potential	adoption	and	usage

Bitcoin’s	price	became	searchable	through	Bloomberg	software,	which	is

ticker	‘XBT’	to	represent	Bitcoin,	consistent	with	ISO	currency	code
standards.	With	ISO	currency	codes	(e.g.,	USD,	GBP,	etc),	the	first	two
letters	denote	the	country	and	the	third	letter	denotes	the	currency	unit.
The	symbol	‘BTC,’	if	adopted,	would	indicate	a	currency	of	Bhutan

Precious	metals	such	as	gold	(XAU),	silver	(XAG),	palladium	(XPD),	and
platinum	(XPT)	are	also	considered	a	‘currency’	but	start	with	X	as	they
are	not	associated	with	a	country.	Bitcoin	follows	the	currency	standard

Bitcoins	were	ruled	as	private	money	in	Germany
138

if	held	for	more	than	a	year.	The	tax	treatment	of	bitcoins	and
cryptocurrencies	is	a	major	point	of	contention,	especially	in	the	USA
where	the	buying	and	selling	of	bitcoins	attracts	capital	gains.	If	you
bought	a	Bitcoin	at	$100,	then,	after	its	price	had	risen	to	say	$1,000,	you
exchanged	it	for	Ether,	another	cryptocurrency,	then	you	would	have	to
record	that	as	a	capital	gain	of	$900	and	pay	tax	on	that	capital	gain,	even
though	your	assets	were	still	in	cryptocurrency	and	you	hadn’t	realised
that	gain	in	USD.	So,	depending	on	jurisdiction,	tax	authorities	may	well
consider	the	exchange	of	cryptocurrencies	as	selling	and	buying	with	fiat
currency	and	want	to	see	those	transactions	taxed.

After	a	long	saga	of	hacks,	glitches,	poor	management	practices,	lost
coins,	suspended	withdrawals,	failed	banking	transactions,	and	other
incompetence,	Mt	Gox	finally	filed	for	bankruptcy	protection	in	Japan	in
Feb	2014.	The	company	said	it	had	lost	almost	750,000	of	its	customers’
bitcoins	and	around	100,000	of	its	own	bitcoins,	together	worth	around
$473	million	near	the	time	of	the	filing.	There	are	numerous	theories	as
to	what	happened,	the	most	compelling	being	a	combination	of	hackers
draining	the	Mt	Gox	hot	wallets	and	management	incompetence.	The
whole	escapade,	including	the	bankruptcy	proceedings,	was	in	such
shambles	and	even	the	full	creditor	list	(containing	full	names	and
amounts	claimed)	was	leaked.	The	story	of	Mt	Gox	deserves	its	own	book,
but	for	a	summary	it	is	worth	reading	the	Wikipedia	entry
139
	about	this
sorry	story.
After	Mt	Gox’s	implosion,	Bitfinex	became	the	world’s	largest	exchange
for	a	while.
Creditors	to	the	bankrupt	estate	have	not	yet	been	compensated,	and	if
they	ever	will	be,	it	will	be	in	Japanese	yen	at	a	rate	that	roughly	equates
to	$400	per	Bitcoin—less	than	a	tenth	of	Bitcoin’s	value	at	time	of
writing.
Bitcoin’s Price
Like	gold	or	oil	or	any	other	asset,	bitcoins	have	a	value	that	can	be	priced
in	USD	or	any	other	currency.	This	means	there	are	people	who	are
willing	to	exchange	BTC	with	USD,	usually	using	cryptocurrency
exchanges,	marketplaces	which	attract	buyers	and	sellers.	On	exchanges
you	can	see	indications	of	supply	and	demand	for	cryptocurrencies	at	any
price	level	(more	on	these	later).	You	can	also	buy	and	sell	bitcoins	with
anyone	in	the	world,	physically	on	the	streets	or	over	the	internet,	or
using	brokers	who	mediate	between	buyers	and	sellers,	or	who	trade	on
their	own	behalf.	To	trade	BTC,	you	simply	need	the	ability	to	send	or
receive	BTC	and	the	ability	to	receive	or	send	the	other	asset,	usually	a
local	currency.
Like	any	other	market-traded	asset,	the	price	of	Bitcoin	fluctuates	with
supply	and	demand.	At	any	point	in	time,	people	trade	at	prices	that	they
are	comfortable	buying	or	selling	at.	If	there	is	more	buying	pressure	and
people	want	to	buy	more	bitcoins,	prices	will	increase.	If	there	is	selling
pressure	and	people	want	to	sell	more	bitcoins	for	fiat	currencies,	then
the	price	at	which	the	bitcoins	change	hands	will	drop.	Later	we	will	go
into	more	detail	about	how	cryptocurrencies	and	tokens	can	be	priced,
but	here	we	will	look	at	specifically	Bitcoin’s	price.
Bitcoin’s	Price
	
History
Bitcoin’s	price	has	been	a	wild	ride.	A	recent	price	rise	to	almost	$20,000
USD	per	Bitcoin	and	subsequent	fall	the	$6,000	levels	has	caught	the
media’s	attention:
2018: $20,000 per Bitcoin and a 60% crash? That is nuts!
But	this	is	not	the	first	time	Bitcoin	has	been	this	volatile.	Bitcoin	appears
to	be	cyclically	volatile,	with	each	cycle	as	dizzy	as	the	previous.
Here	is	the	2013/14	bubble	in	detail:
2013/14: $1,200 per Bitcoin and an 80% crash? That is also nuts!
The	peak	price	on	Mt	Gox	was	almost	$1,200	per	Bitcoin,	and	then
crashed	to	below	$200,	rebounded	and	then	traded	lower	and	lower	over
crashed	to	below	$200,	rebounded	and	then	traded	lower	and	lower	over
to	the	$200-300	range	during	the	‘Bitcoin	winter’	of	2014.	These	were
painful	times	for	holders	of	Bitcoin,	if	good	times	for	far-sighted	buyers.
There	are	different	theories	for	the	cause	of	this	bubble	including	the
activities	of	trading	bots—programs	that	automatically	buy	and	sell—and
the	fact	that	you	couldn’t	withdraw	fiat	from	Mt	Gox.	Anyone	wanting	to
withdraw	value	from	Mt	Gox	had	to	buy	bitcoins	(pushing	the	price	up)
and	withdraw	bitcoins.	The	Chinese	government	then	announced	that
they	were	going	to	ban	Bitcoin	trading	and	the	price	crashed.
But	this	was	by	no	means	the	first	bubble.	Here	is	early	2013,	close	up,
when	in	April	the	price	rose	from	$15	to	a	peak	of	$266	before	crashing	to
around	$50:
Early 2013: $266 per Bitcoin and an 80% crash? That is nuts again!
A	common	theory	about	this	was	that	people	in	Cyprus	were	buying
bitcoins.	At	the	time,	there	was	financial	chaos	in	Cyprus.	Some	bank
accounts	were	frozen,	some	ATMs	were	empty,	and	one-off	taxes	were
applied	to	large	bank	account	balances.	Another	theory	was	that	some
large	institutional	funds	were	buying	bitcoins	to	build	a	position,	buying
up	available	supply.	I	am	not	sure	how	likely	these	theories	are	to	have
up	available	supply.	I	am	not	sure	how	likely	these	theories	are	to	have
directly	affected	prices,	but	all	it	takes	to	move	markets	is	for	people	to
believe	stories.
This	bubble	may	seem	quaint	as	the	numbers	are	smaller	than	the	range
we	are	used	to	today,	but	an	80%	drop	is	an	80%	drop,	as	stressful	then
as	it	would	be	today.
Further	back	in	time,	we	have	the	June	2011	bubble:
2011: $31 per Bitcoin and an 80% crash? That is more nuts!

helped	to	generate	interest	in	Bitcoin,	pushing	the	price	from	about	$3	to
a	high	of	about	$31.	Over	the	next	6	months	the	price	slowly	fell	to	below
$5,	more	than	80%	down.
And	here	is	the	first	bubble	in	July	2010:
2010: $0.09 per Bitcoin and a 40% crash? Even that is nuts!
An	article	about	a	new	version	of	the	Bitcoin	software	was	published	in	a
popular	technical	magazine	
Slashdot

	and	interest	was	generated,
pushing	the	price	on	the	Bitcoin	Market	up	from	less	than	1	cent	per
Bitcoin	to	almost	10	cents.	The	price	then	fell	40%	and	traded	sideways	at
about	6	cents	per	Bitcoin	for	a	few	months	before	increasing	again.
Storing Bitcoins
You	may	hear	that	
bitcoins
	are	stored	in	wallets.	If	this	were	true,	then	if
you	copied	your	wallet	you’d	own	double	the	number	of	bitcoins.	Clearly
you	couldn’t	have	digital	money	that	works	this	way.	So	no,	bitcoins	are
not	stored	in	wallets.
So	where	are	bitcoins	stored?	Well,	
ownership
	of	bitcoins	is	recorded	on
Bitcoin’s	blockchain,	which	is,	as	we	have	seen,	the	database	replicated
on	over	10,000	computers	around	the	world	containing	every	Bitcoin
transaction	ever.	So	you	can	look	at	that	database	and	see	that	at	this
time,	a	specific	address	has	a	specific	number	of	bitcoins	associated	with
it.	For	example,	the	blockchain	would	store	the	fact	that	the	address
1Jco97X5FbCkev7ksVDpRtjNNi4zX6Wy4r	had	had	0.5	BTC	sent	to	it,
and	that	those	0.5	BTC	have	not	yet	been	sent	elsewhere.	Bitcoin’s
blockchain	doesn’t	store	
balances
	of	accounts	(it	is	not	a	list	of	account
numbers	and	corresponding	BTC	balances),	it	stores	
transactions
.	So	to
get	the	current	balance	of	any	account,	you	need	to	look	at	all	the
inbound	and	outbound	transactions	through	that	account.
Bitcoin	wallets	store	
private	keys
	(not	bitcoins!)	and	their	software
makes	it	easy	for	the	user	of	the	wallet	to	see	how	many	coins	they	control
and	to	make	payments.	If	you	cloned	your	wallet,	you	would	be	cloning
your	private	keys,	not	doubling	your	bitcoins.
Software Wallets
Bitcoin	wallets	are	apps	that	can	at	least:
•
Create	new	Bitcoin	addresses	and	store	the	corresponding	private
keys
•
Display	your	addresses	to	someone	who	wants	to	send	you	a
payment
•
Display	how	many	bitcoins	are	in	your	addresses
•
Make	Bitcoin	payments
Let’s	explore	each	of	these	capabilities.
Address
	
Creation
Creating	new	Bitcoin	addresses	is	an	offline	operation	and	involves
creating	a	public	and	private	key	pair.	You	can	do	this,	if	you	like,	using
dice
141
.	This	is	different	from	any	other	account	creation	process	where
you	have	to	ask	a	third	party	to	create	an	account	for	you,	for	example
asking	your	bank	or	Facebook	to	assign	you	an	account.
•
Step	1:	Generate	some	randomness	and	use	it	to	pick	a	number	from
1	to	2256-1.	This	is	your	private	key.
•
Step	2:	Do	some	maths	on	it	to	generate	a	public	key.
•
Step	3:	Hash	your	public	key	twice	to	create	your	Bitcoin	address.
•
Step	4:	Save	the	private	key	and	its	corresponding	address.
142
So	you	assign	yourself	an	address	without	asking	or	checking	with	anyone
to	see	if	it	already	taken.	This	sounds	scary.	What	if	someone	else	has
already	chosen	your	private	key?	The	short	answer	is	that	this	is
extremely	unlikely.	2256	is	a	big	number,	78	digits	long,	and	you	can	pick
any	number	up	to	that.	Your	chance	of	winning	the	UK	lottery	is	1	in
13,983,816—which	only	has	eight	digits.	A	number	with	seventy-eight
digits	is	astronomically	large.	In	theory	someone	could	deliberately
generate	millions	or	billions	of	accounts	per	second	and	check	them	for
coins	to	steal,	but	the	number	of	valid	accounts	is	so	humongous	that
they’d	be	doing	it	forever	before	finding	a	single	account	that	has	been
used	before.	In	practice,	however,	weaknesses	can	exist,	and	they	rely	on
exploiting	flaws	in	the	random	number	generation	for	the	private	keys.	If
there	is	a	flaw	in	the	randomness	when	generating	your	private	key,	this
flaw	could	be	exploited	to	reduce	the	search	space	for	a	thief
143
.
Address
	
Display
When	someone	wants	to	send	you	bitcoins,	you	need	to	tell	them	your
address—like	telling	someone	your	bank	account	number	so	they	can
send	you	money.	There	are	a	few	ways	to	do	this.	One	popular	way	is	by
showing	it	as	a	QR	code.
Example	Bitcoin	address:	1LfSBaySpe6UBw4NoH9VLSGmnPvujmhFXV
Equivalent	QR	code:
QR	codes	are	not	magic.	They	are	just	text,	encoded	in	a	visual	way	that
makes	it	easy	for	QR	code	scanners	to	read	the	code	and	convert	it	back
into	text.
Another	way	is	just	to	copy	and	paste	the	address	itself:
Account
	
Balance
The	wallet	needs	to	access	an	up	to	date	version	of	the	blockchain	in
order	to	be	aware	of	all	the	transactions	going	in	and	out	of	the	addresses
it	is	keeping	tabs	on.	The	wallet,	software	can	do	this	by	either	storing	the
entire	blockchain	and	keeping	it	up	to	date	(this	is	called	a	full	node
wallet)	or	by	connecting	to	a	node	elsewhere	which	does	the	heavy	lifting
(this	is	called	a	lightweight	wallet).
A	full	node	wallet	would	contain	over	a	hundred	gigabytes	of	data	and
would	need	to	be	constantly	connected	over	the	internet	to	other	Bitcoin
nodes.	So	in	many	cases,	especially	on	mobile	phones,	this	is	not	practical
so	the	wallet	software	is	lightweight	and	connects	to	a	server	which	hosts
the	blockchain.	The	wallet	software	on	the	phone	asks	the	server	‘What’s
the	balance	of	address	x?’	and	‘Please	give	me	all	the	transactions	related
to	address	y’.
Bitcoin
	
Payments
As	well	as	reading	the	account	balances,	the	wallet	needs	to	be	able	to
make	payments.	To	make	a	Bitcoin	payment,	the	wallet	generates	a
bundle	of	data	called	a	‘transaction,’	which	includes	references	to	the
coins	that	are	going	to	be	spent	(transaction	inputs	consisting	of	unspent
outputs	of	previous	transactions),	and	which	accounts	the	coins	will	be
sent	to	(new	outputs).	We	saw	this	in	an	earlier	section.	This	transaction
is	then	digitally	signed	using	the	relevant	private	keys	of	the	addresses
holding	the	coins.	Once	signed,	the	transaction	is	sent	to	neighbouring
nodes,	via	its	server	node	if	it	is	a	lightweight	wallet,	or	directly	to	other
peers	if	it	is	a	full	node	wallet.	The	transactions	eventually	find	their	way
to	miners	who	add	them	to	blocks.
Other
	
Features
Good	wallet	software	has	more	functionality,	including	the	ability	to	back
up	private	keys	(encrypted	with	a	passphrase)	either	to	a	user’s	hard	drive
or	to	a	cloud	storage	server	somewhere,	to	generate	one-time	use
addresses	for	privacy,	to	hold	addresses	and	private	keys	for	multiple
cryptocurrencies.	Some	are	even	integrated	with	exchanges	to	allow	users
cryptocurrencies.	Some	are	even	integrated	with	exchanges	to	allow	users
to	convert	between	one	cryptocurrency	and	another	directly	from	within
the	wallet	software.
Often	wallets	will	allow	you	to	split	keys	or	set	up	addresses	that	require
multiple	digital	signatures	to	spend	from.
You	can	split	a	private	key	into	several	parts	so	that	a	certain	threshold
number	of	parts	are	needed	to	create	the	original	private	key.	This	is	a
process	known	as	‘sharding’	or	‘splitting’	a	private	key	and	a	common
example	is	2-of-3	sharding	where	a	private	key	is	split	into	3	parts,	any	2
of	which	can	be	combined	to	regenerate	the	original	key.	Similarly	you
can	have	2-of-4	or	3-of-4	or	any	combination	of	parts	and	total	shards,
generically	
m-of-n
.	One	algorithm	to	do	this	is	using	Shamir’s	secret
sharing
144
.	This	lets	you	split	a	key	and	store	parts	of	it	separately	in
different	places,	but	with	some	resiliency	in	that,	if	you	lose	one	or	more
pieces,	it	may	not	be	catastrophic.
You	can	also	create	addresses	that	require	multiple	digital	signatures	to
make	payments	from	them.	These	are	known	as	‘multi-sig’	addresses
145
.
Again,	you	can	have	1-of-3,	2-of-3,	3-of-3,	or	generically	m-of-n.	This	has
a	similar	effect	as	sharding	a	single	private	key,	but	with	slightly	better
security	properties.	This	lets	you	create	a	transaction,	sign	it,	send	it	over
the	internet	in	the	clear,	and	let	someone	else	sign	it	before	it	is
considered	a	valid	transaction	(key	splitting	on	the	other	hand	only
results	in	one	signature).	These	addresses	let	you	create	systems	where
multiple	people	need	to	sign	or	approve	a	transaction,	like	some
corporate	cheques	that	need	two	signatures.
Software	Wallet
	
Examples
Examples	of	popular	Bitcoin	software	wallets:
•
Blockchain.info
•
Electrum
•
Jaxx
•
Breadwallet
Note	that	I	do	not	endorse	these,	and	others	are	available.	They	could
have	bugs,	and	you	must	do	your	own	research	before	picking	a	wallet	to
use.	Most	wallet	software	is	open	source,	so	you	can	investigate	the	code
and	see	that	there	are	no	backdoors	or	vulnerabilities	in	the	code,	before
you	use	them.
Hardware Wallets
Sometimes	Bitcoin	wallets	can	have	a	hardware	component.	Private	keys
are	stored	in	chips	on	small	handheld	devices.	Two	popular	hardware
wallets	are	called	‘Trezor’	and	‘Ledger	Nano,’	but	there	are	others.
A Trezor
A Ledger Nano
These	devices	are	specifically	designed	to	store	private	keys	securely	and
only	respond	to	certain	pre-programmed	requests,	for	example,	‘Please
sign	this	transaction,’	and	not,	‘Show	me	the	private	key	you	are	storing’.
Because	the	private	key	is	stored	on	hardware	that	is	not	connected	to	the
internet	and	can	communicate	with	the	outside	world	only	via	a	limited
set	of	pre-programmed	interfaces,	it	is	much	harder	for	a	hacker	to	gain
access	to	the	private	keys.
The	user	interface	software	is	run	on	an	online	machine.	When	it	comes
to	the	critical	part	of	the	transaction	(the	signing),	the	unsigned
transaction	is	sent	to	the	hardware	wallet,	which	returns	the	signed
transaction	without	revealing	the	private	key.
Hardware	wallets	are	more	secure	than	software-only	wallets,	but
nothing	is	infallible.
Cold
	
Storage
The	phrase	‘keeping	coins	in	cold	storage’	was	popular	in	2013-17	before
hardware	wallets	became	widely	available.	Remember,	you	don’t	store
bitcoins,	you	store	private	keys.	‘Cold	storage’	is	keeping	a	note	of	those
private	keys	on	offline	media,	such	as	a	piece	of	paper	or	a	computer	not
private	keys	on	offline	media,	such	as	a	piece	of	paper	or	a	computer	not
connected	to	the	internet.	As	private	keys	are	just	strings	of	characters
like:
There	are	many	ways	of	storing	them.	You	can	memorise	keys	if	you	have
a	good	memory,	you	can	print	them	out	on	bits	of	paper,	you	can	even
engrave	them	on	a	ring	that	you	wear,	like	Charlie	Shrem	did	according	to
WIRED
	
Magazine
146
.	You	could	store	them	on	an	offline	computer	which,
for	increased	security,	should	not	have	a	modem	or	network	card.	You
could	write	them	down	and	put	them	in	a	bank’s	locked	deposit	box.
These	are	all	methods	of	storing	your	private	keys	offline.
If	you	do	keep	private	keys	on	a	device	or	printed	out,	you	wouldn’t	want
someone	else	to	be	able	to	see	it	and	use	it	to	steal	your	bitcoins.	So	one
way	of	increasing	security	is	to	first	encrypt	the	private	key	with	a
passphrase	that	you	can	remember	and	then	store	or	print	out	the
encrypted	result.	Passphrases	are	a	lot	easier	to	remember	than	private
keys!	This	means	that	even	if	someone	gets	hold	of	the	device	or	print
out,	they’d	need	to	decrypt	it	with	your	passphrase	before	the	private	key
is	revealed.	You	can	split	keys	or	use	multi-sig	addresses	for	further
security.	This	means	if	one	part	is	found	by	a	thief,	it	is	useless	without
another	part,	and	also	means	if	one	part	is	lost,	the	other	two	will	still
work.	Remember,	you	are	trying	to	simultaneously	guard	against	two
things:	Loss	of	keys	and	theft	of	keys.
Hot
	
Wallets
A	hot	wallet	is	a	wallet	that	can	sign	and	broadcast	transactions	without
manual	intervention.	Exchanges,	who	control	many	bitcoins	need	to
manual	intervention.	Exchanges,	who	control	many	bitcoins	need	to
manage	lots	of	Bitcoin	payments,	as	we	will	see	later.	They	often	have	a
‘hot	wallet’	that	controls	a	small	proportion	of	their	total	bitcoins.
Customers	of	exchanges	like	to	withdraw	bitcoins	from	the	exchanges	by
clicking	a	button,	causing	an	automated	process	to	run	to	make	and	sign
a	Bitcoin	transaction	moving	bitcoins	from	the	exchange’s	hot	wallet	to
the	user’s	personal	wallet.	This	means	that	somewhere,	a	private	key
belonging	to	the	exchange	must	be	stored	on	a	‘hot’	machine	connected	to
the	internet.	There	is	a	trade-off	between	security	and	convenience.
Online	machines	are	easier	to	hack	than	offline	machines,	but	can
automate	the	process	of	creating	and	broadcasting	Bitcoin	transactions.
Due	to	this	trade-off,	exchanges	keep	only	a	small	fraction	of	BTC	in	hot
wallets,	enough	to	satisfy	customer	demand,	similar	to	banks	that	keep	a
small	amount	of	cash	in	tellers’	tills	at	branches.
Buying and Selling Bitcoins
You	can	buy	bitcoins	from	anyone	who	has	them.	Likewise	you	can	sell
bitcoins	to	anyone	who	wants	them.	Fortunately,	there	are	various	places
where	you	are	likely	to	find	a	group	of	people	willing	to	trade	at
competitive	prices—exchanges.
Exchanges
Just	like	stock	exchanges,	Bitcoin	or	cryptocurrency	exchanges	are	places
(usually	websites)	that	attract	traders.	However,	you	don’t	buy	bitcoins
from	the	exchange	itself.	Just	like	a	stock	exchange,	where	you	buy	shares
from	another	
user
	of	the	exchange	rather	than	from	the	exchange	
itself
,	a
cryptocurrency	exchange	is	the	website	that	allows	people	to	buy	and	sell
between	themselves.	The	exchange	itself	is	just	the	location	that	brings
together	buyers	and	sellers,	and	people	go	there	because	they	know	they
are	likely	to	get	the	best	prices	there.
In	financial	services	jargon,	the	exchange	is	an	
order	matching	engine
.	It
matches	buyers	and	sellers.	It	also	acts	as	the	
central	clearing
counterparty
.	All	matched	trades	appear	to	be	against	the	exchange
rather	than	between	the	customers	directly,	providing	anonymity	for
customers.	Finally,	the	exchange	is	the	
cash	and	asset	custodian
.	It
controls	customers’	fiat	money	in	its	bank	account	and	cryptocurrencies
in	its	wallet.
How	Do	Cryptocurrency	Exchanges
	
Work?
Exchanges	are	based	in	different	countries	and	support	different	fiat
currencies	and	different	cryptocurrencies.	They	all	work	roughly	the	same
way	using	the	same	four	steps:
1.
Create	account
2.
Deposit
3.
Trade
4.
Withdraw
Create
	
Account
To	use	an	exchange,	just	like	a	bank,	you	need	to	open	an	account.
Exchanges	are	coming	under	increasing	regulatory	scrutiny	due	to	the
fact	that	they	process	large	amounts	of	money.	The	top	cryptocurrency
exchanges	match	billions	of	dollars	of	buys	and	sells	per	day.	Most
legitimate	exchanges	follow	a	similar	account	opening	procedure	to
banks,	where	new	customers	submit	details	and	evidence	of	their
identity,	for	example	passport	and	utility	bills
147
.	The	documentation
needed	may	become	more	onerous	in	proportion	to	the	value	of	fiat	or
cryptocurrencies	you	plan	to	transact,	in	a	progressive	risk-based
approach.	Exchanges	are	now	big	business	and	take	these	processes
seriously.
Once	the	exchange	is	satisfied,	your	account	is	created.	Then	you	can	log
in	and	the	next	step	is	to	deposit.
Deposit
Before	you	can	attempt	to	buy	or	sell	anything	on	an	exchange,	you	need
to	fund	your	account.	This	is	like	funding	an	account	with	a	traditional
broker	before	being	allowed	to	buy	traditional	financial	assets.
Exchanges	have	bank	accounts	and	cryptocurrency	wallets.	In	order	to
fund	your	account	you	click	on	‘Deposit,’	then	follow	the	instructions.	If
you	are	funding	your	account	with	fiat	currency	(presumably	in	order	to
buy	cryptocurrency),	then	the	exchange	will	display	a	bank	account	for
you	to	make	a	fiat	currency	transfer	to.	If	you	are	funding	your	account
with	cryptocurrency,	(presumably	to	sell	for	fiat	currency	or	trade	for	a
different	cryptocurrency)	then	the	exchange	will	display	a	cryptocurrency
address	for	you	to	make	a	cryptocurrency	transfer	to.
Once	exchange	has	detected	the	transfer	to	their	bank	account	or
cryptocurrency	address,	the	balance	will	be	reflected	in	your	‘account
balance’	on	the	exchange’s	website,	and	you	are	ready	to	trade.
Trade
You	can	now	trade	up	to	the	amounts	you	have	deposited.	For	example,	if
you	have	deposited	USD	10,000,	then	you	can	buy	up	to	$10,000	worth
of	cryptocurrency.	If	you	have	deposited	3	BTC	then	you	can	sell	up	to	3
BTC	for	fiat	or	other	cryptocurrency	that	is	available	at	that	exchange.
Prices	are	expressed	in	pairs	that	look	something	like	this:	BTC/USD	or
BTCUSD	with	a	number	such	as	8,000.	The	way	to	read	this	is,	‘One	unit
of	BTC	costs	8,000	USD’.	Not	all	currencies	can	be	traded	for	each	other
—it	is	really	up	to	the	exchange	as	to	which	pairs	they	enable.	For
example	you	may	see	BTCUSD	and	BTCEUR	as	trading	pairs,	meaning
that	you	can	trade	BTC	with	USD	and	trade	BTC	with	EUR,	but	you	may
not	trade	USD	with	EUR	directly	if	you	don’t	see	EURUSD.	In	that	case,
to	convert	USD	into	EUR,	you’d	need	to	sell	USD	for	BTC	then	use	the
BTC	to	buy	EUR.
You	will	see	a	screen	of	other	people’s	bids	and	offers.	These	are	the
prices	at	which	they	are	willing	to	trade,	and	how	much	they	are	willing	to
trade	at	that	price.	You	can	decide	either	to	match	their	prices,	which	will
result	in	a	matched	trade,	or	submit	your	own	orders	which	will	rest	in
the	order	book	until	someone	matches	your	price	(if	they	ever	do).
This	is	a	
financial
	market—this	means	that	the	larger	amounts	you	want
to	buy	or	sell,	the	worse	the	prices	will	be.	This	is	unlike	a	supermarket
where	you	get	a	discount	for	buying	in	bulk.	This	is	confusing	for	some
people	initially,	but	it	is	easily	explained.	When	you	buy	something	on	an
exchange,	the	exchange	will	naturally	match	you	off	with	the	person	who
is	selling	it	at	the	cheapest	price.	When	you’ve	bought	all	that	they	have	to
offer,	you	have	to	find	the	next	best	price,	which	will	be	slightly	higher.
Selling	uses	the	same	logic:	when	you	sell	something,	the	exchange	will
match	you	with	the	person	who	is	willing	to	pay	the	highest	price	for	it.
When	you	have	sold	as	much	to	them	as	they	want	to	buy,	you	will	have
to	go	to	the	next	highest	price	which	will	be	slightly	lower.
Here	is	an	example	screenshot	of	Bitfinex,	a	typical	exchange:
On	the	left-hand	side	is	information	about	your	balances	in	each	currency
(not	shown	here	as	this	is	a	demonstration	account).	The	main	part	of	the
screen	shows	a	price	and	volume	chart—Bitcoin’s	price	and	how	many
bitcoins	have	been	traded.	And	the	bottom	third	shows	your	open	trades,
i.e.
	your	orders	that	haven’t	been	matched	yet,	and	the	full	order	book,
i.e.
	everyone’s	orders	to	buy	and	sell	bitcoins	and	their	amounts	and	price
levels.	A	ticker	is	shown	on	the	bottom	right	which	streams	the	prices	and
amounts	of	matched	trades	in	real-time.
Withdraw
Finally,	you	will	want	to	withdraw	fiat	currency	or	cryptocurrency.	To	do
so	you	have	to	instruct	the	exchange	where	you	want	it	to	go.	If	you	are
withdrawing	fiat,	you	will	need	to	tell	the	exchange	your	bank	account
details	for	them	to	make	the	transfer	to	you.	If	are	withdrawing
cryptocurrency,	you	need	to	tell	the	exchange	your	cryptocurrency
address	so	that	they	can	make	the	cryptocurrency	transaction.	Usually
cryptocurrency	withdrawals	are	faster	for	the	exchange	to	process	than
fiat	withdrawals	because	most	exchanges	have	‘hot	wallets,’	as	described
fiat	withdrawals	because	most	exchanges	have	‘hot	wallets,’	as	described
earlier,	which	automate	the	process	of	sending	small	amounts	of
cryptocurrency	back	to	users.
How	Do	Exchanges	Make
	
Money?
Exchanges	make	money	by	charging	fees,	just	like	your	stock	broker.
Different	exchanges	charge	different	fees	in	different	ways.	Some	charge
withdrawal	fees	(e.g.,	if	you	withdraw	$10,000,	then	they	might	send	you
$9,950,	and	you	would	receive	even	less	than	this	because	of	bank	fees).
Others	charge	by	taking	a	small	fraction	of	every	trade	you	do,	usually	by
reducing	the	amount	of	whatever	you	are	receiving.	For	example,	if	you
have	$8,000	in	your	exchange	account	and	use	it	to	buy	BTC	at	a	price	of
$8,000	per	BTC,	then	you	will	receive	slightly	less	than	1	BTC,	say	0.995
BTC.	Trading	fees	are	usually	determined	by	how	much	trading	you	do,
so	if	you	trade	more,	the	fee	rate	decreases	according	to	a	published	fee
schedule.
Pricing	On	Different
	
Exchanges
The	price	of	any	asset	at	a	cryptocurrency	exchange	depends	on	the
participants	using	the	exchange.	Different	exchanges	can	have	different
prices	for	each	cryptocurrency,	because	of	the	different	participants	using
the	exchange	and	the	different	levels	of	supply	and	demand	on	those
exchanges.	Usually	the	prices	are	within	a	few	percent	of	each	other.	If
they	get	too	out	of	line,	arbitrageurs	step	in	and	buy	the	bitcoins	from	the
exchange	where	they	are	cheap	and	sell	them	where	they	are	trading	at	a
premium.
The	extent	to	which	arbitrageurs	can	keep	doing	this	profitably	affects
how	aligned	the	prices	will	ever	become.	To	complete	the	circle	of	a
successful	arbitrage	you	need	to	move	the	fiat,	and	sometimes	this	will
have	costs	and	time	delays.	To	buy	bitcoins	on	the	cheap	exchange,	you
need	to	move	fiat	currency	there,	buy	bitcoins,	withdraw	the	bitcoins	and
send	them	to	the	more	expensive	exchange,	then	sell	them,	withdraw	the
fiat,	and	repeat	the	cycle.	Each	step	has	a	financial	cost	and	may	not	be
instant.	Some	countries	have	currency	controls,	which	hinder	cross
border	exchange	arbitrage.	This	is	why	there	can	be	price	differentials
between	exchanges	for	some	time.
In	late	2013-14,	the	exchange	Mt	Gox	traded	at	a	premium	to	its
competitor	Bitstamp,	because	people	found	they	couldn’t	withdraw	fiat
from	Mt	Gox,	so	instead	they	had	to	buy	bitcoins	and	withdraw	the
bitcoins	instead.	This	created	artificial	demand	for	bitcoins	on	Mt	Gox,
and	the	arbitrage	of	buying	cheap	bitcoins	on	Bitstamp	and	selling	them
on	Mt	Gox	didn’t	work	because	you	couldn’t	get	your	fiat	out	of	Mt	Gox!
Regulation
Cryptocurrency	exchanges	perform	activities	that	may	be	regulated	in
their	operational	jurisdictions.	The	fact	that	the	instruments	involved	are
cryptocurrencies	does	not	necessarily	mean	that	the	exchanges	escape
local	trading	and	tax	disclosure	requirements.	However,	depending	on
how	the	legislation	is	written,	and	owing	to	regulatory	uncertainty,	the
classification	of	cryptocurrencies,	exchanges	currently	operate	in	a	legal
grey	area,	especially	crypto-only	exchanges	who	allow	trades	between
cryptocurrencies	but	not	fiat.
Over the Counter (OTC) Brokers
When	you	buy	on	an	exchange,	you	are	buying	from	another	customer	of
the	exchange	in	quantities	and	prices	agreed	between	you	and	the	other
customer.	The	exchange	is	only	involved	with	the	deal	insofar	as	it	acts	as
an	escrow	agent	and	has	custody	of	
your
	money	and	the	
other	person’s
bitcoins
,	until	they	become	
your
	bitcoins	and	
the	other	person’s
	money.
Every	trade	is	shown	to	all	other	participants,	and	the	order	book	moves
in	real	time	in	response	to	the	trading	activity.	One	characteristic	of
exchange	trading	that	a	large	trader	may	wish	to	avoid	is	that
transparency.	Sometimes	you	want	to	trade	large	amounts	without	other
traders	knowing,	or	without	moving	the	market.
Enter	the	brokers.	These	are	people	or	companies	with	whom	you
establish	a	relationship.	Instead	of	showing	a	transparent	order	book	of
customer	orders	(as	the	exchanges	do),	the	brokers	will	buy	and	sell
directly	with	you,	negotiating	a	price	for	the	full	amount	that	you	want	to
transact,	in	what	are	known	as	‘block	trades’.	Trade	details	are	not
published	to	the	public.	They	are	private	transactions	in	bulk	and	there	is
nothing	illegal	about	this—this	also	happens	in	the	traditional	financial
markets.	Legitimate	brokers	also	apply	know-your-customer	processes	to
establish	your	identity	and	may	be	bound	by	local	disclosure
requirements.
When	you	trade	with	a	broker,	there	are	two	modes:	the	broker	could	act
as	
principal
	to	the	trade,	or	as	
agent
.
When	the	broker	acts	as	
principal
,	the	deal	is	just	between	you	and	the
broker.	They	are	the	counterparty	to	your	trade.	You	tell	them	what	you
want	to	do	(buy	or	sell)	and	in	what	amount,	and	they	will	tell	you	their
best	price	and	you	can	say	yes	or	no.	It	is	like	a	large	wholesale	trade,	and
the	broker	needs	to	have	enough	money	or	cryptocurrency	to	complete
the	deal.	In	accounting	jargon,	the	trade	is	on	the	broker’s	balance	sheet
because	the	broker	itself	is	trading	with	you.	This	is	the	case,	for	example,
when	you	buy	foreign	currencies	at	an	exchange	desk	at	an	airport.
When	the	broker	acts	as	
agent
,	the	deal	is	between	you	and	someone	else
with	whom	the	broker	is	in	touch.	The	broker	acts	as	an	intermediary
who	serves	to	provide	anonymity	to	both	parties.	In	accounting	jargon,
this	is	
off
	the	broker’s	balance	sheet—it’s	not	their	money,	they	are	just
matching	buyers	and	sellers.	Generally	the	way	this	works	is	that	you
contact	the	broker	and	tell	them	what	you	want	to	do,	then	the	broker	will
try	to	find	another	customer	who	wants	to	do	the	opposite	to	you	(the
other	side	of	the	trade).	The	broker	will	communicate	price	and	amount
information	to	both	sides	until	the	deal	is	agreed.	The	broker	takes	a	fee
from	one	or	both	customers	for	providing	this	service.
Due	to	the	large	amount	of	manual	overhead	and	small	margins,	brokers
usually	have	a	minimum	trade	size	below	which,	they	won’t	pick	up	the
phone.	This	can	be	anything	from	$10,000	to	$100,000	per	trade	and
seems	to	be	increasing	as	the	market	matures.
Localbitcoins
What	if	you	don’t	want	to	go	to	an	exchange	or	use	a	broker	or	provide
any	sort	of	identification?	There	is	a	website,	localbitcoins.com,	which
acts	a	bit	like	eBay	for	people	wanting	to	buy	and	sell	cryptocurrencies.
People	post	prices	at	which	they	are	willing	to	buy	and	sell	bitcoins.	You
can	browse	the	list	to	find	someone	nearby,	and	you	then	agree	to	send
them	money	in	return	for	bitcoins,	either	by	meeting	physically	with
fistfuls	of	banknotes,	or	by	making	bank	transfers	to	their	bank	account.
It	is	a	bit	like	a	bulletin	board	or	eBay,	and	there	is	a	reputation	system
with	ratings	and	feedback	comments.	It	also	has	an	escrow	function	for
the	temporary	custody	of	cryptocurrency.
Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?
We	now	come	to	the	question,	who	is	Satoshi	Nakamoto	and	why	does	it
matter?
Satoshi	was	the	author	of	the	Bitcoin	whitepaper	and	was	active	on
cypherpunk	mailing	lists	where	like-minded	people	discuss	ways	of
cypherpunk	mailing	lists	where	like-minded	people	discuss	ways	of
reclaiming	personal	privacy	in	the	electronic	age.	After	publishing	the
original	whitepaper,	Satoshi	continued	to	participate	on	Bitcoin	forums
until	December	2013,	and	then	vanished.
Satoshi	also	owns	or	controls	a	significant	number	of	bitcoins,	estimated
in	2013	by	cryptocurrency	security	consultant	Sergio	Lerner
148
	at	1	million
bitcoins.	This	represents	just	under	5%	of	the	total	21m	bitcoins	that	will
ever	be	created,	if	the	protocol	rules	don’t	change.	At	2018,	prices	of
around	$10,000	per	Bitcoin,	this	puts	the	nominal	value	of	the	bitcoins
controlled	by	Satoshi	at	$10bn.	If	Satoshi	ever	moves	any	bitcoins
thought	to	be	associated	with	him/her,	the	community	would
immediately	find	out.	The	transactions	would	be	visible	on	the	blockchain
and	addresses	thought	to	be	associated	with	Satoshi	are	monitored.	This
would	almost	certainly	affect	the	price	of	Bitcoin
149
.
Satoshi’s	real-world	identity	matters	because,	if	the	real	person	or	group
of	people	were	discovered,	their	views	and	voice	could	dominate	the
future	of	Bitcoin.	However,	this	centralisation	is	what	they	are	trying	to
avoid.	They	would	also	have	extremely	high	personal	security	risk.	It	is
never	a	good	idea	for	people	to	know	(or	even	believe)	that	you	have
significant	amounts	of	wealth,	especially	in	cryptocurrency.
We	have	seen	a	number	of	high	profile	cryptocurrency	owners	publicly
state	that	they	have	sold	all	their	cryptocurrencies.	In	Jan	2018,	Charlee
Lee,	founder	of	Litecoin	(LTC)	publicly	stated	that	he	sold	or	donated	all
his	LTC
150
.	In	the	same	month,	Steve	Wozniak,	founder	of	Apple,	also
stated	that	he	had	sold	all	of	his	Bitcoin
151
.	Although	they	have	their
reasons,	I	suspect	that	the	high	personal	risk	of	being	known	owners	of
high	valued	cryptocurrencies	also	feeds	into	this.	I	have	had
conversations	with	lucky	Bitcoin	owners	who	do	not	disclose	their
cryptocurrency	wealth	for	precisely	this	reason.
There	have	been	a	number	of	high	profile	attempts	at	exposing	Satoshi’s
identity.	These	are	known	in	the	industry	as	‘doxxings’:	the	public
revelation	of	an	internet	nickname’s	real-world	identity.	It	is	however
highly	unlikely	that	the	real	truth	about	Satoshi’s	identity	is	among	these
doxxings.
On	14	March	2014,	a	cover	article	for	
Newsweek
	magazine	claimed	that
Satoshi	was	a	sixty-four-year-old	Japanese	gentleman	named	Dorian
Nakamoto	(birth	name	Satoshi	Nakamoto)	living	in	California.
The	article	printed	the	suburb	where	Dorian	lived	and	included	a
photograph	of	his	house.	This	led	to	repeated	harassment	of	Dorian	and
his	family	over	the	course	of	the	next	few	weeks.	Of	course,	Dorian	was
not	Satoshi.	To	think	that	the	privacy	loving	cypherpunk	creator	of	a
revolutionary	unstoppable	anonymous	digital	currency	would	use	his
own	name	as	his	pseudonym	is	so	far-fetched	as	to	be	ludicrous.	To
identify	his	home	address	is	unethical.	Nevertheless,	and	despite	the	best
efforts	of	the	journalist	concerned,	anecdotal	evidence	suggests	that	after
a	period	of	great	distress,	Dorian	is	now	enjoying,	and	I	hope	monetising,
his	newfound	fame	as	the	real	fake	Satoshi.
In	December	2015,	an	article	in	
WIRED	Magazine
152
	suggested	that	Dr
Craig	Wright,	an	Australian	computer	scientist,	could	be	the	mastermind
behind	Bitcoin.	In	March	2016,	in	interviews	with	
GQ	magazine
153
,	the
BBC
,
154
	and	
The	Economist
	newspaper,
155
	Craig	claimed	to	be	the	leader	of
the	Satoshi	team.	He	even	published	his	own	blog	post,	now	taken	offline,
with	these	claims.	Craig	suggested	that	he	didn’t	want	to	self-doxx,	and
that	there	may	have	been	external	pressures	on	him	to	do	so.	In	June
2016,	the	
London	Review	of	Books
	published	a	long	form	article
156
	where
the	journalist,	Andrew	O’Hagan,	was	able	to	spend	an	extended	amount
of	time	with	Craig	Wright.	This	is	well	worth	a	read	in	full,	and	my
favourite	part	is:
Weeks later, I was in the kitchen of the house Wright was renting in London drinking tea with
him when I noticed a book on the worktop called Visions of Virtue in Tokugawa Japan. I’d
done some mugging up by then and was keen to nail the name thing.
‘So that’s where you say you got the Nakamoto part?’ I asked. ‘From the eighteenth-century
iconoclast who criticised all the beliefs of his time?’
‘Yes’.
‘What about Satoshi?’
‘It means “Ash,” ’ he said. ‘The philosophy of Nakamoto is the neutral central path in trade.
Our current system needs to be burned down and remade. That is what cryptocurrency does
—it is the phoenix …’
‘So, Satoshi is the ash from which the phoenix …’
‘Yes. And Ash is also the name of a silly Pokémon character. The guy with Pikachu’. Wright
smiled. ‘In Japan the name of Ash is Satoshi,’ he said.
‘So, basically, you named the father of Bitcoin after Pikachu’s chum?’
‘Yes,’ he said. ‘That’ll annoy the buggery out of a few people’. This was something he often
said, as if annoying people was an art.
Alas,	the	cryptographic	proofs	and	demonstrations	that	Dr	Wright
performed	on	and	off	camera	were	not	watertight,	and	the	community	is
still	undecided	as	to	the	veracity	of	his	claims.
A	few	other	Satoshi	suspects	have	been	cypherpunk	and	PGP	developer
Hal	Finney,	smart	contract	and	Bit	gold	inventor	Nick	Szabo,
cryptographer	and	creator	of	b-money	Wei	Dai,	e-donkey,	Mt	Gox,	and
Stellar	creator	Jed	McCaleb,	and	Dave	Kleiman.	Coindesk	has	a	more
extensive	list
157
	of	those	suspected	to	be	Satoshi.
My	bet	is	that	Satoshi	Nakamoto	is	not	an	individual	but	a	pseudonym	for
a	group	of	people	who	have	similar	political	views	and	who	wish	to
remain	anonymous.	Craig	Wright	may	have	been	part	of	that	team.	The
team	may	not	even	know	each	other’s	real-world	identities.	Some	of	the
team	may	have	died	since	Bitcoin’s	popularisation.	We	may	get	another
clue	in	2020	when	the	roughly	1	million	BTC	locked	in	the	Tulip	Trust
will	be	accessible.	The	Tulip	Trust	is	a	trust	fund	supposedly	created	by
Dave	Kleiman,	an	associate	of	Satoshi.	It	contains	early	bitcoins
potentially	owned	by	Satoshi.
If	you	decide	to	do	some	sleuthing,	there	are	a	few	things	to	remember
that	people	seem	to	have	forgotten:	A	digital	signature	proves	possession
and	use	of	a	private	key,	but	private	keys	can	be	shared	among	multiple
people.	So	you	cannot	guarantee	the	mapping	of	private	key	to	an
individual.	Private	keys	can	also	be	lost.	An	email	address	can	be	shared.
A	whitepaper	can	be	written	collaboratively,	so	grammatical	clues	simply
reveal	the	habits	of	the	editor,	not	necessarily	those	of	the	author.	It	is
very	hard	to	tie	the	identity	of	an	individual	to	the	author	of	a	paper.
On	the	other	hand,	it	may	be	better	if	Satoshi	is	not	found.
ETHEREUM
What is Ethereum?
The	vision	of	Ethereum	is	to	create	an	unstoppable,	censorship	resistant,
self-sustaining,	decentralised,	world	computer.	To	achieve	this,	Ethereum
builds	on	the	concepts	we	saw	with	Bitcoin.	If	you	consider	Bitcoin	as
trustless	validation	and	distributed	
storage
	of	(transaction)	data,
Ethereum	is	trustless	validation	and	distributed	
storage	and	processing
of	data	
and
	logic.
Ethereum	has	a	public	blockchain	running	on	15,000	computers
158
	and
the	token	on	the	blockchain	is	called	Ether,	currently	the	second	most
popular	cryptocurrency.
Like	Bitcoin,	Ethereum	is	also	a	bunch	of	
protocols
	written	out	as	
code
which	is	run	as	Ethereum	
software
	which	creates	Ethereum	
transactions
containing	data	about	Ether	
coins
	(ETH)	recorded	on	Ethereum’s
blockchain
.	In	contrast	with	Bitcoin,	Ethereum	transactions	can	contain
more	than	just	payment	data,	and	the	nodes	in	Ethereum	are	capable	of
validating	and	processing	much	more	than	simple	payments.
On	Ethereum,	you	can	submit	transactions	that	create	
smart	contracts
—
small	bits	of	general	purpose	logic	that	are	stored	on	Ethereum’s
blockchain	on	all	of	the	Ethereum	nodes.	These	smart	contracts	can	be
invoked	by	sending	Ether	to	them.	This	is	a	bit	like	deploying	a	juke
machine,	then	putting	coins	in	to	play	music.	When	a	smart	contract	is
invoked,	all	the	Ethereum	nodes	run	the	code	and	update	their	ledgers
with	the	results.	These	transactions	and	smart	contracts	are	run	by	all
participants	using	a	sort	of	operating	system	called	a	‘Ethereum	Virtual
Machine’.
Ethereum’s	blockchain	can	be	interrogated	using	websites	like
Ethereum’s	blockchain	can	be	interrogated	using	websites	like
etherscan.io.	As	with	Bitcoin,	there	are	also	forks	of	the	main	Ethereum,
such	as	Ethereum	Classic,	which	is	also	a	public	blockchain.	Each	fork
has	a	separate	coin	(Ethereum’s	coin	is	denoted	ETH	whereas	Ethereum
Classic’s	coin	is	denoted	ETC).	The	forks	have	a	shared	history	with
Ethereum	up	to	a	certain	point	in	time,	after	which	the	blockchains	differ
(we	will	discuss	forks	later).
Ethereum’s	code	can	also	be	run	as	a	private	network,	starting	a	new
blockchain	with	limited	participants.
How	Do	You	Run
	
Ethereum?
To	participate	in	the	Ethereum	network,	you	can	download	some
software	called	an	Ethereum	client,	or	you	can	write	some	yourself	if	you
have	the	patience.	Just	like	BitTorrent	or	Bitcoin,	the	Ethereum	client
will	connect	over	the	internet	to	other	people’s	computers	running
similar	client	software	and	start	downloading	the	Ethereum	blockchain
from	them	to	catch	up	with	the	latest	state	of	the	blockchain.	It	will	also
independently	validate	that	each	block	conforms	to	the	Ethereum
protocol	rules.
What	does	the	Ethereum	client	software	do?	You	can	use	it	to:
•
Connect	to	the	Ethereum	network
•
Validate	transactions	and	blocks
•
Create	new	transactions	and	smart	contracts
•
Run	smart	contracts
•
Mine	for	new	blocks
Your	computer	becomes	a	‘node’	on	the	network,	running	an	Ethereum
Virtual	Machine,	and	behaves	equivalently	to	all	the	other	nodes.
Remember	in	a	peer-to-peer	network	there	is	no	‘master’	server	and	each
computer	is	equivalent	in	status	to	any	other.
How Is Ethereum Similar to Bitcoin?
Ethereum	Has	an	Inbuilt
	
Cryptocurrency
Ethereum’s	token	is	called	Ether,	shortened	to	ETH.	This	is	a
cryptocurrency	that	can	be	traded	for	other	cryptocurrencies	or	other
sovereign	currencies,	just	like	BTC.	ETH	ownership	is	tracked	on	the
Ethereum	blockchain,	just	like	BTC	ownership	is	tracked	on	Bitcoin’s
blockchain.
Ethereum	Has	a
	
Blockchain
Like	Bitcoin,	Ethereum	has	a	blockchain,	which	contains	blocks	of	data
(Pure	ETH	payments	as	well	as	smart	contracts).	The	blocks	are	mined	by
some	participants	and	distributed	to	other	participants	who	validate
them.	You	can	explore	this	blockchain	on	etherscan.io.
Like	Bitcoin,	Ethereum	blocks	form	a	chain	by	referring	to	the	hash	of	the
previous	block.
Ethereum	is	Public	and
	
Permissionless
Like	Bitcoin,	the	main	Ethereum	network	is	a	public,	permissionless
network.	Anyone	can	download	or	write	some	software	to	connect	to	the
network	and	start	creating	transactions	and	smart	contracts,	validating
them,	and	mining	blocks	without	needing	to	log	in	or	sign	up	with	any
other	organisation.
When	people	talk	about	Ethereum	they	usually	mean	the	main	public
permissionless	version	of	the	network.	However,	like	Bitcoin,	you	can
take	Ethereum	software,	modify	it	slightly,	and	create	private	networks
that	are	not	connected	to	the	main	public	network.	The	private	tokens
that	are	not	connected	to	the	main	public	network.	The	private	tokens
and	smart	contracts	won’t	be	compatible	with	the	public	tokens	though,
just	like	private	Bitcoin	networks.
Ethereum	Has	Proof-of-Work	(PoW)	Mining
Like	Bitcoin,	mining	participants	create	valid	blocks	by	spending
electricity	to	find	solutions	to	a	mathematical	challenge.	Ethereum’s	PoW
maths	challenge,	called	Ethash,	works	slightly	differently	from	Bitcoin’s,
and	allows	more	common	hardware	to	be	used.	It	is	deliberately	designed
to	reduce	the	efficiency	edge	of	specialised	chips	called	ASICs,	which	are
common	in	Bitcoin	mining.	Commodity	hardware	is	allowed	to	compete
efficiently,	and	this	allows	for	a	greater	decentralisation	of	miners.	In
practice	though,	specialised	hardware	has	been	created	and	so	most
blocks	in	Ethereum	are	created	by	one	of	a	small	group	of	miners
159

On	Ethereum’s	roadmap	there	is	a	plan	to	move	from	electricity-
expensive,	proof-of-work	mining,	to	a	more	energy-efficient,	proof-of-
stake	mining	protocol	called	Casper	in	a	future	release	of	the	Ethereum
software	called	Serenity.	Proof-of-stake	is	a	mining	protocol	in	which
your	chance	of	creating	a	valid	block	is	proportional	to	the	number	of
coins	(ETH)	in	your	mining	wallet—contrast	this	to	proof-of-work,	where
coins	(ETH)	in	your	mining	wallet—contrast	this	to	proof-of-work,	where
your	chance	of	creating	a	valid	block	is	proportional	to	the	amount	of
computational	cycles	your	hardware	can	crunch	through.
How	might	this	impact	the	community?	For	starters,	this	would
dramatically	reduce	the	energy	footprint	of	the	cryptocurrency.	Miners
will	no	longer	need	to	consume	electricity	competitively	in	order	to	win
blocks.	On	the	other	hand,	some	people	think	that	proof-of-stake	is	less
democratic,	because	those	who	already	have	accumulated	a	lot	of	ETH
will	have	a	higher	chance	of	winning	more	blocks.	So,	the	argument	goes,
new	money	will	flow	towards	the	wealthy,	increasing	the	Gini
coefficient
160
	of	Ethereum	holders.
There	are	flaws	in	the	‘less	democratic’	argument.	With	proof-of-work	the
high	capital	costs	and	expertise	required	mean	that	only	a	very	small
minority	of	people	can	actually	make	money	mining,	so	it	is	not	actually
that	democratic.	Whereas	with	proof-of-stake,	every	ETH	has	an	identical
chance	of	winning	a	block,	so	you	can	get	started	with	much	less	capital.
Think	of	it	as	an	interest	rate:	If	you	have	more	money	you	get	more
interest,	but	at	least	those	with	small	amounts	of	money	can	still	get
interest.	I	also	think	that	reducing	the	negative	externalities	of	pollution
caused	by	proof-of-work	is	a	decent	and	honourable	goal.
How	Is	Ethereum	Different	from	Bitcoin?
This	is	where	it	gets	more	technical,	and	in	many	ways	more	complex.
The	Ethereum	Virtual	Machine	can	run	smart
	
contracts
When	you	download	and	run	the	Ethereum	software,	it	creates	and	starts
a	segregated	virtual	computer	on	your	machine	called	an	‘Ethereum
Virtual	Machine’	(EVM).	This	EVM	processes	all	the	Ethereum
transactions	and	blocks,	and	keeps	track	of	all	the	account	balances	and
results	of	the	smart	contracts.	Each	node	on	the	Ethereum	network	runs
the	same	EVM	and	processes	the	same	data,	resulting	in	them	all	having
the	same	view	of	the	world.	Ethereum	can	be	described	as	a	
replicated
state	machine
	because	all	of	the	nodes	running	Ethereum	are	coming	to
consensus	about	the	state	of	the	Ethereum	Virtual	Machine.
Compared	with	Bitcoin’s	primitive	scripting	language,	the	code	that	can
be	deployed	in	Ethereum	and	run	as	smart	contracts	is	more	advanced
and	approachable	for	developers.	We	will	describe	smart	contracts	in
more	detail	later,	but	for	now	you	can	think	of	smart	contracts	as	pieces
of	code	run	by	all	the	nodes	in	Ethereum’s	Virtual	Machine.
Gas
In	Bitcoin,	you	can	add	a	small	amount	of	BTC	as	a	transaction	fee	that
goes	to	the	miner	who	successfully	mines	the	block.	This	compensates	the
miner	for	checking	the	validity	of	the	transaction	and	including	it	in	the
block	they	are	mining.	Likewise,	in	Ethereum,	you	can	add	a	small
amount	of	ETH	as	a	mining	fee	which	goes	to	the	miner	who	successfully
mines	the	block.
The	complication	with	Ethereum	is	that	there	are	more	types	of
transactions.	Different	transaction	types	have	different	computational
complexities.	For	example,	a	transaction	performing	a	simple	ETH
payment	is	less	complex	than	a	transaction	to	upload	or	run	a	smart
contract.	Therefore,	Ethereum	has	a	concept	of	‘gas’	which	is	a	sort	of
price	list,	based	on	the	computational	complexity	of	the	different	types	of
operation	you	are	instructing	the	miners	to	make	in	your	transaction.
Operations	include	searching	for	data,	retrieving	it,	making	calculations,
storing	data,	and	making	changes	to	the	ledger.	Here	is	the	price	list	from
the	ethdocs.org	website,
161
	but	it	can	change	over	time	if	the	majority	of
the	network	agrees:
A	basic	transfer	of	ETH	from	one	account	to	another	uses	21,000	gas.
Uploading	and	running	smart	contracts	uses	more	gas	depending	on	their
complexity.	When	you	submit	an	Ethereum	transaction,	you	specify	a	gas
price	(how	much	ETH	you	are	willing	to	pay	per	gas	used)	and	a	gas	limit
(the	maximum	amount	of	gas	you	will	let	the	transaction	use).
Mining	fee	(in	ETH)	=	gas	price	(in	ETH	per	gas)	x	gas	consumed	(in	gas)
Gas
	
price
The	gas	price	is	the	amount	of	ETH	you	are	prepared	to	pay	per	unit	of
gas	for	the	transaction	to	be	processed.	As	with	Bitcoin	transaction	fees,
this	is	a	competitive	market,	and	in	general	the	busier	the	network	the
higher	the	gas	price	people	are	willing	to	pay.	In	times	of	great	demand
gas,	prices	spike.

. Peaks are usually related to popular
ICOs where many people are attempting to send ETH to ICO smart contracts. The
peak in December 2017 is related to the popular CryptoKitties Ethereum game. In
2018, the normal range for gas prices is between 0.000000005 ETH (5 Gwei) and
0.000000020 ETH (20 Gwei) per gas.
Gas
	
limit
The	gas	limit	you	set	provides	a	ceiling	for	how	much	gas	you	are
prepared	for	a	transaction	to	consume.	This	limit	protects	you	from	over-
spending	on	mining	fees	and	you	know	that	the	maximum	mining	fee	will
be	gas	limit	x	gas	price.	This	stops	you	over-paying	if	you	accidentally
submitted	a	very	complex	transaction	that	you	thought	was	simple.
Analogy	time:	Driving	your	car	10km	will	use	up	a	certain	amount	of	fuel.
If	you	run	out	of	fuel,	your	car	will	stop	before	reaching	the	destination.
The	price	of	fuel	is	dependent	on	market	conditions	and	can	go	up	and
down,	but	the	price	of	fuel	bears	no	relation	to	how	far	you	may	drive
your	car	with	it.	Gas	in	Ethereum	is	similar.	When	you	submit	an
Ethereum	transaction,	you	specify	how	much	gas	you’re	prepared	to
spend	on	making	the	transaction	‘work’	(this	is	the	
gas	limit
),	and	how
much	ETH	you	are	prepared	to	pay	the	miner	per	unit	of	gas	(this	is	the
gas	price
).	This	results	in	a	total	amount	of	ETH	you’re	prepared	to	pay
for	the	transaction	to	be	processed.
The	miner	will	execute	the	transaction	and	will	charge	you	the	amount	of
gas	taken,	multiplied	by	the	gas	price	you	specified.	As	with	Bitcoin,	the
mining	fee	is	up	to	you,	and	you	need	to	bear	in	mind	that	you’re
competing	with	other	transactions	which	may	have	set	a	higher	gas	price.
For	example,	a	basic	transaction	of	a	transfer	of	ETH	from	one	account	to
another	uses	21,000	gas,	so	you	can	set	the	gas	limit	for	this	kind	of
transaction	to	21,000,	or	higher;	but	it	will	only	use	21,000	gas.	If	you	set
the	gas	limit	below	the	amount	of	gas	it	takes	to	process	the	transaction,
the	transaction	will	fail	and	you	will	not	be	refunded	your	mining	fee.
This	is	like	trying	to	make	a	journey	with	insufficient	fuel	in	your	tank;
the	fuel	will	be	used,	but	you	will	not	get	to	your	destination.
ETH
	
Units
Just	like	one	dollar	can	be	split	into	100	cents,	1	BTC	can	be	split	into
100,000,000	Satoshi,	and	Ethereum	too	has	its	own	unit	naming
convention.
The	smallest	unit	is	a	Wei	and	there	are	1,000,000,000,000,000,000	of
them	per	ETH.	There	are	also	some	other	intermediate	names:	Finney,
Szabo,	Shannon,	Lovelace,	Babbage,	Ada—all	named	after	people	who
made	significant	contributions	to	fields	related	to	cryptocurrencies	or
networks.
Wei	and	Ether	are	the	two	most	common	denominations.	Wei	is	usually
used	for	gas	price	(a	gas	price	of	2-50	Giga-Wei	per	gas	is	common,	where
1	GWei	is	1,000,000,000	Wei).
Ethereum’s	block	time	is
	
shorter
In	Ethereum	the	time	between	blocks	is	around	14	seconds,	compared
with	Bitcoin’s	~10	minutes.	This	means	that,	on	average,	if	you	made	a
Bitcoin	transaction	and	an	Ethereum	transaction,	the	Ethereum
transaction	would	be	recorded	into	Ethereum’s	blockchain	faster	than	the
Bitcoin	transaction	into	Bitcoin’s	blockchain.	You	could	say	Bitcoin	writes
to	its	database	roughly	every	10	minutes,	whereas	Ethereum	writes	to	its
database	roughly	every	14	seconds.	The	history	of	Ethereum’s	block	times
has	been	quite	interesting,	as	you	can	see	on	bitinfocharts.com:

Source: Bitinfocharts
162
Compare	this	with	Bitcoin’s	relatively	stable	block	time	(note	the	time
scale,	as	Bitcoin	is	much	older	than	Ethereum):
Source: Bitinfocharts
163
Ethereum	has	smaller
	
blocks
Currently,	Bitcoin’s	blocks	are	a	little	under	1MB	in	size	whereas	most
Ethereum	blocks	are	about	15-20kb	in	size.	However,	we	should	not
compare	blocks	by	the	amount	of	data	in	them:	While	Bitcoin’s	maximum
block	size	is	specified	in	bytes,	Ethereum’s	block	size	is	based	on
complexity	of	contracts	being	run.	It	is	known	as	a	gas	limit	per	block,
and	the	maximum	is	allowed	to	vary	slightly	from	block	to	block.	So
whereas	Bitcoin’s	block	size	limit	is	based	on	amount	of	data,	Ethereum’s
block	size	limit	is	based	on	computational	complexity.
Source: Etherscan
164
Currently,	the	maximum	block	size	in	Ethereum	is	around	8	million	gas.
Basic	transactions,	or	payments	of	ETH	from	one	account	to	another	(i.e.,
uploading	or	invoking	a	smart	contract),	have	a	complexity	of	21,000	gas;
so	you	can	fit	around	380	of	those	basic	transactions	into	a	block
(8,000,000	/	21,000).	In	Bitcoin,	you	currently	get	around	1,500-2,000
basic	transactions	in	a	1MB	block.
Uncles:	blocks	that	don’t	quite	make
	
it
Because	Ethereum’s	rate	of	block	generation	is	much	higher	than
Bitcoin’s	(250	blocks	per	hour	on	Ethereum	vs	six	blocks	per	hour	on
Bitcoin),	the	rate	of	‘block	clashes’	increases.	Multiple	valid	blocks	can	get
created	at	almost	the	same	time,	but	only	one	of	them	can	make	it	into
the	main	chain.	The	other	one	‘loses,’	and	the	data	in	them	is	not
considered	part	of	the	main	ledger,	even	if	the	transactions	are
technically	valid.
In	Bitcoin,	these	non-mainchain	blocks	are	called	orphans,	or	orphaned
blocks,	and	they	do	not	form	part	of	the	main	chain	in	any	way	and	are
never	referenced	again	by	any	subsequent	blocks.	In	Ethereum	they	are
called	uncles.	Uncles	can	be	referenced	by	a	few	of	the	subsequent	blocks
and	although	the	data	in	them	is	not	used,	the	slightly	smaller	reward	for
mining	them	is	still	valid.
mining	them	is	still	valid.
This	achieves	two	important	things:
1.
It	incentivises	miners	to	mine	even	though	there	is	a	high	chance	of
creating	a	non-mainchain	block	(the	high	speed	of	block	creation
results	in	more	orphans	or	uncles)
2.
It	increases	the	security	of	the	blockchain	by	acknowledging	the
energy	spent	creating	the	uncle	blocks
Transactions	that	end	up	in	orphaned	blocks	simply	end	up	being	re-
mined	on	the	main	chain.	They	don’t	cost	the	user	any	more	gas,	because
the	transaction	in	the	orphaned	block	is	treated	as	if	it	was	never
processed.
Accounts
Bitcoin	uses	the	word	
address
	to	describe	accounts.	Ethereum	uses	the
word	account	but	technically	they	are	also	addresses.	The	words	seem	to
be	more	interchangeable	with	Ethereum.	Maybe	you	can	say,	‘What’s	the
address	of	your	Ethereum	account?’	It	doesn’t	seem	to	matter
165
.
There	are	two	types	of	Ethereum	accounts:
1.
Accounts	that	only	store	ETH
2.
Accounts	that	contain	smart	contracts
Accounts	that	only	store	ETH	are	similar	to	Bitcoin	addresses	and	are
sometimes	known	as	Externally	Owned	Accounts.	You	make	payments
from	these	accounts	by	signing	transactions	with	the	appropriate	private
key.	An	example	of	an	account	that	stores	ETH	is
0x2d7c76202834a11a99576acf2ca95a7e66928ba0
166
.
Accounts	that	contain	smart	contracts	are	activated	by	a	transaction
sending	ETH	into	it.	Once	the	smart	contract	has	been	uploaded	it	sits
there	at	an	address,	waiting	to	be	used.	An	example	of	an	account	that
has	a	smart	contract	is
0xcbe1060ee68bc0fed3c00f13d6f110b7eb6434f6
167
.
ETH	token
	
issuance
The	issuance	of	Ether	tokens	is	a	bit	more	complicated	than	Bitcoin.	The
number	of	ETH	in	existence	are:	Pre-mine	+	Block	rewards	+	Uncle
rewards.
Source: Etherscan
168
Pre-mine
Around	72	million	ETH	were	created	for	the	crowdsale	in	July/Aug	2014.
This	is	sometimes	called	a	‘pre-mine’	as	they	were	just	written	in	rather
than	mined	through	proof-of-work	hashing.	These	were	distributed	to
initial	supporters	of	the	project	and	to	the	project	team	itself.	It	was
decided	that	after	the	initial	crowdsale,	future	ETH	generation	would	be
capped	at	25%	of	the	pre-mine	total,	i.e.,	no	more	than	18m	ETH	could	be
mined	per	year.
Block
	
rewards
Originally,	each	block	mined	created	five	fresh	ETH	as	the	block	reward.
Due	to	concerns	about	oversupply,	this	was	reduced	to	3	ETH,	in	a	set	of
changes	to	the	protocol	called	the	Byzantium	update,	in	October	2017
(block	4,370,000).
Source: Etherscan
169
Uncle
	
rewards
Some	blocks	are	mined	but	do	not	form	part	of	the	main	blockchain.	In
Bitcoin,	these	are	called	‘orphans’	and	are	entirely	discarded,	and	the
miner	of	the	orphaned	block	receives	no	rewards.	In	Ethereum,	these
discarded	blocks	are	called	‘uncles’	and	
can
	be	referenced	by	later	blocks.
If	a	later	block	references	an	uncle,	the	miner	of	the	uncle	gets	some	ETH.
This	is	called	the	‘uncle’	reward.	The	miner	of	the	later	block	referencing
the	uncle	also	gets	an	additional	small	reward	called	an	‘uncle
referencing’	reward.
The	uncle	reward	used	to	be	4.375	ETH	(7/8th	of	the	full	5	ETH	reward).
It	was	reduced	in	the	Byzantium	upgrade	to	0.625-2.625	ETH.
It	was	reduced	in	the	Byzantium	upgrade	to	0.625-2.625	ETH.

The	biggest	difference	between	ETH	and	BTC	token	generation	is	that
BTC	generation	halves	approximately	every	4	years	and	has	a	planned
finite	cap,	whereas	ETH	generation	continues	to	be	generated	at	a
constant	number	every	year	indefinitely.	Like	any	other	parameter	or
rule,	however,	this	rule	is	subject	to	ongoing	debate	and	can	be	changed	if
the	majority	of	the	Ethereum	network	agrees.
The	future	of	ETH
	
generation
The	Ethereum	community	hasn’t	yet	come	to	agreement	about	what
happens	to	the	rate	of	issue	when	Ethereum	moves	from	proof-of-work	to
proof-of-stake.	Some	argue	that	perhaps	the	rate	at	which	ETH	is	created
should	decrease,	as	the	value	will	not	have	to	subsidise	competitive
electricity	usage.
Mining
	
rewards
In	Bitcoin,	the	miner	of	a	block	receives	the	block	reward	(new	BTC),	plus
transaction	fees	for	transactions	mined	(existing	BTC).	In	Ethereum,	the
miner	of	a	block	receives	the	block	and	uncle	referencing	rewards	(new
ETH),	plus	mining	fees	(gas	amount	x	gas	price)	from	transactions	and
contracts	that	were	run	during	the	block.
Other	parts	to	Ethereum:	Swarm	and
	
Whisper
Computers	need	to	be	able	to	calculate,	store	data,	and	communicate.	For
Ethereum	to	realise	its	vision	as	an	unstoppable,	censorship	resistant,
Ethereum	to	realise	its	vision	as	an	unstoppable,	censorship	resistant,
self-sustaining,	decentralised,	‘world’	computer,	it	needs	to	be	able	to	do
those	three	things	in	an	efficient	and	robust	way.	The	Ethereum	Virtual
Machine	is	just	one	component	of	the	whole,	the	element	which	does	the
decentralised	calculations.
Swarm	is	another	component.	This	is	for	peer-to-peer	file	sharing,	similar
to	BitTorrent,	but	incentivised	with	micropayments	of	ETH.	Files	are
split	into	chunks,	distributed	and	stored	with	participating	volunteers.
These	nodes	that	store	and	serve	the	chunks	are	compensated	with	ETH
from	those	storing	and	retrieving	the	data.
Whisper	is	an	encrypted	messaging	protocol	that	allows	nodes	to	send
messages	directly	to	each	other	in	a	secure	way	and	that	also	hides	the
sender	and	receiver	from	third	party	snoopers.
Governance
Although	Bitcoin	and	Ethereum	are	both	open	source	projects	and	open,
permissionless	networks,	one	of	the	biggest	differences	between	them	is
that	Bitcoin	doesn’t	have	an	active,	identified	leader,	whereas	Ethereum
does.	Vitalik	Buterin,	the	creator	of	Ethereum	is	hugely	influential,	and
his	opinions	count.	Although	he	can’t	stop	his	creation	or	censor
transactions	or	participants,	his	vision	and	commentary	have	a	big
impact	on	the	technology.	For	instance,	he	championed	a	hard	fork	to
recover	funds	stolen	in	the	DAO	hack	(this	is	explained	later).	He	also
proposes	changes	to	the	protocol	rules	and	the	network	economics.
Bitcoin,	on	the	other	hand,	has	a	few	influential	developers,	but	none
with	the	clout	that	Vitalik	has	with	Ethereum.	Nick	Tomaino	argues	in	a
blog	post
170
	that	the	governance	of	blockchains	‘may	prove	to	be	as
important	as	the	computer	science	and	economics	of	blockchains’.
Whether	a	single	influencer	is	good	or	bad	for	decentralised
cryptocurrency	networks	is	still	be	determined.
Smart Contracts
Smart	contracts	mean	different	things	depending	on	the	blockchain
platform.	Ethereum	smart	contracts	are	short	computer	programs	that
are	stored	on	Ethereum’s	blockchain,	replicated	across	all	the	nodes,	and
are	available	for	anyone	to	inspect.	There	are	two	steps	that	are
performed	separately:
1.
Uploading	the	smart	contract	to	Ethereum’s	blockchain
2.
Making	the	smart	contract	run
You	upload	a	smart	contract	by	sending	the	code	to	miners	in	a	special
transaction.	If	the	transaction	is	successfully	processed,	the	smart
contract	will	then	exist	at	a	specific	address	on	Ethereum’s	blockchain
171
.
You	may	then	make	it	run	by	creating	a	transaction	that	says	‘Please	run
the	smart	contract	found	at	address	x’.
Here	is	an	example	of	a	basic	smart	contract.	It	creates	a	token	called
‘GavCoin’	that	initially	issues	1	million	GavCoins	to	the	creator	of	the
smart	contract,	and	then	allows	them	to	send	GavCoins	to	other	users
172
:

For	a	real	example	of	a	smart	contract,	the	smart	contract	that	holds	the
balances	of	the	Indorse	ICO	tokens	can	be	found	at	address
0xf8e386eda857484f5a12e4b5daa9984e06e73705
173
.
Once	a	contract	has	been	uploaded,	it	behaves	a	bit	like	a	jukebox.	When
you	want	to	run	it,	you	create	a	transaction	pointing	to	the	contract	and
supply	whatever	information	the	contract	expects.	You	pay	gas	to	the
miner	to	run	it.	As	part	of	the	mining	process,	each	miner	will	execute	the
transaction,	which	involves	running	the	smart	contract.
The	miner	who	successfully	wins	the	proof-of-work	challenge	will	publish
the	winning	block	to	the	rest	of	the	network.	The	other	nodes	will	validate
the	block,	add	the	block	to	their	own	blockchains,	and	process	the
transactions,	including	running	the	smart	contracts.	This	is	how
Ethereum’s	blockchain	gets	updated,	and	how	the	state	of	the	EVMs	on
each	node’s	machine	is	synchronised.
Ethereum	smart	contracts	are	described,	‘Turing	complete’.	This	means
that	they	are	fully	functional	and	can	perform	any	computation	that	can
be	done	in	any	other	programming	language.
Smart	Contract	languages:	Solidity	/	Serpent,	LLL	(Lisp	Like
Language)
The	most	common	language	that	Ethereum	smart	contracts	are	written	in
is	Solidity.	Serpent	and	LLL	can	also	be	used.	Smart	contracts	written	in
these	languages	will	all	compile	and	run	on	Ethereum	Virtual	Machines.
•
Solidity	is	similar	to	the	language	JavaScript.	This	is	currently	the
most	popular	and	functional	smart	contract	scripting	language.
•
Serpent	is	similar	to	the	language	Python	and	was	popular	in	the
early	history	of	Ethereum.
•
LLL	is	similar	to	Lisp	and	was	used	mainly	in	the	very	early	days
only.	It	is	probably	the	hardest	to	write	in.
Ethereum	software:	geth,	eth,	pyethapp
The	three	official	Ethereum	clients	(full	node	software)	are	all	open
source.	You	can	see	the	code	behind	them	and	tweak	them	to	make	your
own	versions.	They	are:
•
geth
174
	(written	in	a	language	called	Go)
•
eth
175
	(written	in	C++)
•
pyethapp
176
	(written	in	Python)
These	are	all	command-line	based	programs	(think	green	text	on	black
backgrounds)	and	so	additional	software	can	be	used	for	a	nicer	graphical
interface.	Currently,	the	most	popular	graphical	interface	is	Mist
(
https://github.com/Ethereum/mist
),	which	runs	on	top	of	geth	or	eth.
So,	geth/eth	does	the	background	stuff,	and	Mist	is	the	pretty	screen	on
top.
Currently	the	most	popular	Ethereum	clients	are	geth	and	Parity
177
.	Parity
is	Ethereum	software	built	by	a	company	called	Parity	Technologies.	It	is
also	open	source
178
	and	is	developed	in	the	Rust	programming	language.
Ethereum’s History
Ethereum	is	a	highly	successful	public	blockchain	by	adoption,
mindshare,	and	the	number	of	developers	working	on	Ethereum	smart
contracts	and	decentralised	apps.	Below	is	a	short	history	of	Ethereum,
and	some	difficult	periods	in	its	history	that	it	has	managed	to	overcome.
2013
Vitalik	Buterin	described	Ethereum	as	a	concept	in	a	white	paper	in	late
2013.	This	concept	was	developed	by	Dr	Gavin	Wood	who	published	a
technical	yellow	paper	in	April	2014.	Since	then,	the	development	of
Ethereum’s	software	has	been	managed	by	a	community	of	developers.
A	crowdsale	took	place	in	July	and	August	2014	to	fund	development,
and	Ethereum’s	live	blockchain	was	launched	on	30	July	2015.	You	can
see	the	very	first	block	here:	
https://etherscan.io/block/0
Ethereum
	
crowdsale
The	development	team	was	funded	by	an	online	sale	of	ETH	tokens
during	July	to	August	2014	where	people	could	buy	ETH	tokens	by
paying	in	Bitcoin.	Early	investors	received	2,000	ETH	per	BTC,	and	this
was	gradually	reduced	to	1,337	ETH
179
	per	BTC	over	the	course	of	about	a
month,	to	encourage	investors	to	invest	early.
Crowdsale	participants	sent	bitcoins	to	a	Bitcoin	address	and	received	an
Ethereum	wallet	containing	the	number	of	ETH	bought.	Technical	details
are	on	Ethereum’s	blog
180
.
A	little	over	60m	ETH	was	sold	this	way	for	more	than	31,500	BTC,	worth
about	US$18m	at	the	time.	An	additional	20%	(12m	ETH)	were	created	to
fund	development	and	the	Ethereum	Foundation.
Software	Release
	
codenames
Frontier,	Homestead,	Metropolis,	and	Serenity	are	friendly	names	for
versions	of	the	core	Ethereum	software,	a	little	like	Apple’s	OS	X	version

Launched	May	2015—a	testing	release	where	coins	are	not	compatible	with	‘real’	ETH.	A	testnet	still	runs	in	parallel	to	the
main	live	network	so	that	developers	can	test	their	code.	The	testnet	operates	in	the	same	way	as	the	live	network	but	there	is
much	less	mining	competition	as	the	coins	are	not	tradeable	on	exchanges—they	are	defined	has	having	zero	value.
Frontier
Launched	30	July	2015—an	initial	live	release	with	a	way	for	people	to	mine	ETH	and	build	and	run	contracts.
Homestead
Launched	14	March	2016—some	protocol	changes,	more	stability.
Metropolis
This	was	designed	to	prepare	Ethereum	for	a	move	from	proof-of-work	to	proof-of-stake.	Metropolis	was	split	into	two
upgrades,	Byzantium	and	Constantinople.	Byzantium	was	released	in	October	2017	at	block	4,370,000.	It	included	changes	to
set	the	stage	for	private	transactions,	sped	up	transaction	processing	(important	for	scalability),	and	improved	some	smart
contract	functionality.	The	most	visually	obvious	change	was	reducing	the	mining	reward	from	5	ETH	per	block	to	3	ETH.	The
Constantinople	upgrade	will	be	another	upgrade	to	set	the	stage	for	the	move	to	proof-of-stake	(Casper).
Serenity
Future	launch—moving	from	proof-of-work	to	proof-of-stake	(Casper).
	
The	DAO
	
Hack
There	is	a	concept	called	a	‘Decentralised	Autonomous	Organisation’.	The
idea	is	that	an	automated	company	or	entity	runs	itself	according	to	some
encoded	charter,	without	human	intervention	or	management.	It	just
does	what	it	says	it	will	do.	A	common	example	is	a	self-driving	taxi	that
makes	money	by	providing	a	taxi	service	and	can	go	and	get	itself
repaired	or	filled	with	petrol.	Call	me	old	fashioned,	but	this	sounds
fantastical	to	me	without	a	human	ultimately	responsible	for	the	actions
of	the	taxi.
Anyway,	some	enthusiasts	seem	to	love	the	idea.	In	2016,	a	team	from	a
German	company	called	Slock-it	pivoted	from	their	business	model	of
making	smart	locks	that	can	be	opened	using	tokens	on	blockchains	and
built	a	sort	of	automated	venture	capital	(VC)	company	as	a	smart
contract	deployed	on	Ethereum’s	public	blockchain.	They	called	it	‘The
DAO’	(note	the	capitalisation).	This	is	a	confusing	name,	it	is	like	calling	a
bank	‘The	Bank’	or	a	company	‘The	Company’.	Anyway,	
The	DAO
	is	an
example	of	
a
	DAO.
The	idea	behind	The	DAO	is	that	it	would	be	a	cryptocurrency	fund	for
funding	startups.	Investors	who	want	to	invest	in	relevant	startups	would
send	money	(in	the	form	of	ETH)	to	the	smart	contract,	and	the	smart
contract	would	issue	them	DAO	tokens	in	proportion	to	their	investment.
The	smart	contract	would	be	the	pot	of	money	used	to	fund	the	startups,
like	a	traditional	VC	fund.
In	a	normal	VC	fund,	the	investors,	called	Limited	Partners,	give	money
to	the	fund	and	expect	the	management	of	the	VC	firm	to	manage	the
funds	and	to	generate	a	return	by	investing	in	successful	ventures.	In	The
DAO,	the	investors	would	have	a	more	active	role.	They	would	receive
DAO	tokens	in	return	for	their	investment,	and	use	them	to	vote	on	what
startups	receive	funding.	In	this	way	the	investors	would	have	direct
input	into	which	startups	get	funding,	instead	of	devolving	that
responsibility	to	a	management	team.	The	smart	contract	would	govern	a
voting	process,	and	at	the	end	of	a	vote,	cryptocurrency	would	be	released
to	the	startups	that	had	the	most	funding	votes.	That	was	the	theory
behind	The	DAO.
Of	course,	there	
was
	actually	human	intervention.	Someone—a
management	team—had	to	curate	a	list	of	potential	startups	that
investors	could	vote	on,	so	in	fact	it	wasn’t	much	of	a	DAO	after	all.	All	it
did	was	automate	the	provision	of	funds.	Anyway,	none	of	this	really
mattered	because	the	DAO	failed	before	it	invested	in	a	single	startup.
Over	a	one	month	funding	period	in	May	2016,	The	DAO	managed	to
raise	the	equivalent	of	over	$150m	USD	in	ETH	from	over	11,000
separate	addresses.	This	suggests	a	large	number	of	investors,	but	it	is
hard	to	tell,	as	a	single	investor	may	have	multiple	ETH	addresses.	ETH
was	trading	between	$10	and	$20	per	ETH	and	The	DAO	held	about	15%
was	trading	between	$10	and	$20	per	ETH	and	The	DAO	held	about	15%
of	all	ETH	in	existence.
In	June,	a	hacker	managed	to	find	a	way	to	get	the	DAO	to	release
3,641,694	ETH,	then	worth	about	$50-60m,	into	another	account
controlled	by	the	hacker.	This	sent	the	price	of	ETH	down	almost	50%.
When	the	hack	was	discovered	and	investigated,	some	white-hat	(ethical)
hackers	replicated	the	attack	and	drained	the	rest	of	the	ETH	into	their
own	accounts.	This	is	like	the	goodies	stealing	money	from	a	broken	vault
so	that	the	baddy	can’t	steal	it.	Now	remember,	that	smart	contracts
simply	do	as	they	promise	they	will	do,	and	DAOs	just	do	as	they	have
been	programmed.	The	user	agreement	is	right	there	in	the	code.	If	you
find	a	way	to	get	the	smart	contract	to	do	something	that	it	has	been
programmed	to	do,	and	it	does	it,	is	it	a	hack	or	is	it	just	behaving
according	to	the	rules	which	you	all	subscribed	to?
Anyway,	this	was	considered	a	hack	and	the	Ethereum	Foundation
suggested	an	update	for	all	Ethereum	participants	which	would	in	effect
freeze	the	ETH	that	had	been	drained	by	specifying	a	blacklist	which
would	invalidate	any	transactions	trying	to	spend	money	from	the	theft
account.	This	goes	against	the	vision	of	a	censorship	resistant	world
computer,	but	this	was	an	emergency,	and	many	early	supporters	of
Ethereum	were	in	danger	of	having	their	money	stolen.	So	lost	money
took	precedence	over	values.	The	pressure	on	the	Ethereum	Foundation
to	find	a	way	to	‘unwind’	the	transaction	must	have	been	huge.	Just
before	the	proposed	implementation	of	this	change,	a	bug	was	found	with
the	proposed	change,	so	the	blacklist	wasn’t	adopted.	The	Ethereum
Foundation	then	made	a	proposal	to	unwind	the	specific	transactions
related	to	the	theft	and	allow	DAO	investors	to	withdraw	their	invested
ETH.
Again,	this	transgressed	the	very	principles	of	a	censorship	resistant
Again,	this	transgressed	the	very	principles	of	a	censorship	resistant
world	computer.	In	cryptocurrencyland,	it	is	apparently	fine	to	cheer	for
censorship	resistance,	unless	you’ve	lost	money.
In	July	2016,	a	vote	was	taken	to	determine	the	fate	of	the	stolen	Ether,
and	the	result	was	that	the	community	decided	to	install	an	upgrade	in
what	is	known	as	a	hard	fork,	that	would	move	the	stolen	Ether	to	a	new
smart	contract	and	have	them	returned	to	the	original	investors.
This	was	quite	controversial.	After	all,	an	unstoppable	immutable	world
computer	was	stopped	and	mutated	to	cater	to	a	small	number	of	people
who	lost	a	lot	of	money	to	a	smart	contract	which	functioned	exactly	as	it
specified	it	would.
Ethereum
	
Classic
A	small	but	vocal	part	of	the	community	thought	that	unwinding
contradicted	the	values	of	Ethereum	and	continued	with	the	old
Ethereum	software.	This	resulted	in	two	Ethereum	blockchains,	one
which	returned	the	stolen	funds	to	the	DAO	investors,	another	which
didn’t.	The	one	that	didn’t	became	known	as	Ethereum	Classic.	Ethereum
and	Ethereum	Classic	have	a	shared	history	until	block	1,920,000	(July
2016)	after	which	point	the	blockchains	diverge.	Anyone	who	owned	ETH
before	the	fork,	now	had	an	equal	amount	of	ETH	(tokens	recorded	on
the	Ethereum	blockchain)	and	ETC	(tokens	recorded	on	the	Ethereum
Classic	blockchain).	This	was	good	for	anyone	who	had	ETH	before	the
hard	fork	as,	to	all	intents	and	purposes,	they	received	free	money	in	the
form	of	ETC

The	Parity
	
Bug
Parity	is	a	piece	of	Ethereum	software	written	by	Parity	Technologies.	It
acts	as	a	full	node	on	the	Ethereum	network,	storing	the	blockchain,
running	contracts,	forwarding	transactions,	
etc.
	At	time	of	writing,	about
a	third	of	Ethereum	nodes	run	Parity	software.
Source: Ethernodes
182
Parity	also	contains	some	advanced	wallet	software	that	you	can	use	to
store	ETH.	The	wallet	has	had	a	couple	of	critical	bugs.	On	20	July	2017,
Parity’s	code	was	updated	to	fix	a	bug	that	had	enabled	a	hacker	to	steal
$32m	worth	of	ETH	from	Parity	multi-signature	wallets.	However,	this
update	itself	contained	a	bug:	A	smart	contract	was	deployed	which	was
relied	upon	for	some	wallet	functionality,	but	it	had	a	vulnerability.
Anyone	could	convert	this	smart	contract	into	a	multi-signature	wallet,
take	ownership	of	it,	and	then	suicide	it,	destroying	this	particular	piece
of	code	on	which	multi-signature	wallets	created	after	20	July	relied,
freezing	the	assets	in	the	wallets.
So,	someone	with	the	Github	handle	devops199	‘Did	just	that	on	6	Nov
2017
183
:’
Almost	600	wallets	were	affected,	with	a	combined	balance	of	over	half	a
million	ETH,	valued	at	the	time	at	about	$150m.	Ironically,	Gavin	Wood,
founder	of	Parity	Technologies,	had	about	300k	ETH	in	a	Parity	wallet
related	to	funds	raised	in	an	ICO	called	Polkadot.	Those	funds	are	frozen.
The	ETH	are	still	there	in	the	wallets,	but	currently	can’t	be	sent.	As	of
early	2018,	developers	are	still	investigating	if	anything	can	be	done	to	fix
this	bug.
Actors in the Ethereum Ecosystem
The	Ethereum
	
Foundation
The	Ethereum	Foundation	is	a	non-profit	organisation	registered	as
‘Stiftung	Ethereum’	in	Switzerland	whose	mission	is	to:
Promote and support Ethereum platform and base layer research, development and
education to bring decentralized protocols and tools to the world that empower developers to
produce next generation decentralized applications (dapps), and together build a more
globally accessible, more free and more trustworthy Internet.
184
The	Foundation’s	job	is	to	manage	the	funds	raised	in	the	Ether	pre-sale
in	any	way	that	furthers	Ethereum.	Mainly	it	pays	the	core	development
team	a	salary,	but	it	also	offers	grants	to	developers	to	tackle	specific
problems.	For	instance,	in	March	2018,	grants	were	awarded	to	fund
projects	that	provided	scaling	and	security	solutions	to	Ethereum
185
.
Vitalik	Buterin,	known	as	the	creator	of	Ethereum,	sits	on	the	council	of
the	foundation,	and	the	foundation	has	a	great	deal	of	influence	into	the
roadmap	of	Ethereum.	In	theory,	Ethereum	participants	(miners,
bookkeepers)	don’t	have	to	implement	any	software	changes	made	by	the
Foundation,	but	in	practice	they	do.
Ethereum	Enterprise
	
Alliance
The	Ethereum	Enterprise	Alliance	is	a	non-profit	industry	group
launched	in	March	2017	whose	goal	seems	to	be	to	make	Ethereum
suitable	for	enterprise	use.	From	their	materials,	it	is	hard	to	understand
whether	this	means	businesses	using	the	public	Ethereum	blockchain,	or
if	it	means	adapting	the	Ethereum	code	to	make	it	suitable	for	industry
use	cases.
The	website
186
	says:
The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance connects Fortune 500 enterprises, startups, academics, and
technology vendors with Ethereum subject matter experts. Together, we will learn from and
build upon the only smart contract supporting blockchain currently running in real world
production—Ethereum—to define enterprise-grade software capable of handling the most
complex, highly demanding applications at the speed of business.
From	the	website	the	vision	of	the	EEA	is	to:
•
Be	an	open	source	standard,	not	a	product
•
Address	enterprise	deployment	requirements
•
Evolve	in	tandem	with	advances	in	public	Ethereum
•
Leverage	existing	standards
Unfortunately,	I	could	not	find	any	further	detail	as	to	what	this	means.
The	mission	of	the	Alliance	states:
•
EEA	is	a	501	(c)	(6)	non-profit	corporation.
•
A	clear	roadmap	for	enterprise	features	and	requirements.
•
Robust	governance	model	and	accountability,	clarity	around	IP	and
licensing	models	for	open	source	technology.

Ether Price
Like	Bitcoin,	the	price	of	Ether	has	also	been	through	ups	and	downs.
Ethereum’s	crowdsale	was	at	a	price	of	2,000	ETH	to	1	BTC,	and	at	the
time	(July-Aug	2014),	1	BTC	was	worth	about	$500,	making	1	ETH	=
$0.25.	At	its	peak	in	early	2018,	the	price	of	ETH	almost	touched	$1,500.
So,	to	date,	Ether	has	been	a	highly	successful	cryptocurrency	in	terms	of
price.
Compared	to	Bitcoin,	Ethereum	has	an	additional	use	case.	Its	token	ETH
is	often	used	in	ICOs.	A	company	that	runs	an	ICO	will	create	a	smart
contract	on	Ethereum	which	will	automatically	create	tokens	and	assign
them	to	Ethereum	addresses	who	have	sent	Ether	to	a	related	smart
contract.	This	means	you	can	run	an	automated	ICO	on	Ethereum,	as
long	as	investors	pay	in	ETH	or	another	token	recorded	on	Ethereum.
FORKS
What	is	a	cryptocurrency	fork?	When	people	use	the	word	
fork
	they	can
mean	two	different,	but	related	things:
1.
A	fork	of	a	codebase
2.
A	fork	of	a	live	blockchain	(a	
chainsplit
)
The	difference	is	whether	you’re	creating	an	entirely	new	ledger,	which	is
achieved	by	forking	a	codebase	(the	code	behind	the	node	software),	or
creating	a	new	coin	that	has	a	shared	history	with	an	existing	coin	by
forking	a	blockchain.	Let’s	explore	both	of	these.
A Fork of a Codebase
A	fork	of	a	codebase	in	general	is	where	you	copy	the	code	of	a	particular
program	so	you	can	contribute	to	it	or	adapt	it.	This	is	encouraged	in
open	source	software,	where	code	is	deliberately	shared	for	anyone	to
tinker	with.
In	cryptocurrency,	this	means	that	you	copy	the	code	behind	a	popular
cryptocurrency	node	software	(e.g.,	Bitcoin	Core),	maybe	tweak	it	and
change	a	few	parameters,	and	then	run	the	code	to	create	an	entirely	new
blockchain	starting	from	a	blank	ledger.	You’d	say	you	forked	Bitcoin’s
code	to	create	a	new	coin.	This	is	how	many	alt-coins	(alternative	coins)
were	created	in	2013-14.	Litecoin	for	example	was	created	using	a	copy	of
Bitcoin’s	code	with	some	parameters	changed,	including	the	speed	of
block	generation	and	the	kind	of	calculations	that	the	miners	had	to	in
the	proof-of-work	challenge.
The	key	here	is	that,	when	you	run	the	new	code,	you	create	a	new	‘empty’
blockchain	ledger	from	scratch—with	an	entirely	new	Genesis	block.
In	the	popular	open	source	code-sharing	platform	GitHub,	you	can	easily
In	the	popular	open	source	code-sharing	platform	GitHub,	you	can	easily
fork	(copy)	a	project’s	code	with	a	few	clicks	of	a	mouse.	You	then	have
your	very	own	copy	which	you	can	edit.	These	codebase	forks	are
common	and	encouraged	in	open	source	technology	development,	as	they
lead	to	innovation.
A Fork of a Live Blockchain: Chainsplits
A	fork	of	a	live	blockchain,	better	described	as	a	
chainsplit
,	is	more
interesting.	Chainsplits	can	happen	by	accident	or	on	purpose.
An	
accidental
	chainsplit	is	when	there	is	an	uncontentious	upgrade	to	the
blockchain	software	and	some	proportion	of	the	network	omits	or	forgets
to	upgrade	their	software,	leading	to	a	number	of	blocks	being	produced
by	them	that	are	incompatible	with	the	rest	of	the	network.	According	to
BitMEX	research
188
,	this	has	happened	a	few	times	in	Bitcoin’s	history,
with	three	identified	chainsplits	lasting	approximately	51,	24,	and	6
blocks,	in	2010,	2013,	and	2015,	respectively.	So	forks	can	occur	even
when	there	is	no	contention	over	rule	changes,	creating	some	temporary
confusion	as	to	the	‘real’	state	of	the	blockchain	during	the	period	where
there	is	more	than	one	candidate	blockchain.
Accidental	chainsplits	tend	to	be	resolved	quickly	with	the	small
proportion	of	participants	upgrading	their	software	and	discarding	the
incompatible	blocks.
A	
deliberate
	chainsplit	occurs	when	a	group	of	participants	of	a	live
network	thinks	that	things	should	be	done	a	different	way	from	the	rest	of
the	participants,	and	runs	some	new	software	with	changes	to	the
protocol	rules	to	create	a	new	coin	that	has	a	shared	history	with	the	old
coin.	This	deliberately	splits	the	chain	at	a	specific	block	according	to	a
well	communicated	plan.	Deliberate	chainsplits	can	be	successful,	with
both	assets	continuing	to	live	and	develop,	or	fail,	where	there	is	not
enough	participatory	interest	and	the	value	of	the	token	drops	to	zero,
and	stops	being	mined.
To	execute	a	successful	deliberate	chainsplit,	you	need	to	publicly	rally
and	persuade	a	group	of	miners,	bookkeepers,	exchanges,	and	wallets
that	your	new	rules	are	better	than	the	existing	rules.	They	will	need	to
agree	to	support	your	new	coin,	creating	a	community	supporting	a	new
coin	that	people	can	buy	and	sell,	store	and	use.	When	the	chain	splits,
you	have	created	a	new	coin	with	different	protocol	rules	but	which	has	a
shared	history	with	the	original	coin.	Anyone	with	a	balance	on	the
blockchain	before	the	split	now	has	a	balance	in	two	different	coins	after
the	split.
So	the	determination	of	whether	something	is	a	protocol	upgrade,	a	failed
fork,	or	a	successful	fork	is	really	about	who	chooses	to	adopt	the	new
rules:
•
If	new	protocol	rules	are	adopted	by	the	vast	majority	of	the
community,	then	it	is	called	a	protocol	upgrade,	and	those	who	don’t
upgrade	have	a	choice	to	maintain	the	old	rules	as	an	attempted	fork
or	to	join	the	majority.
•
If	new	protocol	rules	are	adopted	by	very	few	participants,	you	have
an	unviable	fork	which	may	ultimately	fail.
•
If	new	protocol	rules	are	adopted	by	enough	participants	to	maintain
a	community	and	interest	then	it	is	a	successful	fork.
What’s the Result of a Deliberate, Successful
Fork?
The	upshot	is	that	anyone	who	owned	some	of	the	original
cryptocurrency	continues	to	have	the	original	cryptocurrency,	plus	the
same	number	of	tokens	in	new	forked	cryptocurrency.
same	number	of	tokens	in	new	forked	cryptocurrency.
Quick	analogy:	Imagine	you	usually	fly	with	an	airline	called	CryptoAir
where	you	earn	loyalty	points,	and	let’s	say	you	have	accumulated	500
points	with	them.	Now	imagine	that	some	staff	from	CryptoAir	get	upset
and	leave	to	create	their	own	separate	airline,	NewCryptoAir.	They	take	a
copy	of	the	customer	list	with	them,	including	the	record	of	how	many
loyalty	points	each	customer	has.	Now	you	have	500	points	with
CryptoAir	
and
	500	points	with	NewCryptoAir.	But	you	can’t	spend	your
NewCryptoAir	points	with	CryptoAir	or	vice	versa.	They	are
incompatible.	If	you	then	spend	points	with	one	airline,	it	doesn’t	affect
your	points	on	the	other	airline.	Your	old	CryptoAir	points	continue	to
have	whatever	value	they	had,	whereas	your	new	NewCryptoAir	points
will	need	to	establish	their	own	value.	Not	a	perfect	analogy	but	I	think	it
is	helpful.
If	coin	holders	had	100	tokens	before	a	successful	cryptocurrency	fork,
have	they	‘doubled	their	money?’	In	one	sense,	yes,	they	have	doubled	the
number	of	tokens	they	have,	as	they	now	have	100	units	of	the	old	coin
and	100	units	of	the	new	coin,	and	they	can	spend	them	independently.
In	reality,	they	haven’t	doubled	their	
money
,	as	the	two	coins	(original
plus	new)	have	different	fiat	currency	values.	In	practice,	the	old	currency
tends	to	maintain	its	fiat	value,	whereas	the	new	one	must	float	on
exchanges	with	a	new	ticker	symbol,	and	it	will	usually	start	trading	at	a
lower	value.
How Does a Deliberate Chainsplit Work?
Participants	of	a	fork	make	changes	to	the	protocol	rules	and	market	their
philosophy	to	a	wide	audience	of	miners,	wallet	software	providers,
exchanges,	merchants,	and	users.	They	then	coordinate	to	switch	over	to
the	new	rules	at	a	planned	time,	determined	by	a	specific	block	number
known	as	a	
block
	
height
.
At	that	planned	time,	two	incompatible	blocks	are	mined,	one	that	is
valid	for	the	incumbent	participants,	and	the	other	that	is	valid	for	the
rebellious	participants.	The	blockchain	splits	into	two,	because	what	is
acceptable	on	one	blockchain	is	not	acceptable	on	the	other.	Consider	the
very	first	transaction	that	is	created	that	breaks	the	old	rules	but
conforms	to	the	new	rules.	This	rebellious	transaction	will	be	rejected	by
the	old	school	participants,	who	will	not	propagate	it,	mine	it,	or	add	it	to
their	blocks.	However,	it	will	be	treated	as	valid	by	the	rebellious
validating	nodes,	and	will	get	mined	by	a	rebellious	miner,	and	the
rebellious	block	will	be	added	to	the	blockchains	of	the	rebellious
participants.
So	now	there	are	two	blockchains,	recording	transactions	of	two	different
coins	which	share	a	common	history	up	to	the	point	of	the	split.	The	coins
will	have	different	symbols	and	names	to	differentiate	them,	wallets	need
to	be	configured	to	accept	the	new	coin,	exchanges	need	to	list	the	new
coin	to	create	a	market	for	it,	and	merchants	and	other	participants	need
to	accept	the	new	coin.
Media Descriptions
Forks,	or	specifically	chainsplits,	are	often	described	in	the	media	as	a
‘stock	split’.	This	is	a	poor	analogy	because,	in	a	stock	split,	more	shares
are	created	and	assigned	to	shareholders	but	the	old	and	the	new	shares
all	represent	the	same	thing.	This	is	not	the	case	in	a	cryptocurrency
chainsplit.	A	‘spinoff’	is	a	more	accurate	analogy	because	in	a	spinoff,
shareholders	of	the	old	company	get	new	shares	of	a	new	company.	This
is	similar	to	a	fork	where	holders	of	the	original	coin	also	get	the	new	coin
which	has	different	rules	from	the	old	coin.
which	has	different	rules	from	the	old	coin.
Hard Forks vs Soft Forks
Sometimes	the	terms	hard	and	soft	fork	are	used.	These	terms	refer	to
changes	in	the	rules	about	what	constitutes	a	valid	transaction	and	block.
A	soft	fork	is	a	change	in	the	rules	that	is	backwards	compatible,	meaning
that	blocks	created	under	the	new	changed	rules	will	still	be	considered
valid	by	participants	who	didn’t	upgrade.
A	hard	fork	is	a	change	in	the	rules	that	is	not	backwards	compatible,	so
that	if	some	participants	fail	to	upgrade,	there	will	be	a	chainsplit.
In	practice,	if	changes	to	protocol	rules	are	tightened	or	more
constrained,	this	results	in	a	soft	fork,	whereas	if	consensus	rules	are
loosened,	then	this	is	a	hard	fork.

	is	a	(currently)	successful	fork	of	Bitcoin,	created	as	a	hard
fork.	Bitcoin	Cash	and	Bitcoin	(sometimes	called	Bitcoin	Core	to	reduce
confusion)	had	a	shared	history	until	block	478,558	when	the	chain	split.
The	philosophy	of	Bitcoin	Cash	is	to	more	accurately	reflect	the	vision	in
the	original	Satoshi	whitepaper	of	fast,	cheap,	decentralised,	censorship
resistant,	digital	cash,	and	proponents	believe	that	Bitcoin	Core	has	not
been	making	progress	towards	this	vision.
So	far,	Bitcoin	Cash	has	been	regarded	as	successful,	as	it	is	supported	by
popular	wallet	software,	merchants	accept	it,	and	it	trades	on	popular
cryptocurrency	exchanges	under	the	ticker	symbol	BCH.
Case Study 2: Ethereum Classic

Ethereum	Classic	is	a	(currently)	successful	fork	of	Ethereum.	It	was
created,	as	we	saw	earlier,	after	The	DAO	was	hacked	and	more	than
$50m	of	ETH	was	drained	from	it.	As	we	have	seen,	the	Ethereum
community	deliberated	as	to	what	to	do	and	the	majority	decided	to	hard
fork	at	block	1,920,000	and	restore	the	hacked	ETH	to	the	original
holders.
But	a	minority	of	the	community	saw	this	restoration	as	revisionist	and
anti-ethical	and	refused	to	hard	fork,	so	they	continued	on	with	the
original	blockchain,	theft	and	all.	So	in	a	sense,	Ethereum	itself	is	the
fork,	as	it	had	additional	code	to	neutralise	the	hack	of	The	DAO,	and
Ethereum	Classic	is	the	original	Ethereum.	But	because	Classic	was	in	the
minority,	it	is	regarded	as	the	fork.
Ethereum	Classic	trades	on	cryptocurrency	exchanges	under	the	ticker
symbol	ETC	and	is	widely	supported	by	wallets.
Other Forks
Forks	are	trendy.	It	is	easier	to	take	something	that	is	proven	to	already
work	than	to	build	something	from	scratch.	And,	as	cryptocurrencies
tend	to	be	open	source,	it	is	legal	to	copy	the	code,	tweak	it,	and	run	it.
Community	building	with	a	forked	chain	is	easier	than	building	a	new
blockchain	too.	Anyone	who	had	a	balance	on	the	original	chain	will	also
have	a	balance	on	the	new	chain,	so	they	are	more	likely	to	support	a	fork
where	they	have	a	balance,	rather	than	support	a	new	blank	blockchain.
People	saw	that	Bitcoin	Cash	successfully	forked	and	retained	some
currency	value,	so	this	spurred	many	copycats	to	try	the	same.	However,
there	is	only	so	much	energy	in	the	cryptocurrency	space,	and	there
seems	to	be	some	‘fork	fatigue’.	Some	commentators	predict	that	many
future	forks	will	fail.

Part 5
DIGITAL
	
TOKENS
WHAT ARE DIGITAL TOKENS?
Terminology	is	evolving	quickly.	While	bitcoins	and	other
cryptocurrencies	are	all	referred	to	as	‘digital	tokens’	in	a	generic	sense
(as	in	‘a	Bitcoin	is	a	digital	token’),	a	distinction	now	seems	to	be
emerging	between	
cryptocurrencies
,	such	as	BTC	and	ETH	whose	coins
are	tracked	on	their	respective	blockchains,	and	
tokens
	which	are	usually
issued	by	an	issuer	during	an	Initial	Coin	Offering	(ICO)	and	tracked
within	smart	contracts	on	Ethereum’s	blockchain.	The	word	‘token’	can
mean	different	things	depending	on	the	context	in	which	it	is	used
191
.
What	are	tokens?	What	is	a	digital	token?	Why	is	it
	
important?
It	is	easy	to	understand	what	a	‘token’	is	in	the	physical	world.	Think	of
round	plastic	things	like	casino	chips,	beer	vouchers,	or	fairground	ride
tokens.	Essentially	a	token	is	something	which	is	issued	by	an	issuer	(the
casino,	the	beer	festival	organisers,	or	the	fairground)	and	can	be	used	in
a	specific	context	or	in	a	specific	marketplace,	perhaps	under	specific
conditions	or	timings.	The	token	has	value	because	the	context	gives	it
value,	but	if	you	take	the	token	outside	the	context	the	value	decreases	or
falls	to	zero.	While	a	$5	casino	chip	is	worth	$5	inside	a	casino,	it	would
be	worth	less	on	the	other	side	of	the	world.	And	fairground	ride	tokens
would	not	be	worth	much,	if	anything,	outside	the	context	of	the
fairground.
But	what	do	people	mean	when	they	talk	about	
digital
	tokens?	If	you
digitise	a	beer	voucher	or	casino	chip	does	it	become	a	digital	token?	Is	a
balance	in	a	PayPal	wallet	a	digital	token?	Is	a	bank	balance	a	digital
token?	What’s	special	about	a	Bitcoin?
The	characteristics	of	the	different	types	of	token	vary	widely,	and
generalisations	lead	to	confusion.	In	this	section,	I	hope	to	clarify	the
different	types	and	characteristics	of	tokens	by	differentiating	between
blockchain-native
	tokens	like	BTC	and	ETH,	
asset	backed	tokens
	like
IOUs,	and	
utility	tokens
	that	can	be	spent	on	goods	or	services	at	a	later
date,	usually	recorded	within	smart	contracts	on	the	Ethereum
blockchain	as	‘ERC-20’	standard	tokens
192
,	but	may	also	be	recorded	on
other	blockchains.
Owning	a
	
Token
We	can	be	more	specific	and	use	the	term	
cryptoasset
.	Ownership	of	any
cryptoasset,	whether	it	is	a	cryptocurrency	or	a	token,	is	vested	in	the
person	who	has	the	private	key	that	corresponds	to	the	address	with
which	the	token	is	associated.	This	private	key	allows	that	person—the
owner—to	create	and	sign	transactions	releasing	the	token	and	assigning
it	to	someone	else.	In	some	respects,	cryptoassets	are	like	bearer	assets—
if	you	hold	the	private	key,	it	is	yours
193
.
The	rules	of	blockchains	require	that	if	a	token	is	to	be	sent	(i.e.,	if	a
payment	to	be	made),	the	transaction	must	include	the	digital	signature
related	to	the	token’s	current	address.	This	digital	signature	is	validated
by	all	of	the	blockchain	network	participants.	The	digital	signature	acts	as
a	single	point	of	authentication	to	signal	that	it	really	is	the	address
owner	who	is	making	the	payment	instruction.
With	online	banking,	in	contrast,	you	prove	that	you	are	you	then	instruct
the	bank	to	do	something	on	your	behalf.	You	provide	a	username	and
password	and	usually	a	one-time	PIN	created	on	another	device—a	so
called	‘second	factor’.	Authenticating	with	a	username	and	password	has
its	benefits.	If	you	forget	or	lose	your	password,	you	can	have	it	reset	if
you	supply	more	proof	that	you	are	the	account	holder.
With	a	cryptoasset,	transactions	must	have	a	valid	digital	signature.	If
you	lose	your	private	key,	you	cannot	access	your	asset	and	you	cannot
have	it	reset.	If	your	private	key	is	copied	the	thief	can	make	transactions
on	your	behalf,	and	you	can’t	stop	them.	In	this	respect	cryptocurrencies
are	much	less	forgiving	than	banks.	Not	even	those	who	maintain	the
ledger	can	alter	the	balances,	because	they	can’t	provide	the	necessary
digital	signatures.	This	is	different	to	a	traditional	ledger	maintained	by	a
bank,	which	can	be	alter	balances	without	any	kind	of	cryptographic
proofs.
Some	people	say	that	with	Bitcoin,	you	are	your	own	bank.	You	don’t
instruct	an	entity	to	make	a	payment	on	your	behalf:	you	are	responsible
for	making	payments	yourself.
Categorising
	
Tokens
New	tokens	are	emerging	almost	daily.	Their	properties	vary.	While
segregation	and	separation	are	difficult,	I	currently	think	of	tokens	in
three	categories:
Native	blockchain	tokens
,	which	are	essential	for	the	underlying
blockchain	to	work	or	be	incentivised.	Native	tokens	are	usually	the
incentive	for	block-creators	to	do	their	work.	Cryptocurrencies	are
usually	native	tokens.
Asset	backed	tokens
,	which	represent	title	or	ownership	to	some	real-
world	asset	held	in	trust	by	a	custodian.
Utility	tokens
,	which	represent	a	claim	on	a	service	provided	by	the
issuer	of	the	token.
Data	website	onchainfx.com	provides	these	categories	for	digital
tokens
194
:
Currency	Tokens:
	Currency	tokens	are	native	blockchain	assets
intended	to	be	used	as	money.	Networks	classified	as	currencies
typically	do	not	have	many	‘features’	beyond	those	necessary	to	define
and	transfer	the	native	blockchain	asset.
Platform	Tokens:
	Platform	tokens	are	required	to	use	general
purpose	decentralised	networks	that	support	a	wide	variety	of	possible
applications.	Platform	tokens	are	often	used	specifically	to	mediate	use
of	the	platform	(ie,	tokens	are	used	to	pay	‘gas’	in	order	to	access	the
platform’s	functionality).
Utility	Tokens:
	Utility	tokens	are	native	to	decentralised	networks
that	are	designed	for	specific	application	types.	That	is,	they	are	open
networks	but	designed	with	a	specific-use-case	in	mind.	For	example,
decentralised	storage	and	decentralised	asset	exchange	are	both	use-
types	for	which	targeted	networks	(and	their	corresponding	tokens)	are
being	built.	The	terms	‘Utility	Tokens’	and	‘Protocol	Tokens’	are	often
used	to	describe	the	same	type	of	token.
Brand	Tokens:	
Brand	tokens	exist	as	tradeable	digital	assets	for	use
mostly	on	one	company/entity’s	platform.	Some	Brand	Tokens	may
evolve	into	more	generalised	Utility	Tokens	over	time.
Security	Tokens:
	Security	tokens	represent	a	claim	on	a	specific
cash-flow,	or	off-chain	asset.	Networks	which	generate	fees-for-service
that	accrue	to	token	holders,	explicitly	grant	voting	rights	to	token
holders,	or	where	tokens	are	said	the	be	‘backed’	by	some	other	asset,
such	as	gold	or	company	equity,	are	Security	Tokens.
In	the	section	on	ICOs	we	will	discuss	how	tokens	may	be	classified	by
regulators	as	financial	securities.	For	now,	I	will	describe	my	own
distinctions	between	native	tokens,	asset	backed	tokens,	and	utility
tokens.
tokens.
Native Blockchain Tokens
Here	I	will	use	the	word	‘token’	generically	to	mean	any	units	recorded	on
any	blockchain.
Cryptocurrencies	such	as	Bitcoin	and	Ethereum	use	native	tokens	BTC
and	ETH	respectively.	These	units	are	needed	to	incentivise	miners	to
create	valid	blocks	without	an	external	party	to	fund	the	participants.
ETH	is	also	used	to	pay	Ethereum	miners	to	run	smart	contracts.	The
tokens	are	also	known	as	‘intrinsic’	or	‘built-in’	tokens.	They	are
inseparable	from	their	blockchain	systems,	and	are	used	both	as	an
incentive	for	participants	to	keep	the	blockchains	running,	and	as	a
payment	mechanism	to	use	the	blockchains.
How	do	these	native	tokens	come	into
	
existence?
Intrinsic	tokens	are	created	by	the	same	blockchain	software	that	keeps
track	of	ownership	of	these	units.	They	are	created	transparently	by
software	in	the	mining	process	according	to	a	schedule	defined	by	the
blockchain	protocol.	All	participants	agree	to	abide	by	the	protocol	rules.
What	backs	native
	
tokens?
Nothing	‘backs’	these	native	tokens.	They	just	exist	and	have	value.	The
gold	analogy	is	useful	here.	When	you	hold	physical	gold	it	is	not	‘backed’
by	anything;	it	is	just	valuable	in	itself.	With	native	tokens	there	
is
	no
issuer	to	whom	you	can	return	a	token,	to	redeem	for	an	underlying	asset,
any	more	than	you	can	go	to	a	‘gold	issuer’	(mother	nature?)	and	redeem
your	gold	for	something	else.
Satoshi	Nakamoto	created	the	
idea
	of	Bitcoin,	but	is	not	the	issuer	of	the
BTC	units.	Bitcoin	miners	
create
	BTC	according	to	some	mutually	agreed
constraints,	but	they	are	no	more	the	
issuer
	of	BTC	than	a	gold-
prospector	is	the	
issuer
	of	the	gold	that	they	discover.
Where	do	native	tokens	derive	their
	
value?
Their	value	comes	partly	from	their	usefulness	and	partly	from	their
speculative	value.	Let’s	use	the	gold	analogy	again.	Gold	derives	its	value
from	two	sources.	Firstly,	it	is	useful	for	filling	gaps	in	your	teeth,	for
certain	technical	or	industrial	processes,	and,	because	it	is	pretty	and
doesn’t	tarnish,	for	wearing	as	jewellery.	Secondly,	gold	has	a	speculative
value	arising	from	its	scarcity,	general	desirability,	and	its	long	price
history.
Native	tokens	are	useful	because	they	can	be	used	in	a	specific	context.
The	context	for	the	BTC	token	is	the	Bitcoin	blockchain	and	the	context
for	the	ETH	token	is	the	Ethereum	blockchain.	Bitcoins,	like	gold,	don’t
represent
	an	asset,	they	
are
	the	asset.	As	considered	in	our	earlier
discussion	about	different	types	of	money,	bitcoins	are	representative
money.	Native	tokens	also	have	speculative	value	as	some	people	want	to
buy	and	hold	them,	just	like	any	other	asset	that	speculators	can	buy	and
hold.
Examples	of	native
	
tokens
Some	of	the	more	well-known	examples	of	intrinsic	tokens:
•
BTC	on	the	Bitcoin	blockchain
•
ETH	on	Ethereum
•
NXT	on	the	NXT	platform
•
XRP	on	the	Ripple	network
There	are	many	more,	and	they	all	differ	slightly.	Since	2018,	native
tokens	that	are	not	issued	or	backed	by	anyone	have	been	increasingly
described	as	‘cryptocurrencies’.	The	word	‘token’	is	increasingly	confined
to	those	tokens	issued	by	projects	which	
are
	redeemable	for	a	product	or
service	at	a	later	stage.	But	definitional	boundaries	are	blurred.	For
example,	ETH,	although	widely	described	as	a	cryptocurrency,	was	issued
by	the	Ethereum	Foundation	during	their	crowdsale,	whereas	BTC	has
not	been	issued	by	anyone.	EOS	tokens	were	issued	before	their
blockchain	went	live	and	those	tokens	can	be	swapped	into	native	tokens
that	run	on	their	blockchain.	I	suspect	that	terminology	will	continue	to
be.
What	are	intrinsic	tokens
	
for?
As	discussed,	intrinsic	tokens	are	the	incentives	for	miners	to	do	their
jobs.	But	each	blockchain	has	its	nuances.	We	have	explored	BTC	and
ETH	in	detail	earlier.	Ripple	and	NXT	are	two	other	cryptocurrencies
which	have	some	interesting	twists.
The	Ripple	network	uses	tokens	called	ripples,	with	a	ticker	symbol	XRP
aligned	with	the	ISO	currency	standards.	On	the	Ripple	network	all,	the
XRP	tokens	were	created	at	the	beginning—all	the	XRP	that	will	ever
exist	were	
pre-mined
	and	shared	out	among	key	participants.	Each
transaction	on	the	Ripple	network	needs	to	include	a	small	amount	of
XRP	as	a	transaction	fee.	Unlike	Bitcoin	and	Ethereum,	XRPs	are
destroyed	by	block	makers,	rather	than	being	claimed	by	them	as	is	the
case	with	Bitcoin	and	Ethereum.	Therefore	the	total	number	of	XRPs	in
circulation	decreases	with	time.	The	XRPs	destroyed	in	each	transaction
ensures	that	transactions	have	a	tiny	cost,	preventing	transaction	spam
which	can	happen	if	transactions	are	costless	to	create.
The	NXT	network	uses	pre-mined	NXT	tokens.	Each	transaction	on	the
NXT	network	requires	a	fee	to	be	added.	The	fee	goes	to	the	block	maker
(in	NXT	this	is	called	a	‘forger’	instead	of	a	‘miner’).	Therefore,	the	total
number	of	NXT	remains	constant	with	time.
Asset Backed Tokens
Any	financial	asset	can	be	recorded	as	a	token,	either	directly,	where	the
token	
is
	the	financial	asset,	or	as	a	depository	receipt,	where	the	token	is	a
claim	on	a	custodian
	for	the	financial	asset.	You	may	think	of	a	share	or	a
bond	as	a	physical	object,	but	financial	assets	are	nothing	but	
agreements
between	parties,	usually	an	issuer	and	the	owner	of	the	asset.	For
example,	a	share	of	a	company	is	a	legal	agreement	between	the	issuer
company	and	the	owner	of	the	share;	a	bond	is	a	legal	agreement	between
the	issuer	and	the	holder	of	the	bond;	a	loan	is	a	legal	agreement	between
the	borrower	and	lender.	Money	itself	is	an	agreement	between	two
parties.	Deposits	in	a	bank	account	are	an	agreement	between	the	bank
and	the	depositor,	with	many	provisions	including	daily	transaction
limits,	daily	withdrawal	limits,	interest,	
etc.
	A	banknote	is	an	agreement
between	the	central	bank	and	the	bearer.
These	agreements	can	all	be	represented	as	tokens	recorded	on
blockchains	or	distributed	ledgers.
Asset	backed	digital	tokens	take	a	number	of	forms:
1.
Depository	receipt	tokens
2.
Title	tokens
3.
Contract	tokens
Depository Receipt Tokens
Depository	receipts	are	tokens	that	are	claims	on	a	specific	entity	for	an
underlying	item.	You	can	think	of	them	as	a	digital	version	of	a
goldsmith’s	receipt	for	gold	stored	in	their	vault,	or	like	a	digital	version
of	a	cloakroom	ticket	or	left-luggage	ticket.	The	tokens	represent
ownership	of	the	underlying	item	held	in	trust	by	a	custodian.	The	receipt
ownership	of	the	underlying	item	held	in	trust	by	a	custodian.	The	receipt
could	be	for	real	world	physical	objects,	such	as	gold,	or	for	a	financial
asset,	such	as	a	share	of	a	company.	When	a	token	holder	wants	to
redeem	a	token,	they	go	to	the	issuer	with	the	token	to	claim	back	the
underlying	asset.	The	issuer	then	destroys	the	token	once	they	have
returned	the	underlying	asset.
Title Tokens
Title	tokens	are	a	slightly	different	concept.	They	are	the	digital	document
that	represents	proof	of	ownership	of	an	asset,	for	example	a	digital	title
document	to	a	car	or	house.	Unlike	a	depository	receipt	token,	the	item	is
not	necessarily	under	someone	else’s	custody.
How Do Asset Backed Digital Tokens Work?
Let’s	take	the	example	of	Goldchain	Inc,	a	fictitious	entity.	It	stores
physical	gold	bullion	in	its	vault	on	behalf	of	itself	and	its	account	holders
who	have	bought	some	of	that	gold.	It	issues	digital	tokens	called
GoldchainOz	to	the	account	holders	when	they	buy	that	gold.	Each	token
represents	1	oz	of	the	gold	bullion	stored.	These	gold	tokens	are	recorded
on	a	blockchain.	They	may	be	recorded	in	smart	contract	on	the	public
Ethereum	blockchain,	or	on	a	private	Ethereum	blockchain,	as	assets	on
any	number	of	other	public	blockchains	or	private	blockchains	such	as
Corda.	It	doesn’t	really	matter	for	these	illustrative	purposes.	What
matters	is	the	ability	for	a	customer	of	Goldchain	Inc	to	withdraw	the
tokens	and	keep	them	in	a	wallet	where	they,	and	only	they,	have	the
private	keys.
Let’s	assume	you	want	to	acquire	1	oz	of	their	gold	bullion.	So:
1.
You	create	an	account	with	Goldchain	Inc	by	going	to	their	website.
2.
You	make	a	bank	transfer	of	fiat	funds	to	Goldchain’s	bank	account
to	fund	your	account.
3.
After	a	period	of	time	(hours	or	days	depending	on	how	long	your
bank	transfer	takes	to	get	to	Goldchain’s	bank),	Goldchain	sends	you
an	email	indicating	they	have	checked	their	bank	account	and	have
received	your	funds.	You	can	now	buy	gold	tokens.
4.
You	log	in	again	and	click	‘buy’	for	1	oz	of	gold	at	$1,500	per	oz.
5.
The	money	in	your	Goldchain	account	drops	by	$1,500,	and	you	see
you	have	1	‘GoldchainOz’	token	in	your	account.	In	the	background,
Goldchain	reclassifies	1	oz	of	gold	in	its	books	from	‘Gold	owned	by
Goldchain	Inc’	to	‘Customer	assets’.	Goldchain	has	sold	some	gold	to
you,	but	instead	of	shipping	the	physical	gold	to	your	home	it	has
issued	you	a	token	representing	that	gold.	The	gold	token	is	still
under	the	control	of	Goldchain	Inc	because	you	haven’t	yet
withdrawn	it	to	a	wallet	entirely	under	your	control.
6.
If	you	wish	to	have	the	gold	token	completely	under	your	control,
you	can	withdraw	the	GoldchainOz	token	to	your	independent
address.	Goldchain	will	send	a	transaction	to	the	blockchain
transferring	one	GoldchainOz	token	from	their	address	to	your
address.
7.
You	can	keep	the	token,	give	it	to	your	friends,	sell	it,	or	do	whatever
you	want	with	it.	Let’s	say	you	transfer	it	to	Alice.

Eventually	Alice	wants	to	redeem	the	token	real	gold,	if	that	is	an
option,	or	sell	it	for	USD.	She	can	do	so	by	creating	an	account	at
Goldchain	Inc,	transferring	the	gold	token	from	her	blockchain
address	to	their	blockchain	address,	and	requesting	delivery	of	gold,
or	selling	the	token	back	to	Goldchain	Inc,	assuming	these	options
are	available.
If	Goldchain	Inc,	who	controls	the	warehouse,	is	a	central	point	of	failure
and	control,	what	is	the	value	in	using	tokens?	Why	doesn’t	Goldchain
Inc	just	use	an	Excel	spreadsheet?
Firstly,	the	use	of	cryptography	in	blockchain	technology	makes	the
tokens	very	hard	to	fake,	and	this	creates	more	transparency	over	the
number	of	tokens	issued	and	held	by	customers.	The	warehouse	can
number	of	tokens	issued	and	held	by	customers.	The	warehouse	can
prove	that	there	are	not	more	tokens	than	they	have	gold	in	their	vault.
An	auditor	would	periodically	match	the	amount	of	physical	gold	to	the
number	of	tokens	outstanding.
Secondly,	existing	processes	of	passing	title	documents	or	receipts	may	be
manual,	time	consuming	or	operationally	challenging.	Transfer	of	digital
tokens	may	be	more	efficient,	and	increasingly	so	as	new	software	and
hardware	is	developed	to	manage	digital	assets.
Finally,	in	a	peer-to-peer	system,	the	warehouse	itself	doesn’t	have	to	be
online	and	participate	in	transactions	between	customers.	All	it	has	to	do
is	issue	and	redeem	the	digital	tokens.	The	trading	of	the	tokens	can
occur	on	whatever	digital	asset	exchange	or	exchanges	are	chosen	rather
than	being	managed	centrally	by	the	warehouse.	The	settlement	of	the
tokens	is	recorded	on	the	chosen	blockchain.
This	leads	to	a	segregation	of	responsibilities	and	opens	up	the	possibility
of	competition	for	each	element	of	the	end	to	end	‘trade	lifecycle’.	The
warehouse’s	job	is	to	store	gold,	issue	tokens	representing	that	gold,	and
transfer	gold	to	any	party	legitimately	redeeming	the	token,	as	it	would
have	done	under	a	paper-based	system	of	old.	Trading,	settlement,
liquidity,	collateralisation,	and	other	functions	unrelated	to	storage	can
be	done	elsewhere	without	the	warehouse	having	to	update	their	records
or	manage	those	functions.	The	title	documents	or	receipts,	by	virtue	of
being	on	a	blockchain,	can	be	trusted	as	genuine	and	uncounterfeitable,
and	the	ownership	or	liens	on	any	particular	lump	of	gold	can	be	made
more	transparent,	potentially	reducing	the	confusion	relating	to	who	has
what	claim	on	which	piece	of	gold.
Asset	backed	tokens	are	easy	to	transfer.	Blockchains	enable	predictable
and	secure	record	keeping.	The	key	risk	is	that	the	issuer	must	remain
solvent.	If	the	gold	is	stolen	from	the	vault,	or	if	the	issuer	becomes
solvent.	If	the	gold	is	stolen	from	the	vault,	or	if	the	issuer	becomes
bankrupt,	whether	from	fraud	or	otherwise,	asset	backed	tokens	can
become	valueless.
Contract Tokens
Contract	tokens	represent	a	contractual	obligation	between	the	issuer	of
the	token	and	the	bearer	of	the	token,	or	between	two	parties	who	jointly
agree	to	hold	the	token.	For	example,	a	token	could	represent	a	share	of	a
company	or	an	interest	rate	swap	between	two	parties.	Shares	can	be
issued	by	a	company	in	the	form	of	a	token,	and	the	owner	of	the	token	is
the	shareholder.	Two	parties	who	agree	on	an	interest	rate	swap	enter
into	an	agreement	which	is	represented	by	the	token.
Contract	tokens	are	slightly	different	from	depository	receipts.	In	the	case
of	a	contract	token,	the	token	
is
	the	share;	whereas	with	a	depository
receipt,	the	token	is	a	
claim	on	a	custodian
	who	is	safekeeping	the	share.
Utility Tokens
The	holder	of	a	utility	token	can	redeem	the	token	from	a	specific	entity
for	a	
product	or	service
	rather	than	for	an	
asset
.	Sale	of	utility	tokens	is	a
popular	ICO	strategy.
Utility	tokens	represent	a	liability	of	the	issuing	company.	Eventually,
when	the	product	or	service	becomes	available,	a	token	holder	can
redeem	their	token	for	that	product	or	service.	In	this	respect,	ICOs	that
issue	utility	tokens	are	performing	a	pre-sale.
Transactions
A	transaction	is	just	an	entry	to	the	ledger	that	changes	the	state	of	the
ledger.	We	have	previously	discussed	transactions	that	change	the
ownership	of	tokens.	But	transactions	can	also	represent	changes	to	the
ownership	of	tokens.	But	transactions	can	also	represent	changes	to	the
token	itself,	if	allowed	by	the	rules	for	that	particular	token.	For	example,
a	token	representing	a	share	could	change	status	from	‘pre-dividend’	to
‘ex-dividend,’	if	signed	by	the	right	participant	and	a	dividend	is	paid.
That	same	token	could	be	marked	with	‘voted’	after	a	shareholder	vote
has	taken	place.	A	token	representing	a	bond	could	change	status	from
‘coupon	due’	to	‘coupon	paid’	if	accompanied	by	a	transaction	that	pays
the	coupon.	A	utility	token	representing	a	service	could	be	marked	as
‘partially	redeemed’	if	the	service	had	a	number	of	elements	to	it.	And	so
on.	At	this	stage	in	the	evolution	of	cryptoassets,	we	are	just	scratching
the	surface	of	what	is	possible.
TRACKING OF PHYSICAL OBJECTS
Blockchains	and	distributed	ledgers	work	best	when	everything	can	be
recorded	on	the	chain,	
i.e.
	when	everything	is	digital.	So	blockchains	are
great	for	cryptocurrencies	or	for	tokens	representing	legal	agreements
between	entities,	whether	shares,	bonds,	debt,	or	even	a	future	claim	on
an	entity.	These	tokens	can	be	recorded	digitally	without	any	physical
object	being	present.	But	problems	start	emerging	when	you	want	to
track	physical	objects	such	as	handbags,	food,	art,	or	elephants.
The	interest	in	digital	tokens	for	tracking	ownership	of	physical	objects
seems	to	have	come	from	the	fact	that	bitcoins	are	traceable.	This	is	true
in	a	narrow	sense.	You	can	trace	the	provenance	of	any	specific	bitcoins
through	all	of	the	previous	addresses	that	they	belonged	to,	all	the	way
back	to	where	they	were	first	mined.	This	is	possible	because	every
transaction	is	recorded	on	the	Bitcoin	blockchain,	and	anyone	can
download	the	full	blockchain	and	interrogate	it.	The	provenance	of
bitcoins	is	traceable	because	that	is	the	way	Bitcoin	works.	You	can’t
make	a	Bitcoin	transaction	
off
	the	chain,	because	the	very	definition	of	a
Bitcoin	transaction	is	that	it	is	recorded	
on
	the	chain,	and	the	UTxO
model	forces	you	to	specify	which	bitcoins	are	moving	where,	resulting	in
a	complete	chain	of	provenance	on	the	chain.
Can	we	extend	that	concept	easily	to	real	world	objects?	According	to	an
article	published	online	by	
Fortune
	in	October	2016,	‘Walmart	and	IBM
Are	Partnering	to	Put	Chinese	Pork	on	a	Blockchain’
195
.	Apparently,
blockchains	may	be	used	to	track	the	provenance	of	pork	and	to	stop
potentially	dangerous	food	from	getting	to	consumers.
But	stop	for	a	second	and	think.	How	on	earth	would	this	work?	I	don’t
know	much	about	the	pig	supply	chain	but	I	suppose	you	have	a	bunch	of
companies	who	do	everything	from	breeding	the	piglets,	feeding	them,
companies	who	do	everything	from	breeding	the	piglets,	feeding	them,
slaughtering	them,	cutting	them	up,	shipping	them,	packing,	and
delivering.	Eventually,	pork	cutlets	end	up	on	the	supermarket	shelf	for
people	to	buy	or	on	a	plate	in	a	restaurant.	So…	all	the	participants	in	the
pig	supply	chain	could	have	an	address	on	a	blockchain,	with	PigCoin
tokens,	issued	presumably	by	the	farmer,	that	represent	pigs.	Movement
of	PigCoin	is	recorded	immutably	on	PigChain.	When	a	farmer	sells	a	pig
to	another	farmer,	the	seller	says,	‘Hey,	what’s	your	PigChain	address?
Let	me	send	you	some	PigCoins,’	and	makes	a	corresponding	PigCoin
transaction	on	PigChain	to	represent	the	movement	of	the	pig.	But	then,
one	fateful	day,	the	buyer	is	a	slaughterhouse	who	chops	the	pigs	up	into
small	bits	and	sends	those	different	bits	to	different	parties.	Ah!	But	of
course	a	PigCoin,	like	Bitcoin,	is	divisible,	so	the	slaughterhouse	splits	up
a	PigCoin	and	sends	fractions	to	different	buyers.	But	which	fraction	is
which	part	of	the	pig?	Do	we	need	a	TrotterCoin	and	a
LeftRearFlankCoin?	What	happens	if	one	party	doesn’t	have	an	account
on	PigChain?	What	if	a	party	loses	their	private	key	and	all	of	their
SnoutCoins	end	up	trapped	in	their	account	while	the	real	underlying
snouts	are	being	distributed?	What	if	(horror	of	horrors),	a	bad	person
swaps	out,	in	real	life,	a	high-quality	pig	for	a	low-quality	pig,	but	then
still	sends	the	PigCoin	to	the	buyer,	saying,	‘Oh	look	at	the	PigCoin’s
provenance	on	PigChain,	the	pig	you	are	buying	is	definitely	high	quality,
you	can	download	the	PigChain	and	see	for	yourself?’	And	when	a	pig
becomes	part	of	a	sausage,	then	how	would	that	work?	We	will	need
BreadcrumbCoin,	HerbCoin,	NastyBitsOfPigCoin	and	a	market	maker	to
exchange	those	for	a	WienerCoin.	And	how	does	the	restaurant	or	person
in	the	supermarket	casually	browsing	the	raw	cutlets	validate	that	the
sausage	in	front	of	them	is	the	real	deal?	Do	they	take	a	photo	of	the
sausage	and	check	it	against	PigChain?	Do	they	scan	a	QR	code	that	takes
them	to	a	website	that	says	in	large	letters,	‘This	is	definitely	a	real
sausage?’	Or	do	they	pull	out	their	handy	DNA	testing	kit	and	track	the
sausage?’	Or	do	they	pull	out	their	handy	DNA	testing	kit	and	track	the
sausage’s	DNA	on	PigChain?	How	do	you	stop	an	enterprising	chef	from
swapping	out	the	high-quality	cutlet	for	a	cheaper	one?	This	is	all	absurd.
According	to	the	
Fortune
	article,	‘Information	to	be	stored	on	the
blockchain,	where	fraud	and	inaccuracies	are	much	harder	to	get	away
with,	includes	details	related	to	farm	origins,	factory	data,	expiration
dates,	storage	temperatures,	and	shipping’.	That	is	good	then.	Of	course
none	of	that	can	be	faked	before	storing	it	on	PigChain.
It	is	easy	to	make	fun,	but	tracking	real	world	items	by	using	a	digital
overlay	is	difficult.	Blockchains	are	great	for	tracking	unique	digital	items
that	only	exist	on	that	blockchain,	but	not	as	good	when	digital	and
physical	worlds	collide.	Blockchains	don’t	tell	the	truth;	they	just	record
what	someone	tells	them.	Perhaps	blockchains	could	increase	certain
aspects	of	transparency	in	a	supply	chain,	but	they	are	not	foolproof	and
should	not	be	used	just	because	the	phrase	‘supply	chain’	has	the	word
‘chain’	in	it.
Having	said	that,	I	can	imagine	a	few	cases	which	are	interesting	and,
while	not	absolutely	requiring	blockchains,	could	use	some	of	the	same
concepts.	High	value	designer	handbags	could	have	tamper-resistant
chips	inserted;	a	buyer	could	then	scan	a	bag	to	make	sure	that	it	is	not	a
fake	before	buying	it.	The	chip	would	contain	a	private	key	that	would
produce	a	digital	signature	when	scanned.	The	digital	signature	could	be
validated	against	a	list	of	public	keys	issued	by	the	manufacturer.	The
chip	would	be	embedded	in	the	handbag	such	that	it	is	obvious	if	it	is
removed	or	tampered	with.
This	system	uses	public	and	private	keys	but	doesn’t	need	blockchains.
The	system	would	solve	the	issue	of	a	bad	actor	passing	off	a	fake
handbag	as	real.	However,	many	people	buy	fake	designer	handbags
knowing	that	they	are	fake…they	buy	them	because	they	look	like	the	real
knowing	that	they	are	fake…they	buy	them	because	they	look	like	the	real
thing	but	are	cheap.	So	the	system	would	only	go	so	far.	It	is	important	to
deeply	understand	the	fundamental	problem	being	solved.
NOTABLE CRYPTOCURRENCIES AND
TOKENS
There	are	many	other	cryptocurrencies	that	either	exist	as	blockchains	in
themselves	or	as	tokens	recorded	in	smart	contracts	on	other
blockchains,	usually	on	Ethereum’s	public	chain.
Onchainfx.com	and	coinmarketcap.com	do	a	good	job	in	cataloguing
these	if	they	trade	over	a	certain	amount	of	volume	per	day.	At	time	of
writing,	onchainfx
196
	records	the	top
197
	tokens,	with	my	comments,	as
follows:	
Currency	tokens
	(Primarily	used	as	Money/Store	of	Value):

•
Ripple	(XRP)—a	token	used	to	move	value	across	the	Ripple
network,	designed	as	a	currency	that	was	initially	described	to

exchange	and	international	payments.	Created	in	2012	by	OpenCoin
(rebranded	to	Ripple	Inc	in	2015
198
).

signatures	to	obscure	payer	and	recipient	addresses.	Launched	in
2014.
Platform	tokens
	(i.e.	those	used	as	gas	to	power	smart	contracts):

scalable	than	Ethereum.
Utility	tokens
	(Built	for	Specific-Use	Networks)
•
Augur	(REP)—a	token	used	for	betting	on	things	on	a	‘prediction

media	and	forum	sites.	Launched	in	2016.
This	is	just	a	short	list	of	the	many	tokens	and	platforms	that	exist	today.
Many	more	are	planned.	The	blockchain	and	cryptoasset	industry	in
aggregate	has	attracted	significant	interest	and	investment,	and	I	would
guess	that	tens	of	thousands	of	developers	are	working	to	build	viable
platforms.	As	with	businesses,	I	expect	that	most	platforms	will	evolve
and	adapt,	in	search	of	long	term	viability.	I	expect	a	few	to	succeed	and
many	to	fail	due	to	unviable	models,	insufficient	interest,	or	insufficient
network	size.	Those	that	succeed	could	become	as	relevant	to	people	as
the	internet	is	today.


Part 6
BLOCKCHAIN
	
TECHNOLOGY
WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
You	will	see	the	phrase	‘blockchain	technology,’	or	commonly	just
‘blockchain,’	in	many	different	contexts,	and	it	can	be	confusing	because
different	people	use	the	words	to	mean	different	things.	Purists	will	have
a	different	understanding	of	the	word	from	generalists.	Angela	Walch,
Research	Fellow	at	University	College	London—Centre	for	Blockchain
Technologies,	provides	some	excellent	commentary	on	the	lexicon	in	her
2017	paper	‘The	Path	of	the	Blockchain	Lexicon	(and	the	Law)’.
199
	In
general,	technologists	and	computer	scientists	are	more	precise	with	their
terminology	than	journalists,	who	write	for	the	layman.	In	this	chapter,	I
will	provide	a	broad	overview	of	blockchain	technology	and	then	explain
some	of	the	nuances.
By	now,	you	should	understand	that	there	is	no	such	thing	as	‘the
blockchain,’	just	as	there	is	no	such	thing	as	‘the	database’	or	‘the
network’.	ETH	is	
the
	Ethereum	blockchain,	a	reference	to	the	public
Ethereum	transaction	database—but	you	can	also	create	private
Ethereum	blockchains	by	simply	running	some	node	software	on	some
machines	and	having	them	connect	to	each	other.	Your	private	Ethereum
network	will	create	its	own	blockchain,	and	the	miners	will	mine	ETH
just	like	in	the	public	network.	Your	private	ETH	will	not	be	compatible
with	the	public	ETH	because	your	private	Ethereum	network	has	a
different	history	from	the	public	version.
In	print,	if	you	read	‘the	blockchain,’	you	may	need	to	make	a	guess	as	to
what	the	writer	means.	In	conversation,	and	at	the	risk	of	coming	across
as	pedantic,	it	should	help	your	understanding	to	ask	early	on,	‘Which
blockchain	platform?’	then,	‘The	public	chain	or	a	private	one?’	As	you
now	know,	there	are	many	blockchains,	and	many	variations	on	how	they
work.
work.
If	you	like	hierarchies,	blockchains	fall	under	the	broader	category	of
‘distributed	ledgers’.	All	blockchains	are	distributed	ledgers,	but	you	can
have	distributed	ledgers	that	don’t	have	blocks	of	data	chained	together
and	broadcast	to	all	participants.	Sometimes	journalists	and	consultants
inaccurately	use	the	term	‘blockchain’	when	they	are	describing	non-
blockchain	distributed	ledgers.	I	guess	‘distributed	ledgers’	is	too	much	of
a	mouthful	whereas	‘blockchain’	is	a	nice	memorable	buzzword.
We	need	to	differentiate	between	blockchain	
technologies
	and	specific
blockchain	
ledgers
.
Blockchain	
technologies
	are	the	rules	or	standards	for	how	a	ledger	is
created	and	maintained.	Different	technologies	have	different	rules	for
participation,	different	network	rules,	different	specifications	for	how	to
create	transactions,	different	methods	of	storing	data,	and	different
consensus	mechanisms.	When	a	network	is	created,	the	blockchain	or
ledger	of	record	is	initially	empty	of	transactions,	just	as	a	new	physical
leather-bound	ledger	is	empty.	Some	example	blockchain	technologies
are:	Bitcoin,	Ethereum,	NXT,	Corda,	Fabric,	and	Quorum.
Blockchain	
ledgers
	themselves	are	specific	instances	of	ledgers	that
contain	their	respective	transactions	or	records.
Think	of	normal	databases.	You	may	have	heard	of	a	few	types	or	flavours
of	databases—Oracle	databases,	MySQL	databases,	perhaps	others.	Each
flavour	works	slightly	differently	though	they	are	all	have	similar	goals:
efficient	storage,	sorting,	and	retrieval	of	data.	You	can	have	multiple
instances
	of	the	same	type	of	database:	a	company	might	use	more	than
one	Oracle	database.	And	so	it	is	with	blockchains.	Some	blockchain
technologies	operate	one	way,	others	operate	a	slightly	different	way	and
you	can	have	multiple	instances	of	any	blockchain	technology,	in	separate
ledgers.
Public,	Permissionless
	
Blockchains
We’ve	explored	that	cryptocurrencies	and	some	other	tokens	use	public
blockchains	as	their	medium	of	record—that	is,	their	respective
transactions	are	recorded	in	blocks	on	a	replicated	ledger.	Public
blockchains	are	also	described	as	permissionless	primarily	because
anyone	may	create	blocks	or	be	a	bookkeeper	without	needing	permission
from	an	authority.	In	these	public	networks,	there	is	also
permissionlessness	in	another	sense—anyone	may	create	an	address	for
receiving	funds	and	create	transactions	for	sending	funds.
Private	Instances	of	Public
	
Blockchains
As	described	earlier,	you	can	run	blockchain	software	on	a	private
network	to	create	a	fresh	ledger.	For	example,	you	could	take	the
Ethereum	code	and	run	it,	but	instead	of	pointing	your	node	to	some
computers	already	running	the	public	Ethereum	blockchain,	you	could
point	it	instead	to	a	few	other	computers	that	are	not	on	the	public
Ethereum	network.	As	far	as	all	of	these	computers	are	concerned,	they
are	starting	with	a	fresh	ledger	with	no	entries.
Could	you	set	up	a	small	private	network	running	Ethereum,	then	mine
some	ETH	and	transfer	them	to	the	public	network?	No.	Although	this
private	network	would	use	the	same	set	of	
rules
	as	the	public	blockchain,
they	have	different	records	of	account	balances.	Nodes	on	each	network
can	only	validate	what	they	see	in	their	own	blockchain,	and	they	are	not
able	to	see	coins	on	the	other	blockchain.
Permissioned	(or	permissionable)	blockchains
Some	platforms	are	designed	to	allow	groups	of	participants	to	create
Some	platforms	are	designed	to	allow	groups	of	participants	to	create
their	own	blockchains	in	a	private	context.	They	do	not	have	a	global
public	network.	These	are	called	‘private	blockchains’	and	they	are
designed	to	only	allow	pre-approved	participants	to	participate.	Hence
the	term	‘permissioned’.
Popular	permissioned	blockchains	include:
•
Corda,	a	platform	built	from	scratch	by	R3	and	a	consortium	of
banks	for	use	by	regulated	financial	institutions	but	with	broad
applicability.
•
Hyperledger	Fabric,	a	platform	built	by	IBM	and	donated	to	the
Linux	Foundation’s	Hyperledger	Project.	It	was	originally	based

Various	private	instances	of	Ethereum	under	development	by
individual	businesses.
Unlike	permissionless	networks	such	as	Bitcoin	and	Ethereum,
permissioned	blockchains	don’t	need	their	own	native	token.	They	don’t
need	to	incentivise	block-creators,	and	they	don’t	need	proof-of-work	as
the	gating	factor	to	allow	participants	to	write	to	the	shared	ledger.
Instead,	when	businesses	transact,	they	are	looking	for	data	that	can	be
trusted	to	be	up	to	date,	agreed	and	signed	off	by	the	appropriate	parties.
In	a	traditional	business	ecosystem,	participants	are	all	identified,	and	if
some	try	to	misbehave	they	can	be	sued.	When	parties	are	identified	and
have	legal	agreements	between	them,	the	technical	environment	is	not	as
have	legal	agreements	between	them,	the	technical	environment	is	not	as
hostile	as	that	of	the	pseudonymous	world	of	public	cryptocurrency
blockchains,	where	code	is	law	and	there	are	no	terms	of	service	or	legal
agreements.
Some	cryptocurrency	proponents	argue	that	permissioned	private
blockchains	are	somehow	inferior	to	public	cryptocurrency	blockchains.
An	analogy	commonly	used	is	that	public	cryptocurrency	blockchains	are
like	‘the	internet,’	in	that	they	are	open,	free,	and	permissionless,	whereas
private	industry	blockchains	are	like	intranets,	which	are	closed.	The
implication	here,	of	course,	is	that	public	blockchains	will	be	very
successful	and	disruptive	whereas	private	blockchains	are	boring,
unsuccessful	and	not	very	disruptive	or	game	changing
200
.
Nothing	could	be	further	from	the	truth.	Intranets	and	private	company
networks	are	highly	successful.	I	can’t	think	of	any	significant	company
that	doesn’t	use	its	own	network.	And	it	is	equally	far	from	the	truth	to
regard	the	internet	as	being	open	and	permissionless.	As	Tim	Swanson
notes	on	his	blog	in	‘Intranets	and	the	internet’
201
:
The internet is actually a bunch of private networks of internet service providers (ISPs) that
have legal agreements with the end users, cooperate through ‘peering’ agreements with
other ISPs, and communicate via a common, standardized routing protocols such as BGP
which publishes autonomous system numbers.
The	fact	is	that	cryptocurrencies	and	private	blockchains	are	different
tools	deployed	to	address	different	problems.	They	are	both	fine	and	may
happily	coexist.	In	news	articles	written	between	2015	and	2018,
blockchain	technology	was	commonly	defined	as	‘the	technology
underpinning	the	cryptocurrency	Bitcoin’.	This	conflates	the	two	ideas
and	is	as	enlightening	as	defining	databases	as	‘the	technology	that
powers	Twitter’.
Public	and	private	blockchains	run	within	different	context	and
ecosystems	and,	as	discussed,	are	designed	to	address	different	problems.
ecosystems	and,	as	discussed,	are	designed	to	address	different	problems.
So	they	will	naturally	operate	in	different	ways.	After	all,	technology	is	a
tool,	and	tools	exist	to	serve	a	need.	If	the	needs	are	different,	then	it	is
likely	that	the	tools	will	be	different.
WHAT IS COMMON TO BLOCKCHAIN
TECHNOLOGIES?
Blockchains	usually	contain	the	following	concepts:
1.
A	data	store	(database)	that	records	changes	in	the	data.	Up	to	now
they	have	most	commonly	been	financial	transactions,	but	you	can
store	and	record	changes	to	any	kind	of	data	in	a	blockchain.
2.
Replication	of	the	data	store	across	a	number	of	systems	in	real	time.
‘Broadcast’	blockchains,	such	as	Bitcoin	and	Ethereum,	ensure	that
all	data	is	sent	to	all	participants:	everyone	sees	everything.	Other
technologies	are	more	selective	about	where	data	is	sent.
3.
‘Peer-to-peer’	rather	than	client-server	network	architecture.	Data
may	be	‘gossiped’	to	neighbours	rather	than	broadcast	by	a	single
coordinator	acting	as	the	golden	source	of	data.
4.
Cryptographic	methods	such	as	digital	signatures	to	prove
ownership	and	authenticity,	and	hashes	for	references	and
sometimes	to	manage	write-access.
I	often	describe	blockchain	technology	as	‘A	collection	of	technologies,	a
bit	like	a	bag	of	Legos’.	You	can	take	different	bricks	out	of	the	bag	and
put	them	together	in	different	ways	to	create	different	results.
Sometimes	when	discussing	specific	potential	uses	for	this	technology,	we
hear	this	exchange:
‘But,	you	don’t	need	a	
blockchain
	to	do	that.	You	can	just	use	
traditional
technology!’
‘So	how	would	you	do	it?’
‘Oh,	some	data	storage,	some	peer-to-peer	data	sharing,	cryptography	to
ensure	authenticity,	hashes	to	ensure	data	tampering	is	evident	etc’.
‘But	you’ve	just	described	how	blockchains	work!’
So	blockchains	are	not	themselves	a	new	invention,	but	instead,	they	put
So	blockchains	are	not	themselves	a	new	invention,	but	instead,	they	put
together	existing	technologies	to	create	new	capabilities.
What’s	the	difference	between	a	blockchain	and	a
	
database?
A	common	database	is	a	system	which	simply	stores	and	retrieves	data.	A
blockchain	platform	is	more	than	that.	It	stores	and	retrieves	existing
data	just	as	a	normal	database	does.	It	also	connects	to	other	peers	and
listens	for	new	data,	validates	new	data	against	pre-agreed	rules,	then
stores	and	broadcasts	that	new	data	to	other	network	participants	to
ensure	that	they	all	share	the	same	updated	data.	And	it	does	so
constantly,	without	manual	intervention.
What’s	the	difference	between	a	distributed	database	and	a
distributed
	
ledger?
Replicated
	databases,	where	data	is	copied	in	real	time	to	multiple
machines	for	resiliency	or	performance	reasons	are	not	new.	
Sharded
databases,	where	the	workload	and	storage	are	sharded,	or	spread	around
multiple	machines,	usually	to	increase	speed	and	storage,	are	also	not
new.	With	distributed	ledgers	or	blockchains,	however,	participants	do
not	need	to	trust	each	other.	They	do	not	work	on	the	assumption	that	the
other	participants	are	behaving	honestly,	so	each	participant	individually
checks	everything.	Richard	Brown	describes	this	in	his	blog
202
	as	a
difference	in	trust	boundaries:

WHAT ARE BLOCKCHAINS GOOD FOR?
The	motivations	between	public	and	private	blockchains	are	different.
Let’s	consider	them	separately.
Public Blockchains
To	date,	public	blockchains	have	been	used	with	some	success	in	the
following	areas:
1.
Speculation
2.
Darknet	markets
3.
Cross	border	payments
4.
Initial	Coin	Offerings
Speculation
The	main	use	for	cryptocurrencies	is	undoubtedly	speculation.	Their
prices	are	volatile	and	people	make	and	lose	a	lot	of	money	trading	these
coins.
The	fact	that	there	are	no	established	methods	to	value	a	cryptocurrency
means	that	prices	are	likely	to	remain	volatile	for	some	time.	This	differs
from	traditional	financial	markets	where	pricing	models	help	to	constrain
prices	to	within	broadly	understood	limits.	Equities	have	well-established
pricing	methodologies.	Discounted	forecast	cashflows,	book	value,	and
enterprise	value	calculations	can	help	to	establish	a	consensus	on	the
value	of	a	company.	Ratios	such	as	earnings	per	share,	price	to	earnings,
and	return	on	assets	can	help	to	compare	share	prices	between	similar
companies.	Fiat	currencies	trade	on	the	basis	of	comparative	economic
data.	Other	traditional	financial	assets	have	other	standardised	pricing
methodologies.	Up	to	now,	however,	I	have	not	seen	credible	methods	for
pricing	cryptocurrencies	or	ICO	tokens.	This	is	changing—as	the	industry
pricing	cryptocurrencies	or	ICO	tokens.	This	is	changing—as	the	industry
matures,	pricing	models	are	being	explored,	but	it	will	take	some	time	for
these	models	to	become	widely	accepted.
Darknet Markets
Cryptocurrencies	have	been	used	with	some	success	to	buy	items	from
underground	marketplaces.
Unfortunately	for	some,	the	traceability	of	certain	cryptocurrencies
makes	them	flawed	candidates	for	illegal	activity.	In	2015,	two	US	Federal
Agents	from	the	Drug	Enforcement	Agency	(DEA)	and	the	US	Secret
Service,	sought	to	enrich	themselves	while	conducting	an	undercover
investigation	of	the	Silk	Road	drug	marketplace.	Perhaps	they	believed
that	Bitcoin	was	anonymous	and	untraceable.	They	allegedly	stole,
bribed,	blackmailed,	and	laundered	the	proceeds	while	under	cover	and
were	eventually	charged	with	money	laundering	and	wire	fraud.	Here	is
an	excerpt	from	a	press	release	issued	by	the	US	Department	of	Justice
203
:
Carl M. Force, 46, of Baltimore, was a Special Agent with the DEA, and Shaun W. Bridges, 32,
of Laurel, Maryland, was a Special Agent with the U.S. Secret Service (USSS). Both were
assigned to the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force, which investigated illegal activity in the Silk
Road marketplace. Force served as an undercover agent and was tasked with establishing
communications with a target of the investigation, Ross Ulbricht, a.k.a. ‘Dread Pirate
Roberts’. Force is charged with wire fraud, theft of government property, money laundering
and conflict of interest. Bridges is charged with wire fraud and money laundering.
According to the complaint, Force was a DEA agent assigned to investigate the Silk Road
marketplace. During the investigation, Force engaged in certain authorized undercover
operations by, among other things, communicating online with ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’
(Ulbricht), the target of his investigation. The complaint alleges, however, that Force then,
without authority, developed additional online personas and engaged in a broad range of
illegal activities calculated to bring him personal financial gain. In doing so, the complaint
alleges, Force used fake online personas, and engaged in complex Bitcoin transactions to steal
from the government and the targets of the investigation. Specifically, Force allegedly
solicited and received digital currency as part of the investigation, but failed to report his
receipt of the funds, and instead transferred the currency to his personal account. In one such
transaction, Force allegedly sold information about the government’s investigation to the
target of the investigation. The complaint also alleges that Force invested in and worked for a
target of the investigation. The complaint also alleges that Force invested in and worked for a
digital currency exchange company while still working for the DEA, and that he directed the
company to freeze a customer’s account with no legal basis to do so, then transferred the
customer’s funds to his personal account. Further, Force allegedly sent an unauthorized
Justice Department subpoena to an online payment service directing that it unfreeze his
personal account.
Bridges allegedly diverted to his personal account over $800,000 in digital currency that he
gained control of during the Silk Road investigation. The complaint alleges that Bridges
placed the assets into an account at Mt. Gox, the now-defunct digital currency exchange in
Japan. He then allegedly wired funds into one of his personal investment accounts in the
United States mere days before he sought a $2.1 million seizure warrant for Mt. Gox’s
accounts.
On	1	July	2015,	Force	pled	guilty	to	money	laundering	with	predicates	of
wire	fraud	and	theft	of	government	property,	obstruction	of	justice,	and
extortion.	Later,	on	31	August	2015,	Bridges	admitted	that	he	stole	over
$800,000	of	Bitcoin	while	on	the	case,	and	pled	guilty	to	money
laundering	and	obstruction	of	justice
204
What	can	we	learn	from	this?	Don’t	use	bitcoins	to	perform	or	fund	illegal
activities.
Cross Border Payments
While	there	may	have	been	some	limited	success	in	using
cryptocurrencies	as	a	vehicle	to	move	fiat	across	borders,	adoption	has
been	limited.	I	personally	performed	an	experiment	in	2014	when	I	sent
$200	Singapore	dollars	to	my	friend	in	Indonesia
205
	using	three	methods:
Western	Union,	bank	transfer,	and	Bitcoin.	The	Bitcoin	route	was	by	far
the	worst	user	experience,	and	the	most	expensive.	However,	Bitcoin	has
become	more	usable	since	then,	and	I	expect	it	to	continue	to	improve
further.
The	core	problem	is	that	in	a	conventional	fiat-to-fiat	remittance,
whether	through	a	financial	services	agency	such	as	Western	Union	or
through	the	banking	system,	there	is	only	one	exchange	of	currencies.
through	the	banking	system,	there	is	only	one	exchange	of	currencies.
Using	cryptocurrencies,	there	are	now	two	exchanges:	fiat	to	crypto,	then
crypto	to	fiat.	More	exchanges	mean	more	steps,	complexity,	and	cost.
Cross	border	payments	were	initially	trumpeted	as	a	‘killer	app’	for
Bitcoin	and	cryptocurrencies,	especially	in	2014–15,	but	in	2018	there	is
less	media	attention	for	this	particular	use	of	cryptocurrency.	Indeed,	in
June	2018,	money	transfer	agency	Western	Union	announced	that	they
had	been	testing	XRP	for	six	months	and	were	yet	to	see	any	savings
206
.
Perhaps	the	industry	is	in	the	‘trough	of	disillusionment’	in	Gartner’s
technology	hype	cycle
207
.
Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)
ICOs	are	a	new	method	of	fundraising	that	became	popular	in	2016.
Companies	offer	tokens	to	people	in	return	for	cryptocurrency.	Tokens
usually	represent	a	claim	on	future	goods	or	services	provided	by	that
company.	We	discuss	ICOs	in	more	detail	in	the	next	section.
Other
Some	merchants	use	cryptocurrency	payment	processors	to	accept
cryptocurrencies	from	customers	as	payment.	In	2014	and	2015,	it	was	a
cheap	way	for	merchants	to	get	press	releases	and	seem	innovative.
However,	since	then	many	have	quietly	removed	this	payment
mechanism	due	to	lack	of	customer	interest.
I	have	seen	public	blockchains	being	used	for	other	‘fringe’	purposes,	for
example	the	storing	of	hashes	on	a	blockchain	to	prove	that	some	data
existed	at	a	certain	point	in	time.	I	haven’t	seen	evidence	that	this	use	is
particularly	widespread.
Critics	of	cryptocurrencies	often	claim	that	they	are	widely	used	for
money	laundering.	While	there	is	undoubtedly	some	laundering	of	illicit
funds	using	cryptocurrencies,	as	there	is	using	fiat	currencies,	it	is	hard	to
tell	at	this	stage	what	proportion	of	cryptocurrency	transactions	are	used
for	this	purpose,	and	what	proportion	of	global	money	laundering	is
performed	through	cryptocurrencies.	For	serious	organised	crime,	I
suspect	that	the	cryptocurrency	markets	are	just	too	small	and	illiquid	to
satisfy	their	demands.	Big	business	enterprises,	high	value	banknotes,
even	banks	still	are	more	likely	to	be	the	preferred	vehicles	for	most
money	laundering.
Private Blockchains
While	public	blockchains	have	enabled	censorship	resistant	digital	cash,
they	were	not	designed	to	solve	problems	that	traditional	businesses
have.	What	are	the	challenges	within	existing	businesses,	and	how	might
concepts	borrowed	from	public	blockchains	help	improve	how	they
operate?
Business-to-business
	
communication
Processes	
within
	an	organisation	have,	over	time,	been	made	efficient	by
use	of	internal	systems,	workflow	tools,	intranets,	and	data	repositories.
However,	the	sophistication	of	technology	used	to	communicate	
between
organisations	has	remained	low.	In	some	advanced	situations,	APIs
(application	programming	interfaces)	are	used	for	machine	to	machine
communications,	but	in	the	majority	of	cases	we	rely	on	emails	and	pdf
files.	It	is	still	common	for	pieces	of	paper	with	wet-ink	signatures	to	be
couriered	across	the	world.
Duplicative	data,	processes,	and
	
reconciliation
Businesses	trust	their	own	data	but	not	anyone	else’s.	This	means	that
businesses	within	an	ecosystem	duplicate	data	and	processes.	Digital	files
businesses	within	an	ecosystem	duplicate	data	and	processes.	Digital	files
and	records	are	often	replicated	within	and	between	multiple
organisations,	with	none	of	them	being	the	golden	source.	Version
control	of	documents	and	records	is	painful	unless	a	third	party	is	paid	to
be	the	golden	source.	Reconciliation	only	goes	some	way	to	solve	these
pain	points.
Consider	a	digital	invoice	issued	by	company	A	to	company	B.	The
invoice	could	be	a	pdf	file	which	is	created	by	someone	at	company	A,
perhaps	signed	off	by	someone	else	in	company	A	before	a	copy	is	sent
from	the	accounts	receivable	department	to	someone	at	company	B.
Someone	at	company	B	receives	it	in	their	inbox,	saves	a	copy	on	their
hard	drive,	and	forwards	a	copy	to	someone	else,	perhaps	their	manager,
to	sign	off.	Another	copy	goes	to	the	accounts	payable	department	and,
when	the	invoice	is	paid,	everyone	needs	to	be	updated.	There	could	be
ten	or	more	copies	of	the	same	asset—the	invoice—floating	around
various	computers,	none	of	which	are	kept	in	sync.	When	the	state	of	the
invoice	changes	from	‘unpaid’	to	‘paid,’	this	is	not	reflected	on	all	of	the
copies	of	the	invoice.
Private
	
blockchains
So	it	is	not	surprising	that	businesses	have	become	interested	in	concepts
popularised	by	public	blockchains	such	as	unique	digital	assets,	trusted
automation,	and	cryptographically	secured	ledger	entries.	However,	the
radical	transparency	of	public	blockchains	is	not	attractive	to	businesses
that	quite	legitimately	may	require	a	level	of	commercial	confidentiality.
Private	blockchains	have	been	inspired	by	public	blockchains	but	are
being	designed	to	meet	the	needs	of	business.	They	adopt	some	concepts
from	public	blockchains	and	reject	others.	By	relaxing	the	strict
requirements	of	public	blockchains	around	permissionlessness	and
censorship	resistance,	private	blockchains	do	not	need	mechanisms	such
censorship	resistance,	private	blockchains	do	not	need	mechanisms	such
as	the	energy-intensive	proof-of-work	mining.
Some	technology	inspired	by	public	blockchains	do	not	have	blocks	in
chains	at	all!	They	are	sometimes	more	accurately	called	‘distributed
ledgers’.	Corda,	a	distributed	ledger	platform	built	by	R3	and	a	group	of
banks,	is	an	open	source	platform	that	uses	many	of	the	concepts	from
public	blockchains,	but	it	doesn’t	bundle	transactions	up	into	blocks	for
batch	processing	and	distribution	across	the	whole	network.	This
addresses	some	privacy	concerns	as	only	the	businesses	who	are	involved
in	a	transaction	see	it.
A	key	benefit	of	blockchains	and	other	similar	data	structures	that	use
chains	of	hashes	is	that	parties	have	the	ability	to	know	for	themselves
that	a	set	of	statements	is	complete	(not	missing	any)	and	that	the
statements	themselves	are	complete	and	untampered.	Each	party	can
verify	this	for	themselves	without	having	to	check	with	another	party.
This	is	useful	in	many	business	situations,	not	least	banks	who	need	to
know	that	their	list	of	trades	is	complete	and	the	data	within	the	trades	is
consistent	with	their	counterparty.
Private	blockchains	aim	to	increase	the	quality	and	security	of	technology
used	in	business-to-business	communications.	They	allow	unique	digital
assets	to	move	freely	and	reliably	between	companies	without	the	need	to
have	a	third	party	act	as	a	record	keeper.	Private	blockchains	can	provide
transparent	multilateral	workflows	in	the	form	of	smart	contracts,	and
demonstrate	that	the	agreed	workflows	are	adhered	to.	This	is	what	is
meant	by	‘trustless	automation’.	Instead	of	having	to	trust	a	business	to
perform	as	agreed,	a	smart	contract	ensures	that	pre-programmed
processes	are	followed.
Private	blockchains	may	be	useful	any	time	a	business	interacts	with
another	business	to	share	workflows,	processes,	or	assets.	When	does	this
another	business	to	share	workflows,	processes,	or	assets.	When	does	this
happen?	Pretty	much	all	of	the	time!	Most	businesses	don’t	operate	in	a
vacuum;	they	need	to	interact	with	other	businesses.	The	financial
services	industry	was	the	first	to	invest,	to	understand,	and	to	use	this
technology,	specifically	for	wholesale	banking	and	in	financial	markets.
This	makes	sense,	as	the	industry	is	dominated	by	business-to-business
workflows,	intermediaries,	and	digital	assets;	and	the	‘back	office’	had
not	received	significant	investment	in	decades.	Perhaps	the	fact	that
Bitcoin	was	described	as	a	cryptocurrency	also	made	it	interesting	to
banks.
Let’s	revisit	the	invoice	example.	Imagine	now	if	the	invoice	was	recorded
on	some	sort	of	ledger	that	was	kept	in	sync	between	both	companies,
bilaterally,	and	as	soon	as	it	was	approved,	signed,	or	paid,	both	parties
would	know	about	it.	This	could	streamline	many	business	processes,	and
the	concepts	could	be	extended	to	any	document,	record,	or	data.
Of	course,	many	business-to-business	workflows	could	be	digitised	and
automated	if	you	could	find	a	party	to	store	the	data	and	be	the	golden
source.	In	some	cases,	they	are.	SWIFT	and	Bolero	are	examples	that	fit
this	category.	But	in	other	cases,	a	third	party	may	not	be	viable,	either
because	everyone	wants	to	be	it	or	no	one	wants	to	be	it,	or	there	are
regulatory	or	geographical	reasons	preventing	the	emergence	of	such	a
party.	Industries	can	be	suspicious	of	single	points	of	power	and	control,
and	wary	of	the	monopolistic	behaviour	that	often	emerges	from	this.
Central	repositories	of	data	could	have	competitive	implications	if	leaked
or	misused.	So	there	are	a	number	of	reasons	why	an	apparently	obvious
solution	of	having	a	third	party	may	not	be	viable.
Non-financial	industries	are	now	becoming	interested	in	exploring	the
technology	for,	among	other	things,	digital	identity,	supply	chains,	trade
finance,	healthcare,	procurement,	real	estate,	and	asset	registries.
Notable Private Blockchains
Some	private	or	permissioned	blockchains	are	certainly	gaining
mindshare	and	traction.	Current	examples	are:

in	the	financial	services	industry.	It	was	designed	by	a	consortium	of

Corda is an open source enterprise blockchain platform that has been designed and built from
the ground up to enable legal contracts and other shared data to be managed and
synchronised between mutually untrusting organisations in any industry. Uniquely amongst
enterprise blockchain platforms, Corda allows a diverse range of applications to interoperate
on a single global network.
Corda	uses	concepts	drawn	from	Bitcoin	and	public	blockchains	to
guarantee	that	digital	assets	are	unique	and	data	is	synchronised	between
databases	controlled	by	different	parties,	though	it	diverges	from	other
blockchains	in	that	it	does	not	bundle	unrelated	transactions	together
and	distribute	them	to	all	participants	in	a	network	for	periodic
processing.	This	means	it	can	process	higher	transaction	volumes	and
resolves	the	privacy	issue	of	public	blockchains.	Although	Corda	was

Digital	Asset	GSL
Digital	Asset	Holdings,	LLC	is	a	company	founded	in	2014.	According	to
Wikipedia
214
,	it	‘Builds	products	based	on	distributed	ledger	technology
(DLT)	for	regulated	financial	institutions,	such	as	financial	market
infrastructure	providers,	CCPs,	CSDs,	exchanges,	banks,	custodians	and
their	market	participants’.	The	technology	platform	is	called	the	Global
Synchronization	Log	(GSL).
Digital	Asset	has	a	notable	contract	to	use	DLT	to	modernise	and	replace
the	Australian	Stock	Exchange’s	technology	systems
215
.	This	is	regarded	as
a	major	vote	of	confidence	for	Digital	Asset	and	the	entire	private
blockchain	industry.
Hyperledger	Fabric
Hyperledger	Fabric	is	a	blockchain	technology	originally	developed	by
IBM	and	Digital	Asset,	and	incubated	under	the	Linux	Foundation’s
Hyperledger	Project.	It	seems	to	have	some	traction	in	supply	chains	and
healthcare.
JP	Morgan	Quorum
Quorum	is	a	blockchain	technology	originally	created	by	US	bank	JP
Morgan	Chase	and	is	based	on	the	Ethereum	platform.	It	is	interesting
because	it	uses	advanced	cryptographic	techniques	called	
zero	knowledge
proofs
	to	obfuscate	transaction	data.	In	March	2018,	the	
Financial	Times
reported	that	JP	Morgan	was	considering	spinning	off	the	project	into	its
own	entity

BLOCKCHAIN EXPERIMENTS
Many	experiments	using	blockchain	technology	have	been	announced	by
startups	and	incumbents	alike.	Thy	are	often	described	as	‘use-cases,’	a
term	that	implies,	optimistically,	that	a	blockchain	would	be	a	
good	use
for	the	particular	problem	described.	This	selection	of	experiments
collated	by	Peter	Bergstrom
217
	gives	a	flavour	of	the	scope	of	interest	in
blockchain	use:
And	here	is	a	beautiful	infographic	from	Matteo	Gianpietro	Zago
218
:
I	include	these	lists	as	examples	of	the	sharable	but	ultimately	misleading
hype	that	is	propagated	in	the	mainstream	and	social	media.	These	are
not	actual	use	cases.	They	are	experiments	to	apply	blockchain
technology	to	a	variety	of	industries	and	business	workflows,
appropriately	or	not.
Use case for a computer: Door stop
Just	as	you	could	draft	a	letter	using	spreadsheet	software,	you	can	use	a
blockchain	in	almost	any	business	situation	that	involves	data.	After	all,	a
blockchain	is	a	database	with	some	additional	features.	In	my	view,	many
of	these	experiments	will	not	deliver	the	promised	benefits	because	more
appropriate	software	and	tools	are	available.	However,	some	may	succeed
or	evolve	and	get	traction.
It	is	still	unclear	which	processes	will	be	significantly	improved	as	a	direct
consequence	of	the	technology,	and	which	are	improved	simply	by
digitising	the	workflows.
Does	it	matter?	In	many	cases	a	project	might	not	
need
	a	blockchain,	but
using	one	might	trigger	interest	and	management	enthusiasm,	and	even
unlock	a	budget	which	might	not	have	been	available	if	the	project	was
just	a	boring	old	digitisation	project.	This	is	fine,	and	in	this	case,	I	think
the	ends	justify	the	means.	Without	some	amount	of	hype	to	spark	the
imagination	there	would	be	less	money	to	spend	on	innovating,	and
therefore	potentially	less	innovation.
Questions to Ask
With	so	many	attempts	to	use	blockchain	technology,	how	do	you	attempt
to	understand	the	use	and	value	of	blockchain	technology	in	these
experiments?
There	are	certain	questions	that	can	be	useful	to	ask.	Earlier	we	asked,
‘Which	blockchain?’	and,	‘The	public	one	or	a	private	one?’	From	there,
the	questions	depend	on	the	answers	to	the	original	questions.	Here	are	a
few	to	get	started.
For	public	blockchains,	it	is	useful	to	understand:
•
Will	all	parties	run	nodes	or	will	some	trust	others?
•
If	the	blockchain	is	backlogged,	what	impact	might	have	this	have	on
users?
•
How	will	the	project	deal	with	forks	and	chainsplits?
•
How	will	data	privacy	be	achieved?
•
How	will	operators	comply	with	evolving	regulations?
For	private	blockchains,	it	is	useful	to	understand:
•
Who	will	run	the	nodes?	Why?
•
Who	is	going	to	write	blocks?
•
Who	is	going	to	validate	blocks	and	why?
•
If	this	is	about	data	sharing,	why	can’t	a	web	server	be	used?
•
Is	there	a	natural	central	authority	whom	everyone	trusts,	and	if	so
why	aren’t	they	hosting	a	portal?
For	any	type	of	blockchain:
•
What	data	is	represented	on	the	blockchain	and	what	data	is	‘off-
chain?’
•
What	do	the	tokens	represent?
•
When	a	token	is	passed	from	one	party	to	another	what	does	this
mean	in	real	life?
•
What	happens	if	a	private	key	is	lost	or	copied?	Is	this	acceptable?
•
Are	all	parties	comfortable	with	the	data	that	is	being	passed	around
the	network?
•
How	will	upgrades	be	managed?
•
What’s	in	the	blocks?!
219
Depending	on	the	project,	some	of	these	questions	may	be	more	relevant
than	others.	Some	of	the	solutions	may	come	from	network-wide
innovations.	For	example,	public	chains	can	currently	become	congested
but	innovations	such	as	payment	channels	may	enable	much	higher
throughput.	There	are	many	more	questions	to	ask,	depending	on	the
project.
The	point	is	that	you	should	not	take	the	breathless	media
announcements	at	face	value,	but	take	a	more	investigative	approach	to
uncover	if	there	is	value	in	these	experiments	or	not.	At	this	stage	of	the
innovation	cycle,	an	honest	‘I	don’t	know’	is	an	acceptable	answer	for
some	of	these	questions,	and	it	is	more	important	to	understand	the
trade-offs	than	to	immediately	pass	judgment	on	the	solutions.
Part 7
INITIAL COIN
	
OFFERINGS
What Are ICOs?
Initial	Coin	Offerings	(ICOs),	sometimes	called	‘token	sales’	or	‘token
generation	events,’	are	a	new	way	for	companies	to	raise	money	without
diluting	ownership	of	the	company	or	having	to	pay	investors	back.	ICOs
are	a	combination	of	existing	forms	of	fundraising	with	a	few	twists,	and
the	phrase	‘ICO’	seems	to	have	been	coined	(ha)	to	evoke	connotations
with	IPOs	or	Initial	Public	Offerings	of	equities.	According	to	icodata.io,
220
over	11	billion	US	dollars	was	raised	between	2014	and	mid-2018	using
some	form	of	ICO.	Early	ICOs	were	Mastercoin	(July	2013)	and	Maidsafe
(July	2014)	though	they	used	the	term	‘crowd	sale’.	ICOs	became	popular
in	2017.
Traditionally,	a	company	can	raise	money	in	any	of	three	ways:	equity,
debt,	or	through	the	pre-ordering	of	specific	products.	They	can	raise
money	from	a	small	group	of	investors	as	is	typical	in	early	venture
funding,	or	from	a	large	number,	a	style	of	raising	money	typically	called
‘crowdfunding’	that	has	become	increasingly	popular.
In	an	equity	raise,	investors	pay	money	to	the	company	in	return	for	a
share	of	ownership	of	the	company.	Investors	receive	a	share	of	company
profits	in	the	form	of	dividends	and	may	get	voting	rights	at	shareholder
meetings,	among	other	privileges.	In	a	debt	raise,	investors	loan	money	to
the	company	and	may	get	periodic	interest	payments	in	the	form	of
coupons.	Debt	holders	expect	to	get	their	capital	back	at	the	end	of	the
lifetime	of	the	loan.	In	a	pre-fund	or	pre-order,	customers	(note,	they	are
customers,	not	investors)	pay	money	for	a	product	that	they	will	receive
later.	Often	the	product	isn’t	yet	ready	for	distribution.	Sometimes	there
are	discounts	for	ordering	early.
Crowdfunding	is	a	recent	phenomenon	using	the	power	of	the	internet
where	a	project	or	company	can	be	funded	by	raising	small	amounts	of
where	a	project	or	company	can	be	funded	by	raising	small	amounts	of
money	from	large	numbers	of	people,	often	through	a	web	or	app-based
platform	that	brings	together	the	projects	and	the	investors,	or
customers.	All	types	of	funding	can	be	raised	from	the	‘crowd’.	Examples
of	equity	crowdfunding	platforms	are	Seedrs,	AngelList,	CircleUp,	and
Fundable.	Debt	crowdfunding	platforms	include	Prosper,	Lending	Club,
and	Funding	Circle.	Sometimes	these	are	called	‘peer	to	peer	lending’
platforms.	Pre-funding	platforms	include	Kickstarter	and	Indegogo,	and
work	on	pledge	basis,	where	a	project	only	goes	ahead	if	a	certain	target
amount	of	money	is	pledged.	This	is	popular	for	products	that	appeal	to	a
niche.	Pre-ordering	is	popular	for	book	and	computer	game	sales.
Different	ICOs	have	different	characteristics,	and	the	generalisations	I
make	in	this	chapter	serve	to	provide	a	broad	overview,	but	there	will	be
exceptions.	The	industry	is	moving	quickly,	and	regulators	are	starting	to
clarify	their	views	on	this	new	form	of	fundraising.
How Do ICOs work?
Companies
221
	describe	a	particular	product	or	service	in	a	document
called	a	whitepaper	and	announce	their	ICO.	Investors
222
	send	funds,
usually	cryptocurrencies,	to	the	company	in	return	for	tokens	or	a
promise	of	tokens	in	the	future.	The	tokens	can	represent	anything,	but
usually	represent	either	financial	securities	linked	to	the	success	of	the
project	(and	described	as	security	tokens)	or	access	to	a	product	or
service	created	by	the	venture	(and	described	as	utility	tokens).	At	some
stage,	tokens	may	become	listed	on	one	or	more	cryptoasset	exchanges.
Eventually,	a	product	or	service	is	created,	and	in	the	case	of	utility
tokens,	holders	may	redeem	their	tokens	for	the	product	or	service.
Whitepapers
According	to	Wikipedia
223
,	a	white	paper	is	an	authoritative	report	or
policy	paper.	The	term	was	originally	used	by	the	British	government	and
the	earliest	well-known	example	was	a	1922	paper	commissioned	by
Prime	Minister	Winston	Churchill,	entitled	‘Palestine.	Correspondence
with	the	Palestine	Arab	Delegation	and	the	Zionist	Organisation’.	As	we
will	see,	the	term	whitepaper	is	now	no	longer	exclusively	used	for	these
types	of	documents.
Bitcoin’s	ideas	were	documented	in	a	whitepaper	by	Satoshi	Nakamoto
224
.
Ethereum	was	initially	described	in	a	whitepaper
225
	written	by	Vitalik
Buterin,	followed	by	a	technical	yellow	paper
226
	written	by	Dr	Gavin
Wood.	Since	then,	most	ICO	projects	have	included	a	whitepaper,	though
over	time	the	whitepapers	seem	to	have	become	less	technical	and	have
become	a	combination	of	a	marketing	document	and	investor	prospectus.
Today’s	ICO	whitepapers	usually	describe	commercial,	technical,	and
financial	details	of	the	project,	including:
•
The	goal	of	the	project,	including	the	current	problem	and	proposed
solution
•
Milestones	for	the	development	of	the	product	or	service
•
The	project	team’s	background	and	experience
•
The	expected	total	fundraise	value
•
How	the	funds	will	be	managed	and	spent
•
The	purpose	and	use	of	the	tokens
•
The	initial	and	ongoing	distribution	of	the	tokens
You	can	see	some	examples	of	ICO	whitepapers	on
whitepaperdatabase.com,	though	it	should	be	noted	that	inclusion	in	that
website	doesn’t	mean	legitimacy	of	the	project.	You	have	been	warned!
The Token Sale
Although	ICOs	operate	differently,	there	seem	to	be	two	routes	emerging
for	the	token	sale.	A	conservative	route	may	be	taken	by	projects	whose
tokens	have	a	chance	of	being	classified	as	securities	in	relevant
jurisdictions,	and	another	route	is	used	by	projects	who	are	confident	that
their	tokens	are	not	likely	to	fall	under	securities	regulations.
Those	projects	whose	tokens	may	fall	under	securities	regulations	behave
as	if	they	are	fundraising	in	a	traditional	way.	This	means	that	they	may
not	widely	advertise	their	offering,	and	they	may	only	offer	tokens	to	rich
people	or	those	with	experience	in	complex	and	higher	risk	financial
instruments.	In	the	USA,	these	investors	are	called	‘accredited	investors’
and	other	jurisdictions	use	‘sophisticated	investors’	or	similar
terminology
227
.	Individual	accredited	investors	are	self-declared,	and	the
criteria	are	usually	based	on	some	combination	of	net	worth,	annual
income,	and	experience	in	complex	financial	instruments.	The	country	of
residence	or	citizenship	of	the	investor	is	sometimes	relevant,	and	some
ICOs	will	not	sell	tokens	to	American	citizens,	or	people	living	in	certain
countries.	These	ICOs	will	have	private	sales	but	no	public	sales	or	pre-
sales,	at	least	until	the	project	has	delivered	a	useful	product	and	the
tokens	could	be	re-defined	as	utility	tokens.
Those	projects	who	sell	tokens	that	are	likely	to	be	classified	as	non-
securities	have	more	freedom	to	sell	their	tokens	to	a	global	audience	and
will	usually	engage	in	a	private	sale,	one	or	more	pre-sales,	and	a	public
sale.
Usually	projects	offer	discounts	or	bonuses	to	encourage	investors	to
invest,	with	more	attractive	deals	for	those	participating	in	earlier
rounds.	This	can	be	achieved	by	creating	limited	investment
opportunities,	either	based	on	time,	where	the	price	gets	worse	over	time,
or	based	on	amount	raised,	where	the	price	gets	worse	as	the	amount
raised	increases.	For	example,	in	Ethereum’s	initial	crowdsale,	early
investors	received	2000	ETH	per	1	BTC	whereas	later	investors	received
only	1337	ETH	per	1	BTC.	Today,	it	is	not	uncommon	for	early	investors
to	get	up	to	an	80%	discount	on	the	intended	public	sale	price.
This	has	similarities	to	funding	rounds	for	startup	companies,	though	the
time	scales	and	investor	demands	are	different.	ICOs	can	go	from	the	first
funding	round	to	having	their	tokens	listed	on	a	cryptocurrency	exchange
funding	round	to	having	their	tokens	listed	on	a	cryptocurrency	exchange
in	a	matter	of	months	with	no	product	or	commercial	traction,	whereas	a
traditional	startup	would	usually	take	years	between	angel	investment
and	IPO,	and	investors	require	demonstrable	commercial	success	or
potential.
ICO Funding Stages
Private	sales
In	private	sales,	the	investments,	discounts,	and	bonuses	are	negotiated
bilaterally	between	the	project	and	each	investor.	The	process	is	similar
to	a	traditional	startup	raising	a	round	of	angel	or	seed	funding.
There	is	usually,	but	not	always,	a	contract	that	details	the	legal
agreement	between	the	project	and	the	investor.	A	popular	template	is
the	Simple	Agreement	for	Future	Tokens,	or	SAFT,
228
	which	was	devised
and	popularised	by	digital	currency	lawyer	Marco	Santori
229
	among
others,	in	an	effort	towards	industry	self-regulation.	The	SAFT	is	an
agreement	that	is	modelled	on	a	Simple	Agreement	for	Future	Equity
230
,	a
template	popular	with	startups.	A	SAFT	document	is	an	agreement	that
says	that	an	investor	pays	money	now	(the	form	of	money	is	irrelevant
and	can	be	fiat	or	cryptocurrency)	and	will	receive	tokens	at	a	later	date.
The	SAFT	is	a	type	of	convertible	note,	or	more	generally	a	forward
contract.	The	SAFT	itself	is	a	financial	security,	irrespective	of	the
classification	of	the	token.
Public	token	sales
Increasingly,	public	sales	are	avoided	by	those	whose	tokens	may	be
classified	a	security.	However,	they	are	still	popular	with	some	projects
due	to	their	global	reach,	ease	of	fundraising,	and	hype-ability.
The	project	usually	creates	an	Ethereum	smart	contract
231
	for	receiving
funds	and	displays	the	address	on	their	website.	Investors	send	money	to
the	smart	contract	and	receive	tokens	in	a	process	automated	by	the
smart	contract	or	a	series	of	smart	contracts.
For	some	projects,	the	tokens	may	be	ERC-20	compliant	tokens	recorded
on	the	Ethereum	blockchain.	For	others,	especially	projects	that	are
creating	new	blockchain	platforms,	the	tokens	may	be	initially	recorded
as	ERC-20	tokens	on	Ethereum,	to	be	redeemed	later	for	tokens	on	the
new	blockchain,	when	the	new	blockchain	is	up	and	running
232
.
Ethereum’s	own	crowdsale	accepted	bitcoins	as	the	funding	currency	and
the	Bitcoin	address	used	was
36PrZ1KHYMpqSyAQXSG8VwbUiq2EogxLo2.
Public	sales	tend	to	be	well-hyped.	Countdowns	and	widgets	displaying
amounts	raised	are	popular	and	often	displayed	prominently	on	the
project’s	website.	Social	media,	chat	rooms,	and	bulletin	boards	are	used
to	promote	upcoming	public	sales.
Token	pre-sales
Token	pre-sales
Pre-sales	are	the	‘sale	before	the	public	sale,’	usually	at	a	discounted	price
per	token	or	with	bonuses	available	to	investors	depending	on	the
amount	invested.	They	encourage	investors	to	invest	at	a	cheaper	price
and	form	part	of	the	hype	for	an	ICO.	An	over-subscribed	pre-sale	is	a
great	psychological	draw	for	investors	in	the	main	public	sale.
Whitelisting
Both	public	sales	and	pre-sales	may	have	some	address	‘whitelisting’	as
part	of	a	project’s	efforts	to	identify	their	investors.	Before	the	token	sale,
potential	investors	click	through	a	series	of	web	pages,	declare	their
identity	information,	perhaps	upload	a	picture	of	their	passport,	agree
that	they	do	not	live	in	certain	countries,	accept	terms	and	conditions,
and	provide	the	cryptocurrency	address	they	intend	to	send	funds	from.
During	the	actual	token	sale,	the	smart	contract	receiving	funds	will	only
accept	funds	from	those	cryptocurrency	addresses	that	have	been
whitelisted.
Funding Caps
ICOs	will	declare	funding	caps	in	their	whitepapers.	These	are	floors	and
ceilings	to	the	amount	of	funds	the	projects	are	willing	to	accept	at	any
stage	of	the	sales	processes.	A	soft	cap	usually	represents	the	minimum
amount	of	funds	needed	for	the	project	to	go	ahead	(similar	to
Kickstarter’s	‘funding	goal’),	and	a	hard	cap	usually	represents	the
maximum	the	project	will	accept.	Not	every	ICO	will	have	a	hard	or	soft
cap,	and	some	may	change	them	according	to	demand.
Treasury
Projects	will	often	create	more	tokens	than	are	sold	in	token	sales,
keeping	some	proportion	behind	in	reserve.	These	reserves	may	be	used
keeping	some	proportion	behind	in	reserve.	These	reserves	may	be	used
to	reward	founders,	pay	staff	or	contractors,	or	to	stabilise	the	price	of	the
tokens	on	exchanges.	The	project	may	self-impose	limits	on	how	fast	the
reserves	can	be	spent,	a	sort	of	vesting	schedule,	which	offers	investors
some	confidence	that	the	project	is	not	going	to	sell	a	large	number	of
tokens	held	in	treasury	immediately	after	a	sale	and	cause	downward
pressure	on	the	price.
Once	a	token	is	listed,	the	project	will	have	some	idea	as	to	the	value	of
the	tokens	they	hold	in	treasury.	In	accounting	terminology,	these	tokens
are	held	on	the	company’s	balance	sheet,	and	so	they	impact	the	equity
valuation	of	the	company.	Shareholders,	particularly	venture	capitalists,
may	like	ICOs	because	they	can	create	value	on	the	company’s	balance
sheet	out	of	nothing!
Exchange Listing
Some	investors	may	buy	tokens	at	ICO	to	use	the	eventual	product,
service,	or	blockchain,	but	often	investors	want	to	make	money	by	selling
the	tokens	at	a	higher	price	than	they	bought	them	for.
So	the	ability	to	easily	sell	the	tokens	is	important	to	investors.	Although
tokens	are	immediately	transferrable	between	people	once	they	are
assigned	to	investors,	and	therefore	tokens	may	be	bought	and	sold	‘over
the	counter,’	the	listing	of	the	token	on	cryptoasset	exchanges	is	a	key
event	in	the	lifetime	of	an	ICO	because	exchanges	make	the	tokens	more
liquid.	The	transferability	of	the	token	makes	the	token	different	from
rewards-based	crowdfunding,	such	as	Kickstarter,	where	participants	are
not	able	to	easily	resell	their	rewards	to	others.
Listings	may	be	positive	or	negative	for	the	price	of	the	token	and	price
volatility	can	be	high	in	the	first	few	days	of	a	token	listing.	If	the	project
is	popular,	the	listing	can	create	an	opportunity	for	new	investors	to
is	popular,	the	listing	can	create	an	opportunity	for	new	investors	to
accumulate	the	tokens,	causing	a	rapid	increase	in	price.	If	the	project	is
unpopular,	early	investors	may	use	the	listing	as	an	opportunity	to	sell
their	tokens,	causing	a	rapid	fall	in	price.
Token	listings	are	such	an	important	event	in	the	project	that	exchanges
can	charge	projects	significant	amounts	of	money	to	list	their	token.
Listing	fees	of	over	a	million	US	dollars	are	not	uncommon.	The	exchange
may	also	provide	liquidity	services,	creating	a	market	for	the	coins.	When
a	token	is	listed,	the	project	will	monitor	the	price	carefully,	and	some
have	strategies	of	buying	tokens	back	when	the	price	is	low.	The	ethics
and	legality	of	this	is	a	popular	source	of	discussion.	Traditional
companies	may	issue	shares	when	stock	markets	are	high	and	perform
share	buybacks	when	prices	are	attractive,	however,	this	is	not	an	exact
parallel	of	what	happens	in	ICO-land,	and	traditional	companies	pay
more	attention	to	regulations	about	disclosure	and	trading	activities.
The	number	of	exchanges,	reputation	of	exchanges,	and	liquidity	on	those
exchanges	is	important	for	the	project	and	for	investors.	Investors	prefer
to	see	a	token	listed	on	multiple	reputable	exchanges	with	large	numbers
of	customers	and	lots	of	liquidity.
Despite	the	importance	of	exchange	listing,	projects	tend	to	avoid
discussing	exchange	listing	timelines,	especially	those	who	are	trying	to
keep	their	tokens	from	being	classified	as	securities.	This	is	because
discussion	of	exchange	listing	adds	weight	to	classification	of	the	token	as
a	security,	since	there	is	arguably	more	of	an	expectation	of	profit	from
investors.
It’s	worth	noting	that	while	traditional	stock	exchanges	impose
requirements	on	the	companies	they	list,	such	as	periodic	public
disclosure	of	financials,	cryptoasset	exchanges	usually	do	not	have	such
listing	requirements,	nor	are	the	exchanges	obligated	to	perform	any	due
diligence	on	projects	whose	coins	they	are	listing.	Some	cryptocurrency
exchanges	are	happy	to	list	any	token,	even	those	with	a	low	likelihood	of
success	(known	colloquially	as	‘shitcoins’)	because	the	exchanges	make
revenues	from	trading	fees,	and	so	are	indiff
erent	to	the	quality	of	the
project	or	the	absolute	value	of	the	tokens	they	list.	The	exchanges	make
money	as	long	as	there	is	price	volati
lity.
When Is a Token a Security?
Earlier,	we	discussed	that	projects	take	different	actions	based	on
whether	they	think	their	token	is,	or	could	be	classified	as,	a	financial
security.	The	classification	of	a	token	as	a	security	is	important	as	it
impacts	who	can	do	what	with	the	token,	because	activities	relating	to
financial	securities	are	regulated	in	most	countries.	Note	that	tokens
themselves	are	not	regulated,	but	activities	relating	to	them	are.
So	how	do	we	decide	if	a	token	may	be	classified	as	a	security	or	not?	In
the	USA,	the	‘Howey	Test’	is	a	well-known	test	that	was	created	by	the
United	States	Supreme	Court	in	1946	during	a	case	‘SEC	vs.	Howey’.
According	to	the	FindLaw	website
233
:
In Howey, two Florida-based corporate defendants offered real estate contracts for tracts of
land with citrus groves. The defendants offered buyers the option of leasing any purchased
land back to the defendants, who would then tend to the land, and harvest, pool, and market
the citrus. As most of the buyers were not farmers and did not have agricultural expertise,
they were happy to lease the land back to the defendants.
The SEC sued the defendants over these transactions, claiming that they broke the law by not
filing a securities registration statement. The Supreme Court, in issuing its decision finding
that the defendants’ leaseback agreement is a form of security, developed a landmark test for
determining whether certain transactions are investment contracts (and thus subject to
securities registration requirements). Under the Howey Test, a transaction is an investment
contract if:
1. It is an investment of money
2. There is an expectation of profits from the investment
3. The investment of money is in a common enterprise
4. Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party
Although the Howey Test uses the term ‘money,’ later cases have expanded this to include
investments of assets other than money.
So	each	token	offering	could	be	checked	against	the	Howey	Test	to
determining	whether	the	tokens	qualify	as	‘investment	contracts’.	If	so,
then	under	the	Securities	Act	of	1933	and	the	Securities	Exchange	Act	of
1934,	those	tokens	are	considered	securities	and	so	activities	relating	to
them	are	subject	to	certain	requirements	
in	the
	
USA.
In	February	2018,	the	Swiss	financial	regulator	FINMA	issued
guidelines
234
,	saying	that	tokens	can	fall	into	one	or	more	of	the	following
categories,	described	below:
Payment	tokens
	are	synonymous	with	cryptocurrencies	and	have	no
further	functions	or	links	to	other	development	projects.	Tokens	may	in
some	cases	only	develop	the	necessary	functionality	and	become
accepted	as	a	means	of	payment	over	a	period	of	time.
Utility	tokens
	are	tokens	which	are	intended	to	provide	digital	access
to	an	application	or	service.
Asset	tokens
	represent	assets	such	as	participations	in	real	physical
underlyings,	companies,	or	earnings	streams,	or	an	entitlement	to
dividends	or	interest	payments.	In	terms	of	their	economic	function,
the	tokens	are	analogous	to	equities,	bonds	or	derivatives.
FINMA	suggests	the	following	framework
235
,	for	determining	whether	a
token	is	a	financial	security	or	not,	and	this	seems	reasonable	in	the
current	stage	of	industry	development:
In	June	2018,	William	Hinman,	Director,	Division	of	Corporate	Finance
at	the	United	Stated	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	(SEC)	said	in	a
speech
236
,
‘Based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its
decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. And,
as with Bitcoin, applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current
transactions in Ether would seem to add little value’.
He	differentiates	the	manner	in	which	something	(a	token)	is	originally
sold,	and	the	later	use	and	sale	of	the	token.	A	token	can	have	utility	and
also	be	offered	as	an	investment	contract,	i.e.,	a	financial	security.	He
explains,
‘The oranges in Howey had utility. Or in my favorite example, the Commission warned in the
late 1960s about investment contracts sold in the form of whisky warehouse receipts.
late 1960s about investment contracts sold in the form of whisky warehouse receipts.
Promoters sold the receipts to U.S. investors to finance the aging and blending processes of
Scotch whisky. The whisky was real—and, for some, had exquisite utility. But Howey was not
selling oranges and the warehouse receipts promoters were not selling whisky for
consumption. They were selling investments, and the purchasers were expecting a return
from the promoters’ efforts’.
This	means	that,	irrespective	of	what	a	token	represents,	the	manner	in
which	it	is	offered	and	the	utility	of	the	token	at	the	time	of	offering	is
important.	We	will	see	over	the	coming	years	how	this	important	speech
impacts	the	manner	in	which	ICOs	are	conducted.
Conclusion
Although	we	are	in	the	early	stages	of	the	token	industry,	we	can	see	that
it	is	already	beginning	to	mature.
In	early	ICOs,	projects	would	write	disclaimers	in	small	print	stating	that
the	tokens	are	not	an	investment	or	a	security,	hoping	that	this	would	be
enough	to	protect	them.	These	investment	rounds	were	sometimes
described	by	the	projects	as	‘donations’	or	‘contribution	rounds’	in	order
to	disassociate	with	legally	sensitive	terminology.	There	was	a	clear
disconnect	between	investor	expectations	of	the	tokens	and	the	wording
in	the	investor	documents.	Unfortunately	for	those	with	that	view,
wording	matters	less	than	the	economic	realities,	as	projects	are	finding
out.
In	2017,	there	was	a	wave	of	attempts	to	self-regulate	and	create	industry
standards.	Projects	trying	to	do	the	right	thing	looked	for	regulatory
clarity.	Today,	the	amount	of	money	at	stake	is	significant,	and	regulators
and	policymakers	are	catching	up	with	token	sales.	This	is	a	good	thing
for	the	maturity	of	the	industry,	as	regulatory	clarity	can	attract
investment	and	allow	projects	the	opportunity	to	focus	on	business	rather
than	legal	uncertainty.
Regulators	are	now	clarifying	what	they	will	and	won’t	accept,	and	in
light	of	clarifications,	projects	are	moving	to	comply	with	or	avoid
regulation.	Different	regulators	may	take	different	approaches,	creating
opportunities	for	projects	to	select	the	most	favourable	operational
jurisdictions.	I	am	looking	forward	to	the	next	few	years	when	more
projects	deliver	products	and	we	learn	how	to	quantitatively	put	a	value
on	tokens.	The	economics	of	tokens,	or	
tokenomics
,	are	yet	to	be	fully
described	or	understood.


Part 8
INVESTING
In	this	section,	I	describe	some	considerations	to	help	you	decide	whether
investing	in	cryptoassets	is	right	for	you.	There	are	many	risks,	but	the
markets	are	exciting	and	people	have	made	and	lost	fortunes	in	the	these
markets.
PRICING
How	do	you	put	a	value	on	cryptocurrencies	or	cryptoassets?	For	tokens
that	are	a	claim	on	an	underlying	asset	such	as	1	oz	of	gold,	the	price	of
the	token	should	more	or	less	track	the	price	of	the	underlying	asset.
However,	as	previously	discussed,	cryptocurrencies	are	not	a	claim	on
any	asset,	nor	are	they	backed	by	an	entity.	Is	there	a	way	to	calculate	a
fair	value	for	them?
We	can	ask	three	independent	questions:
1.
What	is	the	current	price	of	the	cryptoasset?
2.
What	causes	prices	to	change?
3.
What	should	the	price	be?
What	is	the	current	price	of	the
	
cryptoasset?
The	current	price	of	any	asset	is	determined	by	the	market.	Cryptoassets
trade	on	one	or	more	exchanges,	and	both	prices	and	liquidity	can	differ
between	exchanges.	Exchanges	that	report	the	most	trade	volume	provide
a	good	measure	of	the	price,	as	they	are	the	most	active	and	should	have
the	most	liquidity.	Other	exchanges	may	have	higher	or	lower	prices.
Coinmarketcap.com	is	one	of	many	websites	that	provide	data	about	the
current	price	of	tokens	and	which	exchanges	they	trade	on.	If	you	click	on
the	name	of	a	token	and	then	click	on	‘Markets,’	you	can	see	where	that
token	trades	and	how	much	volume	the	exchange	says	it	has	traded.	Note
that	some	exchanges	have	been	caught	faking	trade	volume	in	order	to
generate	business,	and	I	am	not	confident	this	practice	has	been
eliminated…	beware!
What	causes	prices	to
	
change?
The	prices	of	cryptocurrencies	and	tokens	behave	like	any	other	financial
asset,	driven	by	buyers	and	sellers	who	make	trading	decisions	based	on
various	factors:
1.
Sentiment	(how	traders	feel	about	the	asset)
2.
Gossip	and	chatter	on	forums	and	social	media	sites
3.
Technical	successes	(e.g.,	when	blockchains	successfully	implement
technical	upgrades	that	make	them	more	useful,	or	when	an	ICO
makes	progress	on	its	roadmap)
4.
Technical	failures	(e.g.,	if	transactions	slow	down	or	a	weakness	is
found	in	the	way	the	blockchain	operates)
5.
Celebrity	endorsements	(e.g.,	Paris	Hilton’s	endorsement	of
LydianCoin	in	Sept	2017,	or	John	Mcafee’s	occasional	promotional
tweets)
6.
Founders	getting	arrested	(e.g.,	when	the	founders	of	Centra	token
were	arrested	in	the	USA,	and	the	price	of	the	tokens	fell	by	60%

)
7.

.
What	should	the	price
	
be?
There	have	been	a	number	of	attempts	to	create	models	to	find	a	fair
value	for	cryptocurrencies	and	tokens.	A	common	but	flawed	model	for
putting	a	value	on	a	Bitcoin	is	the	‘if	the	money	in	gold	went	into	Bitcoin’
model:
model:
‘If x% of the money in gold (or other asset class) moved into Bitcoin, a single Bitcoin should
be worth $y’.
The	argument	is	as	follows:	The	total	value	of	gold	in	circulation	is
estimated	at	8	trillion	US	dollars.	If	some	small	proportion	of	the	people
holding	gold,	say	5%	(but	you	can	use	any	number	from	0-100%	here),
sold	their	gold	for	dollars,	it	would	release	a	large	amount	of	money,	in
this	case	$400	billion.	If	the	dollar	proceeds	were	used	to	buy	bitcoins,
the	total	value	of	bitcoins	in	circulation,	commonly	referred	to	as	‘market
capitalisation’	or	‘market	cap,’	would	increase	by	the	same	amount,	$400
billion.	As	we	know,	the	total	number	of	bitcoins	in	circulation,	17	million
or	so,	then	this	must	increase	the	price	of	
each	Bitcoin
	by	$23.5k
($400bn	/	17m).
But	this	logic	is	wrong.	That	is	not	how	financial	markets	work	at	all.	The
‘money	going	into	Bitcoin’	doesn’t	simply	drop	into	the	‘market	cap’.	The
reason	is	simple:	When	you	buy	$10,000	worth	of	Bitcoin,	someone	else
is	selling	those	bitcoins	for	$10,000.	So	any	money	‘pumped	in’	is	also
exactly	equal	to	money	‘pumped	out’	(excluding	exchange	fees,	to	keep
things	simple).	The	only	thing	that	happens	when	you	buy	a	Bitcoin	is
that	the	Bitcoin	changes	ownership	and	some	cash	changes	ownership.
There	is	no	mathematical	relationship	between	how	much	money	you
spend	buying	bitcoins	from	someone	else	and	the	market	cap	of	Bitcoin.
Let’s	put	numbers	to	this	and	demonstrate	the	flawed	logic	with	a
counterexample…	Let’s	say	the	last	price	paid	for	BTC	was	$10,000.	So
the	‘market	cap’	of	Bitcoin,	assuming	17	million	Bitcoin	outstanding,	is:
$10,000	x	17m	=	$170,000,000,000	($170bn)
Now,	let’s	say	you	want	to	buy	a	tiny	amount	of	BTC	(say	$10	worth),	and
the	best	price	that	you	can	see	is	$10,002.	So	you	pay	$10	and	buy
0.0009998	BTC	($10	divided	by	$10,002	per	Bitcoin).	What	has
happened	to	the	‘market	cap?’	It	is	now:	$10,002	x	17m	=
$170,034,000,000.
The	market	cap	has	increased	by	$34	million	just	because	of	your	measly
$10	trade!	You	didn’t	‘pump	in’	$34	million,	but	the	market	cap	increased
by	that	amount.	So	clearly	the	earlier	argument	is	wrong.
Having	said	that…of	course	if	there	are	more	buyers	with	a	greater	desire
to	buy	and	pay	whatever	it	takes	to	accumulate	BTC,	then	the	prices	will
increase.	Likewise,	if	there	are	sellers	who	will	sell	bitcoins	at	any	price,
then	prices	will	fall.
I	also	hear	variations	on,	‘cost	of	creation’	argument:	The	price	of	Bitcoin
should	be	at	least	the	cost	of	mining	them,	so	the	cost	of	mining	puts	a
floor	under	the	price	of	Bitcoin,	and	as	difficulty	increases,	it	costs	more
to	mine	bitcoins,	so	the	price	should	rise.	Alas,	this	is	also	false.	The	cost
incurred	by	a	miner	(or	even	all	the	miners	in	aggregate)	bears	no
relation	to	the	market	price	of	Bitcoin.	The	price	of	Bitcoin	affects	the
profitability
	of	miners,	but	there	is	no	rule	dictating	that	miners	need	to
be	profitable.	If	a	miner	is	unprofitable,	they	will	eventually	stop	mining,
but	this	doesn’t	affect	the	price	of	bitcoins.	If	it	costs	me	$5,000	to	dig	up
1	oz	of	gold,	this	doesn’t	mean	the	price	of	gold	should	be	at	least
$5,000/oz.	User	ihrhase	explains	this	with	salmon	and	sauerkraut
smoothies	in	a	forum	post
239
	in	2010:
Unfortunately,	I	have	not	yet	come	across	a	reasonable	fair	value	model
for	cryptocurrencies.
ICO	tokens	
should
	be	easier	to	price.	These	tokens	are	redeemable	for	a
certain	good	or	service	in	the	future,	so	putting	a	price	on	the	token
should	be	a	case	of	figuring	out	what	that	good	or	service	is	worth.	Right?
Alas,	it	is	never	that	easy.	The	fact	is	that	ICOs	who	issue	tokens	want	the
price	of	their	tokens	to	go	up,	as	do	their	investors.	Redemption	is	always
described	generically	and	not	
quantified
.	For	example,	they	say,	‘Tokens
will	allow	you	access	to	cloud	storage,’	rather	than,	‘One	token	will	give
you	10	GB	of	cloud	storage	for	1	year	starting	in	2020’.	This	is	a	deliberate
strategy.	If	the	issuers	
quantified
	the	goods	or	services,	you	could	figure
out	an	appropriate	ballpark	price	for	the	token.	But	this	would	constrain
the	price,	preventing	the	price	of	the	token	from	massively	increasing
(which	is	really	what	ICO	issuers	and	investors	really	want).	I	have	never
seen	an	ICO	whitepaper	
quantify
	exactly	what	a	token	will	be	redeemable
for.
Who Controls the Price of Utility Tokens?
The	simple	answer	might	seem	to	be	‘the	market’	or	‘buyers	and	sellers,’
but	this	is	not	the	full	picture	as	we	have	an	issuer	who	can	pull	some
tricks	to	affect	the	value	of	a	token.	Initially,	the	quantity	of
goods/services	that	the	tokens	can	buy	is	unspecified,	so	the	price	of	the
token	is	subject	to	normal	cryptocurrency	market	forces,	and	there	is	no
way	to	do	fundamental	analysis	on	what	a	fair	market	price	should	be
(you	can’t	price	‘cloud	storage’	without	quantifying	how	much,	for	how
long).	During	this	period,	some	ICOs	exert	some	influence	on	the	price	of
their	tokens	by	buying	them	up	when	the	price	falls.	Some	ICOs	even
discuss	this	strategy	in	their	whitepapers.	ICOs	often	retain	a	significant
amount	of	tokens	in	their	treasury,	so	they	can	sell	some	if	the	price
rallies	too	aggressively.	Essentially,	they	may	act	like	a	central	bank	of
rallies	too	aggressively.	Essentially,	they	may	act	like	a	central	bank	of
their	tokens,	managing	the	price.
Later,	there	comes	a	point	when	the	project	has	to	make	a	decision:	Do
they	set	prices	in	fiat	or	in	tokens?	Should	1	GB	of	cloud	storage	for	1-year
cost	$10,	payable	in	tokens	at	market	rate,	or	should	1	GB	of	cloud
storage	for	1-year	cost	one	token?
Let’s	explore	the	options.
1)	Priced	in	fiat,	paid	in
	
tokens
If	this	is	the	case,	then	at	first	you’d	think	that	the	price	of	tokens	should
be	irrelevant.	Customers	hold	fiat,	then	when	they	want	to	use	the
service,	they	buy	the	tokens	then	quickly	redeem	them.	This	process
could	be	automated	so	the	customer	doesn’t	know	it	is	going	on	in	the
background.	This	is	the	same	argument	that	remittance-by-Bitcoin
companies	use	when	they	say	that	the	price	of	Bitcoin	is	irrelevant	to
their	business.
In	this	case,	are	tokens	a	good	investment?	Perhaps.	As	tokens	are
redeemed	against	the	issuer,	fewer	and	fewer	of	them	exist	in	circulation,
so	long	as	the	project	does	not	re-issue	them	and	sell	them	for	fiat	to	pay
their	staff.	Fewer	tokens	may	mean	a	higher	price	due	to	scarcity.	So	a
project	in	good	financial	health,	not	reliant	on	reselling	redeemed	tokens
to	pay	their	costs,	can	allow	tokens	to	become	more	scarce	over	time,
perhaps	putting	upwards	pressure	on	their	price.	Perhaps.	But	a	project
in	poor	financial	health	will	need	to	keep	reselling	their	tokens	to	cover
their	costs.	So	actually,	the	financial	health	of	the	company	may	impact
the	pricing	pressures	on	the	token.
2)	Priced	in	tokens,	paid	in
	
tokens
This	is	wonderful:	if	the	company	sets	the	price	of	the	goods	or	services	in
tokens,	the	company	will	have	control	over	the	value	of	their	tokens,	just
as	an	airline	controls	the	value	of	the	air	miles	they	issue.	How	does	this
work?	Unless	the	product	or	service	is	unique,	customers	will	have	some
idea	about	how	much	they	are	willing	to	pay	for	it.	Imagine	that	a
competitor	sells	a	similar	product	for	$10.	If	the	project	wants	their
tokens	to	be	worth	$10,	then	they	set	their	product	at	a	price	of	one
token.	If	they	want	their	tokens	to	be	worth	$20,	then	they	set	their
product	at	a	price	of	0.5	tokens!	The	competitor’s	pricing	helps	to	peg	the
token’s	price	and	as	long	as	the	products	are	somewhat	substitutable,	the
project	can	make	their	tokens	worth	whatever	they	want.	They	should
understand	that	as	they	do	this,	their	liabilities	change.	Their	liabilities
are	the	outstanding	tokens	in	circulation,	and	by	changing	the	price	of
one	product	from	one	token	to	0.5	tokens,	existing	tokenholders	can
redeem	tokens	for	twice	as	many	products.
If	the	company	decides	to	price	their	product	in	tokens,	are	tokens	a	good
investment?	Probably.	The	founders	of	the	project,	provided	they	haven’t
done	a	quick	exit	scam,	also	hold	tokens	and	are	financially	incentivised
to	keep	the	price	of	tokens	high	and	relatively	stable.
So,	projects	have	more	control	over	their	token	price	if	they	price	their
services	in	tokens,	and	I	would	expect	that,	as	projects	come	to	maturity,
we	will	see	projects	priced	in	tokens,	providing	that	the	projects	haven’t
been	shut	down	for	violating	securities	regulations	first.
Anshuman	Mehta	attempted	to	price	a	fictional	utility	token	on	his	blog
240
and	concluded	that,	‘In	a	fiat	currency	world,	the	market	or	traded	price
of	the	token	is	completely	de-linked	with	the	usage	and	velocity	of	the
token’.
RISKS AND MITIGATIONS 
MARKET
RISK CRYPTOASSET PRICES ARE
VOLATILE AND MANY HAVE FALLEN
TO ZERO. AT TIME OF WRITING,
DEADCOINS.COM

 LISTS OVER 800
COINS WHOSE PRICE HAS FALLEN TO

CRYPTOASSET CAN POTENTIALLY FALL

SCENARIO MAY SEEM LESS LIKELY
FOR POPULAR CRYPTOCURRENCIES;
TIME, A SIGNIFICANT HACK, OR
EXPLOITED VULNERABILITY COULD

Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that
the market cannot support your transaction
at the price you expect. Liquidity comes and
goes, as with all markets. Less popular coins
are less liquid, meaning that a large buy or
sell can move the market against you more
than expected.
With	less	popular	coins	or	coins	of	regulatory	uncertainty,	there	is	also	a
risk	that	they	are	de-listed	by	exchanges,	which	reduces	their	liquidity.
For	example,	in	May	2018,	Poloniex	announced	that	they	were	de-listing
seventeen	tokens:	
Exchange Risks It is convenient to keep
assets on exchanges because you don’t have
to deal with private keys, and you can
quickly trade between assets. However
exchanges have had an extremely poor track
record of keeping customer assets secure.

the past. Michael Matthews published a

From	this	analysis,	we	can	see	not	only	that	exchanges	have	been
successfully	hacked	by	external	parties,	but	it	is	not	unknown	for	staff	at
exchanges	to	steal	cryptocurrencies	from	their	customers.
On	his	website,	Blockchain	Graveyard
243
,	Ryan	McGeehan	manages	a	list
of	security	breaches	and	thefts	with	their	causes,	based	on	public
information.	The	root	cause	analysis	shows	that	there	are	multiple	ways
for	exchanges	to	be	hacked:	

Being	hacked	is	an	existential	threat	to	exchanges.	So	the	top	exchanges
take	security	extremely	seriously.	Nevertheless,	prudence	suggests	that
you	should	use	exchanges	only	when	necessary,	and	to	withdraw	funds	as
soon	as	possible	after	trading.	Only	keep	as	much	on	an	exchange	as	you
are	willing	to	lose.
Exchanges	and	users	of	exchanges	may	also	engage	in	illegal	or	unethical
activity.	Tricks,	borrowed	from	the	wholesale	financial	markets	industry,
include:	
•
Painting	the	tape:	Artificially	increasing	trading	activity	by
having	parties	controlled	by	the	exchange	repeatedly	trade	with	each
other.	This	‘fake	volume’	encourages	other	customers	to	trade.
•
Spoofing:	Submitting	orders	with	the	intention	of	cancelling	them
before	they	are	matched.	This	trick	can	be	used	to	drive	prices	up	or
down.
•
Front-running:	An	exchange	can	see	a	customer	order	and	use	the
information	to	trade	before	the	customer’s	order	is	accepted.
•
Running	stops:	A	certain	type	of	customer	order,	called	a	‘stop	loss,’
is	not	visible	to	other	customers	of	the	exchange	but	is	visible	to	the
exchange.	Insiders	who	can	see	customer	stop	loss	orders	can	use
this	information	to	trade	against	their	own	customers.	This	is	a
popular	trick	in	FX	markets.
•
Fake	liquidity:	Exchanges	can	publish	‘unfillable’	orders	that
disappear,	or	only	partially	fill,	when	a	customer	tries	to	match
them.	This	makes	it	look	like	there	is	more	liquidity	on	the	exchange
than	there	actually	is.
There	are	many	other	tricks	that	may	be	used	either	by	exchanges	or	by
customers	of	exchanges	while	the	management	of	the	exchange	looks	the
other	way.	Different	exchanges	behave	with	different	levels	of
professionalism.	Many	exchanges	are	dodgy.	Do	your	own	research!
Wallet Risks With wallets, there is a trade-
off between security and convenience.
Wallets that run online on computers or
smartphones are convenient because it is
easy to make cryptocurrency payments.
However, storing private keys on a device
exposed to the internet is not advised. Some
people keep a small amount of
cryptocurrency on their phone wallet so they
can make payments instantly, but the
advice, again, is to keep only as much in
them as you are willing to lose
244
.
In	the	past,	it	was	common	for	people	to	print	private	keys	onto	bits	of
paper,	a	technique	known	as	cold	storage,	discussed	previously,	but	this
is	troublesome	for	making	payments.	Now,	hardware	wallets	are	the	best
compromise	between	security	and	convenience.	But	the	risk	remains	with
any	wallet	type	that	the	software	contains	bugs	or	vulnerabilities	that	can
be	exploited.	Many	wallets	open	source	their	code	to	allow	developers
and	security	professionals	to	understand	exactly	how	the	wallet	works,
and	to	take	comfort	that	there	are	no	weaknesses,	but	this	also	provides
transparency	to	hackers.
Regulatory Risks Regulation around
cryptocurrencies and tokens is evolving. It is
worth understanding as fully as possible the
nature of the assets you are considering.
ICOs are operating in a legal grey area in
many jurisdictions, and there is a risk that
some are deemed to have been illegally
performing regulated activities.
Depending	on	the	jurisdiction	and	classification	of	cryptoassets,	and	what
you	are	doing	with	them,	tax	also	needs	to	be	considered.	You	are	not
excused	from	complying	with	tax	regulations	just	because	the	assets	are
recorded	on	blockchains!
Scams
Finally,	due	to	the	nature	of	the	cryptocurrency	industry,	many	scams
operate.	Hype,	technical	complexity,	regulatory	uncertainty,	and	naïve
investors	hoping	to	make	a	quick	buck	all	make	for	an	environment	ripe
for	fraudsters.	Some	popular	scams	are:	
•
Ponzi	schemes:	Investors	are
promised	good	returns	and	old	investors	are	paid	with	new	investors’
money.
•
Exit	scams:	Founders	of	a	project,	wallet,	exchange	or	investment
scheme	run	off	with	customer	money.
•
Fake	hacks:	Project	gets	hacked	by	an	associate	who	shares	profit
with	the	project	team.
•
Pump	&	Dumps:	Illiquid	coins	are	bought	cheaply	by	fraudsters	then
hyped	on	social	media	and	sold	at	a	higher	price	to	new	investors.
•
Scam	ICOs:	ICO	raises	money	with	no	intention	of	delivering	a
product.	Sometimes	they	will	list	well	known	industry	experts	as
advisors	or	as	part	of	the	team	to	get	credibility,	without	the
knowledge	or	approval	of	the	expert.
•
Spoof	ICOs:	Clones	of	real	ICO	websites	made	with	the	scammer’s
deposit	address	instead	of	the	legitimate	deposit	address.
•
Scam	mining	schemes:	Claims	that	investors	will	earn	lots	of
cryptocurrency	but	key	information	such	as	difficulty	increases	is	not
disclosed.
•
Fake	wallets:	Wallet	software	that	allows	the	scammer	to	access
private	keys,	so	the	coins	can	be	stolen	from	the	user.
And	so	on.	There	are	many	variations	to	these,	and	scammers	are	proving
increasingly	innovative!
I	hope	this	chapter	has	given	you	some	food	for	thought.	People	have
made	and	lost	fortunes	trading	cryptocurrencies	and	investing	in	ICOs,
but	there	are	many	risks.	If	you	do	decide	to	get	involved,	be	careful	and
do	a	lot	of	research	before	committing	your	money.
Part 9
CONCLUSION
CONCLUSION
In	this	book,	I	set	out	to	explain	the	basics	of	bitcoins	and	blockchains,
and	I	hope	that	it	has	been	easy	to	follow.	At	the	very	least,	I	have
provided	some	ideas	about	concepts	and	terms	for	you	to	research
further,	and	perhaps	ignited	a	curiosity	that	you	may	not	have	had	before.
Amid	the	hype,	it	is	important	to	understand	that	the	blockchain
industry,	including	cryptocurrencies,	business	blockchains,	and
tokenisation	of	assets	is	very	much	in	its	infancy.	Two	important	things
seem	to	have	been	created:
1.
New	censorship	resistant	financial	assets,	methods	of	value	transfer,
and	transparent	automation
2.
New	technologies	for	business-to-business	data	and	asset	transfer
We	can	call	these,	respectively,	a	‘crypto’	story	and	a	‘blockchain’	story.
The	crypto
	
story
Public	blockchains	are	creating	a	new	wave	of	censorship	resistant	digital
assets	and	unstoppable	automated	computations.	For	the	first	time	in
history,	people	can	transfer	value	electronically	worldwide	without
needing	specific	third	parties	to	approve	the	transaction.	Payments	can
be	sent	to	transparent	smart	contracts	that	guarantee	certain	outcomes
without	manual	steps	or	needing	to	trust	a	third	party	to	do	what	they
have	promised.	Public	blockchains	are	being	explored	for	a	wide	range	of
uses	from	online	micropayments	through	to	remittances,	fundraising	and
record	keeping.
The	blockchain
	
story
Businesses	are	investing	in	private	and	public	blockchains	to	see	if	they
can	reduce	costs	and	risks,	increase	revenues,	or	create	new	business
models.	Private	blockchains	are	a	more	recent	idea	than	public
blockchains,	and	are	rapidly	evolving	and	improving.	These	multi-party
database	systems	promise	to	remove	duplicative	processes	and	allow
digital	assets	and	records	to	move	freely	between	businesses,	reducing
reliance	on	expensive	intermediaries.
THE FUTURE
Are	these	blockchains	a	bubble	or	fad?	In	my	view,	no.	Both	public	and
private	blockchains	have	their	roles	and	will	continue	to	evolve	and
deliver	value	in	ways	we	might	not	even	be	able	to	envisage	today.
In	the	public	cryptocurrency	industry,	Innovation	will	continue	to
accelerate	as	tokens	create	financial	incentives	that	attract	developers
and	other	staff.	The	speed	and	intensity	of	innovation	will	increase	if
popular	cryptoassets	increase	in	price.	Many	developers	personally	hold
cryptocurrencies	and	tokens,	and	so	are	directly	financially	incentivised
to	make	their	projects	successful,	even	more	so	than	staff	at	traditional
startups	who	often	only	have	a	tiny	sliver	of	equity.
We	will	continue	to	see	the	tokenisation	of	assets,	products,	and	services.
Computer	game	items	are	a	good	candidate	for	this.	Imagine	being	able
to	own	the	unique	sword	that	a	famous	gamer	used	to	defeat	an
opponent.	Imagine	owning	the	signed	digital	football	that	was	used	in	an
e-sports	World	Cup	final.	Or	owning	the	digital	shirt	that	a	popular
character	wore	during	the	match.	There	is	an	entire	market	of	digital
collectables	that	will	be	opened	up.	The	confluence	of	e-gaming	and
cryptoassets	is	going	to	create	some	extremely	exciting	opportunities	and
new	markets.	E-sports	and	cryptoassets	are	a	trend,	not	a	fad,	and	it
would	be	unwise	to	bet	against	them
245
.
ICOs	will	continue	to	be	popular,	and	the	industry	will	begin	to
standardise	with	best	practices	and	common	investor	expectations.
Perhaps	one	day	we	might	figure	out	a	way	to	value	tokens.	Regulations
will	become	more	clear,	and	this	will	enable	those	currently	on	the	side-
lines	to	participate.
Whether	bitcoins,	Ether,	and	other	cryptocurrencies	become	more	price-
stable	or	not,	we	will	see	cryptoassets	that	have	a	stable	price	with	respect
to	fiat	currencies
246
.	We	can	call	these	
stablecoins
	or	
crypto-fiat
.	Fiat
currency,	or	a	near	equivalent,	will	be	tokenised	and	recorded	on
blockchains.	Whether	these	crypto-fiat	tokens	are	best	issued	by	central
banks,	banks,	e-money	businesses,	or	somehow	managed	by	smart
contracts	is	still	to	be	determined.	There	are	a	number	of	initiatives	to
create	these	price-stable	tokens	on	both	public	and	private	blockchains.
Stable	cryptoassets	will	enable	another	cycle	of	innovation.
However,	public	blockchains	are	suffering	growing	pains	as	they	grow	in
transaction	volume	and	throughput.	In	recent	years	both	Bitcoin	and
Ethereum	have	had	periods	of	stress	where	miners	couldn’t	process
transactions	quickly	enough,	causing	backlogs.	Engineers	are	working	on
solutions	to	these	problems,	and	concepts	such	as	sharding	and	state
channels	can	allow	public	blockchains	to	scale.
Forks	and	chainsplits	will	become	more	problematic	due	to	the	confusion
that	they	create	(which	is	the	‘real’	blockchain	and	which	is	the	fork?).
Proof-of-work	is	energy	intensive	and	is	polluting	the	planet.	Ethereum
may	move	from	proof-of-work	to	proof-of-stake,	a	much	less	energy
intensive	block-writing	mechanism,	and	if	successful,	other	blockchains
may	follow	suit.
As	the	amount	of	value	recorded	on	blockchains	increases,	governance
will	too	become	increasingly	important.	Platforms	with	no	formal
governance	may	not	be	acceptable	to	some	users.	A	public	ledger	called
Hadera	Hashgraph	is	experimenting	with	having	a	formal	governance
structure	over	a	public	and	accessible	distributed	ledger.
Private	blockchains	will	be	adopted	by	businesses,	perhaps	first	in	small
groups	for	specific	uses,	and	then	sooner	or	later	they	will	come	together
to	form	larger	networks,	just	as	the	internet	was	formed	from	individual
to	form	larger	networks,	just	as	the	internet	was	formed	from	individual
private	networks.
Assets	and	records	represented	digitally	will	change	ownership	at	the
speed	of	email	with	fewer	steps	and	costs.	We	will	learn	how	to	use	this
technology	to	move	documents	across	organisational	boundaries—
invoices,	purchase	orders,	packing	lists,	certificates	of	origin,	certificates
of	guarantee,	health	records,	rental	agreements…	the	list	goes	on.	These
documents	are	assets	that	can	all	be	represented	as	tokens	on	distributed
ledgers,	with	much	stronger	authenticity	guarantees	due	to	the	use	of
digital	signatures.	Many	digital	documents	should	only	be	represented
once,	with	the	right	parties	having	visibility	into	the	latest	version.
Whether	between	or	within	organisations,	when	data	sets	need	to	be
passed	from	one	system	to	another,	the	receiving	system	needs	to	be
confident	that	it	has	the	complete	set	of	data,	and	the	data	hasn’t	been
corrupted	in	the	process.	This	situation	happens	a	lot	in	banking—often
huge	lists	of	trades	need	to	be	sent	from	one	system	to	another.	Often,
there	is	a	process,	called	a	control	process,	that	reconciles	the	data
between	the	sending	and	receiving	system.	This	reconciliation	is	yet
another	process	that	needs	to	be	set	up	and	monitored.	But	if	the	trades
can	be	recorded	and	sent	with	a	reference,	a	hash,	to	a	previous	trade	in
the	set,	then	the	receiving	system	can	know	for	sure	both	that	it	has	the
complete	set
	of	trades,	and	that	the	data	
within	the	trades
	has	not	been
altered	by	accident	or	malice.	This	means	that	a	receiving	system	may	be
confident	about	the	completeness	and	accuracy	of	data	received,	without
performing	a	reconciliation	against	the	sending	system.
In	the	future,	it	will	make	little	sense	to	manage	any	document	or	data	set
that	needs	to	cross	organisational	boundaries	using	anything	other	than	a
blockchain.
These	improvements	will	increase	the	velocity	of	business	done	within
These	improvements	will	increase	the	velocity	of	business	done	within
countries	and	across	borders.	This	has	a	huge	impact	not	only	for	the
financial	services	industry,	which	is	mostly	about	the	movement	of	assets,
but	also	for	the	real	economy.
Smart	contracts	will	enable	business-to-business	automation	in	a
guaranteed	way	that	hasn’t	been	possible	before.	Automation	has	tended
to	stop	at	the	boundaries	of	businesses,	with	each	business	checking	that
the	other	one	has	performed	according	to	the	rules	of	the	particular	deal.
With	smart	contracts,	these	rules	can	be	automated	and	validated
automatically,	so	duplicative	processes	can	be	made	much	more	efficient,
even	eliminated.
Blockchains	enable	
atomic
	transactions,	transactions	that	make	multiple
changes	to	the	ledger	simultaneously	or	not	at	all.	Atomic,	because	the
changes	are	bundled	together	and	indivisible.	If	two	banks	are	engaging
in	a	trade,	perhaps	one	is	buying	a	bond	from	another,	two	things
happen:	the	bond	changes	ownership	and	the	cash	changes	ownership.
These	transactions	currently	occur	on	separate	ledgers,	and	one	leg	can
fail	while	the	other	succeeds.	This	creates	an	operational	risk	that	can
lead	to	financial	disaster
247
.	On	a	blockchain,	an	atomic	transaction	can	be
created	that	includes	both	changes	of	ownership,	the	cash	and	the	bond.
That	transaction	is	committed	in	its	entirety,	and	either	succeeds	as	a
whole	or	fails.	In	finance	this	concept	is	called	‘delivery	vs	payment,’	and
historically	we	have	paid	agents	to	guarantee	this.	Blockchain	technology
now	provides	the	
technological
	means	to	do	this.	This	itself	has	the
capacity	to	make	entire	business	ecosystems	operate	more	smoothly	with
less	risk,	while	removing	the	need	to	pay	third	parties	to	perform	the
escrow	service.
There	are	some	potential	uses	for	‘special	purpose	money,’	for	example,
grants	or	charity	contributions	that	may	legitimately	end	up	in	only
grants	or	charity	contributions	that	may	legitimately	end	up	in	only
certain	pre-agreed	accounts.	This	has	social	and	economic	implications
and	we	will	need	to	learn	how	to	use	these	tools	ethically.
At	first,	private	blockchains	will	be	used	to	do	the	same	kind	of	business
as	today	but	better,	faster,	and	cheaper.	They	will	improve	
how
businesses	interact.	Later,	there	will	be	a	shift,	and	industries	will	start	to
evolve	their	processes.	They	will	improve	
what
	businesses	do.
Intermediaries	who	were	once	necessary	will	be	sidestepped	and	their
business	models	made	irrelevant.	This	will	drive	down	transaction	costs
and	return	value	to	the	real	economy.	This	will	follow	a	similar	curve	to
the	adoption	of	desktop	computers	in	businesses	in	the	1980s.	First	they
were	used	to	automate	existing	processes	for	individuals,	then	people
began	to	see	a	whole	new	world	of	potential	opening	up.
The	financial	services	industry	is	particularly	at	risk	of	disruption	from
this	technology.	Before	blockchains,	third	party	intermediaries	were
needed	to	keep	track	of	digital	assets.	The	ledger	containing	your	money
is	controlled	by	your	bank;	the	ledger	containing	your	shares	is	in	the
hands	of	your	share	custodian.	You’ve	never	been	able	to	digitally	own
and	directly	control	a	financial	asset:	it	has	always	been	kept	by	a	third
party.	The	financial	services	industry	is	full	of	intermediaries	who	hold
your	assets.	They	are	the	ones	who	keep	track	of	who	owns	what,	and	it	is
their	job	to	prevent	double	spending.	And	they	are	rewarded	handsomely
for	doing	so,	a	cost	you	bear.	However,	with	cryptoassets	you	really	can
hold	and	control	your	assets,	though	this	has	its	risks.	The	blockchain	is
the	ledger.	So	this	technology	
must
	result	in	fewer	intermediaries,	and
that	is	probably	a	good	thing	overall.	Fewer	financial	intermediaries
means	fewer	businesses	that	extract	profit	from	the	real	economy.
There	is	a	possibility	that	the	distinction	between	public	and	private
blockchains	fades	away,	or	that	assets	can	jump	between	one	blockchain
and	another	with	such	ease	that	the	blockchains	themselves	become	a
and	another	with	such	ease	that	the	blockchains	themselves	become	a
matter	of	preference	and	matter	as	little	as	which	device	you	use	to	check
your	email.
We	have	already	seen	the	start	of	disintermediation.	In	ICOs,	huge	sums
of	money	are	being	transferred	around	the	world	without	a	bank	in	sight.
In	June	2016,	I	personally	helped	to	arrange	the	custody	of	almost
25,000	bitcoins	seized	as	proceeds	of	crime,	worth	$16m	Australian
dollars	at	the	time
248
.	The	bitcoins	were	held	in	custody	by	EY,	a
professional	services	firm,	for	a	month	before	being	transferred	to
winners	of	a	global	auction.	No	bank	was	paid.	No	bank	
needed
	to	be
paid.
Financial	intermediaries	are	scrambling	to	adopt	blockchain	technology
to	figure	how	they	can	evolve	their	business	models	to	work	in	the	new
environment.	Far-sighted	companies	at	risk	of	disruption	are	already
jostling	for	a	position	to	adopt	new	roles	in	the	new	ecosystem.
Whether	you	are	a	proponent	of	public	blockchains	or	private,	whether
you	believe	in	the	long-term	viability	of	specific	cryptocurrencies	or	not,
and	whether	you	think	that	decentralisation	is	a	good	thing	or	not,	this
industry	is	certainly	delivering	for	society	the	most	interesting	and
potentially	radical	instruments	of	change.	Whether	these	tools	will	be
used	for	good	or	for	bad	depends	on	how	the	technology	is	adopted,	by
whom,	and	for	what	purpose.
	
	
	
	

APPENDIX
The Fed The Federal Reserve is not a single
central bank. It is a central banking 
system
.
The system is comprised of three main
parts: twelve regional Federal Reserve
Banks, the Federal Reserve Board, and the
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).
According to Wikipedia:
249
The Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers. It is governed by the presidentially
appointed Board of Governors or Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Twelve regional Federal
Reserve Banks, located in cities throughout the nation, oversee the privately-owned U.S.
member banks. Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in the
Federal Reserve Bank of their region, which entitles them to elect some of their board
members. The FOMC sets monetary policy; it consists of all seven members of the Board of
Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at
any given time: the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-
year terms.
People	talk	about	the	‘big’	Fed	and	the	‘little’	Feds.	When	they	talk	about
the	‘big’	Fed,	they	are	usually	talking	about	either	the	
Board	of	Governors
of	the	Federal	Reserve	System
	(‘The	Board	of	Governors’)	or	the	FOMC.
The	‘little’	Feds	are	the	twelve	regional	Federal	Reserve	Banks.
Big
	
Fed
	
Board	of
	
Governors
	According	to	the	St	Louis	Fed
250
,
the	Board	of	Governors	guides	the	Federal	Reserve’s	policy
actions,	and	consists	of	up	to	seven	governors,	appointed	by
the	president	of	the	United	States	and	confirmed	by	the	Senate.
As	of	Jun	2018,	there	are	only	three	governors	guiding	the
Fed
251
.
Federal	Open	Market
	
Committee
	The	FOMC	is	the	body	that
raises	or	lowers	interest	rates.	The	St	Louis	Fed	describes	the
committee	as:	…	the	Fed’s	chief	body	for	monetary	policy.	Its
voting	membership	combines	the	seven	members	of	the	Board
of	Governors,	the	president	of	the	Federal	Reserve	Bank	of
New	York,	and	four	other	Reserve	Bank	presidents,	who	serve
one-year	terms	on	a	rotating	basis	with	the	other	Reserve	Bank
presidents.
According	to	the	Chicago	Fed:
252
The monetary policy goals of the Federal Reserve are to foster economic conditions that
achieve both stable prices and maximum sustainable employment.
What	does	a	stable	price	mean?	The	target	goal	for	the	FOMC	is	to	set
monetary	policy	to	create	a	2%	per	year	CPI.	2%	seems	small	but	has	a
significant	effect	over	a	lifetime.	The	maximum	stable	employment	rate	is
targeted	at	95.4%	employment,	or	4.6%	unemployment.
The	FOMC	oversees	and	sets	policy	on	open	market	operations,	the
principal	tool	of	national	monetary	policy.	The	committee	meets	eight
times	a	year,	approximately	once	every	six	weeks.	As	of	Jun	2018,	out	of	a
maximum	of	twelve	voting	members,	only	eight	committee	members
were	appointed

Little
	
Feds
	The	‘Little	Feds’	are	the	twelve	separately
incorporated	regional	Federal	Reserve	Banks	(regional	FRBs).
They	are	based	in	the	cities	of	Boston,	New	York,	Philadelphia,
Cleveland,	Richmond,	Atlanta,	Chicago,	St.	Louis,	Minneapolis,
Kansas	City,	Dallas,	and	San	Francisco.
The territories of the Little Feds.

The	regional	FRBs	are	responsible	within	their	territory	for	supervising
and	examining	state	member	banks,	lending	to	depository	institutions,
providing	key	financial	services	(e.g.,	interbank	payment	systems),	and
examining	certain	financial	institutions

Government	with	a	ready	source	of	loans	and	serve	as	the	safe	depository
for	federal	money

The	regional	FRBs	are	not	part	of	the	federal	government	of	the	USA,	but
are	set	up	like	private	corporations,	according	to	the	St	Louis	Fed

shareholders	are	banks	from	the	private	banking	sector,	who	receive	a
tax-free	6%	dividend	from	the	regional	FRBs	in	any	year	that	the	regional
FRB	makes	money.	In	fact,	nationally	chartered	banks	must	purchase

About the Author
Inspired	by	a	Bitcoin	conference	in	2013,	Antony	left	a	conventional
banking	career	in	Singapore	to	join	a	little	startup	called	itBit.	A	Bitcoin
exchange,	itBit	is	a	website	where	clients	can	buy	and	sell	bitcoins,	and
was	one	of	the	first	wave	of	venture	capital	funded	companies	in	the
nascent	cryptocurrency	industry.
In	2015,	after	itBit	raised	another	round	of	venture	funding	and	moved
its	headquarters	to	New	York,	Antony	left	and	privately	consulted	to
clients,	writing	papers	and	running	workshops	to	explain	this	new
technology	to	curious	professionals.
In	2016,	Antony	joined	R3,	a	financial	industry	consortium	created	to
collaboratively	explore	the	benefits	of	blockchain	technology.	As	Director
of	Research,	he	explores	explains	the	evolving	concepts	and	technologies
to	clients,	policymakers,	and	the	public.
Before	becoming	obsessed	with	bitcoins	and	blockchains,	Antony	was	a
technologist	at	Credit	Suisse	in	London	and	Singapore,	having	started	his
banking	career	as	an	FX	spot	trader	at	Barclays	Capital	in	2007.
Antony	studied	Natural	Sciences	at	Gonville	&	Caius	College,	Cambridge
University	where	he	gained	two	full	Blues	for	sailing	and	graduated	in
2004	with	a	2:1.
Antony	lives	in	Singapore	with	his	wife	Sarah	and	their	two	children.	He

In this book I try to use ‘Bitcoin’ (with a capital B) when describing the concept, the
idea, or the network, and ‘bitcoin’ (with a lowercase b) or BTC when describing the units
of currency, the coins themselves. So: ‘I bought 5 bitcoins (or BTC) and saw the
transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain’.

I once paid for a few nights’ accommodation in San Francisco by making a bitcoin
payment to the landlord. It was much easier, cheaper, and faster than asking for bank
details and making an international payment. But then we both use bitcoins. In fact, for
international payments within the cryptocurrency community, it’s much easier, cheaper,
and faster to pay each other in cryptocurrency than with bank wires.

Note though that if the majority of the Bitcoin community agrees, the creation rate
and maximum number of BTC can all be changed. As there is no central or formal
governance, the rules can be changed according to the community’s preferences, though
it is hard to push through contentious changes unless there is wide support. See the
section on cryptocurrency forks.

Actually, there is an entity called the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), which
is a kind of Central Bank’s Central Bank, but it facilitates country to country sovereign
payments such as war reparation payments (money paid by the loser to the winner to
cover damage caused during the war), rather than commercial payments arising from the
private sector.

Note: There is a difference between a 
branch
 and a 
subsidiary
. A branch is a foreign
company operating in a country (not locally incorporated) whereas a subsidiary is a local
incorporated company that is owned by a foreign company. Really confusingly, ‘Citibank
N.A. London Branch’ is a 
subsidiary
 of Citibank N.A., not a 
branch
, even though it has
‘London Branch’ in its name. This is presumably because of historical reasons.

Censorship resistance is extremely important in a world where nation states are
overextending their roles in monitoring and censoring personal activities, including
private financial transactions. While some people think it is ok that governments should
be able to have insight and control over every single aspect of our private lives, they are
fortunate to live in countries where governments are currently benign. Financial privacy
and censorship resistance is extremely important, globally. Financial institutions are
tools used by governments to enact their policies. One example of this is the
weaponising of finance is via financial messaging network SWIFT: although SWIFT claims
to be neutral a non-political cooperative based in Belgium, it is routinely pressured by
various governments to cut off countries from the global financial network, and it obeys.
This is a characteristic of centralised systems
—
there is always someone to pressure, to
throw in prison or exclude if they disobey. While we mostly all agree that terrorism,
however you define it, is a bad thing and cutting off terrorists’ funds is a good thing, it is
possible for regimes to use the same methods to freeze the bank accounts of, say,
homosexuals, immigrants, or other groups or individuals out of favour
—
far less obviously
a use of power for the general public good.

Bitcoin addresses are more secure in some respects than bank accounts. It is
inadvisable to make bank account details known, as Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson
found out in 2008. He printed his bank details in a newspaper called The Sun to try to
make the point that his bank account details could only be used by others to receive
payments, not make them. He was proven wrong and his details were used to set up a
£500 direct debit from his account. The perpetrator had some ethics and used a charity
as the beneficiary. Mr Clarkson subsequently ate his words (an unusual occurrence) See

And yes, this means that blockchains aren’t immutable, contrary to some
commentary.
86
 
Technically the hash function is performed on a 
subset
 of the block’s data, called the
block header, which itself includes hashes of the transactions contained within the block.
87
 
There are other rules too that determine a ‘valid’ block, such as its size in bytes, but
the proof-of-work hash is what we focus on here.

Nowadays, special chips known as ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) are
designed, built, and used specifically for this mining task. ASICs built for this purpose are
very efficient at SHA-256 hashing but pretty much useless for anything else. So any
comparisons between the amount of (very specific) calculations that Bitcoin miners can
do per second, compared with the world’s supercomputers (that can do general purpose
computing), is not comparing like for like and therefore a false comparison.

These attacks are named after Sybil Dorsett, the pseudonymous subject of a 1973

disorder.
92
 
The way this works in practice is that when Alice creates a transaction, she can
specify that the transaction pays the recipient slightly less than the amount that is
deducted from her account. In jargon, her transaction outputs is less than her inputs.
This difference is the fee for the miner. The miner adds up the fees from all the
transactions in the block and includes it in the ‘coinbase’ transaction which is a
transaction paid to the miner and is described later.
93
 
But now it is a little more complicated, with innovations such as Segregated
Witnesses where part of the data in the block isn’t counted towards the block’s size.
94
 
Not to be confused with a cryptocurrency wallet company based in the USA called
Coinbase.

97
 
The ‘consensus mechanism’ in Bitcoin is not proof-of-work (as a lot of people say),
it’s the longest chain rule (or to be pedantic, it’s the chain with the most work done on
it, which normally equates to the most blocks). Showing a proof-of-work proof is the
Sybl-resistant data entry mechanism, i.e., the entry price of being able to add a block,
but the mechanism that is used to determine which chain of blocks commands
consensus is the longest chain rule.
98
 
In blockchains like bitcoin, transactions are never completely settled. There is a
probability that a longer chain exists somewhere and is adopted by the network. This
means that cryptocurrency payments are settled probabilistically rather than
deterministically. The deeper your transaction in the blockchain, the more probable it is
that it won’t be usurped by a longer chain.
99
 
As an extreme precaution, miners have to wait 100 blocks before they can spend the
special coinbase block reward they get from mining. This is called the 
coinbase maturity.
100
 
See 
http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/11/04/bitcoin-is-broken/

Actually, because a transaction can contain multiple payments, you need to refer to
the transaction’s hash and the specific payment into your address.

An easy way to understand a 2-of-3 key split is by considering a straight line on a
graph. Let’s say the point at which the line crosses the x-axis is the private key. You can
pick any 3 points on the line. Any single point will not give you any information at all
about where the line crosses the x-axis, but any two points will lock down the line and
tell you exactly where it crosses the x-axis.

Technically these are ‘P2SH’ or ‘Pay to Script Hash’ addresses, but most people call

Up or down? It could be either: any indication that the coins are being sold could
cause a panic that Satoshi no longer believes in the project, but conversely, if the coins
were sent to a ‘burn’ address that effectively renders the coins to be immobile, this
would take the supply off the market, which could lead to increased confidence and a
price increase.

The Gini coefficient is a metric used to describe wealth inequality in a population. It
is a number from 0 to 1, where 0 means everyone has the same wealth and the number
tends towards 1 as inequality increases.

ERC-20 is a set of technical standards for designing smart contracts on Ethereum
that hold fungible tokens. Tokens compliant with ERC-20 have well-known interfaces
and properties, meaning that they can be easily added by exchanges and wallets.
Superior standards exist but remain compatible with ERC-20. JP Buntinx describes the
idea in The Merkle: 
https://themerkle.com/what-is-the-erc20-ethereum-token-
standard/
193
 
In another respect, cryptoassets are not bearer assets, because they are recorded on
a register – the blockchain! Traditionally an asset is a bearer asset (she who holds it
owns it) or a registered asset (she whose name is on a list owns it). Cryptoassets are
somewhere in between.

Note that ‘top’ is roughly defined by ‘market cap,’ i.e., token price times number of
tokens outstanding. Top doesn’t mean good. I do not endorse any of these, nor do I think
they are all legitimate. By the time you read this it will be out of date.

The conflation between success and disruption is one viewpoint that seems to be
common in technology and innovation hubs. However, there are many routes to success.
Success can equally be derived from creating technologies that incrementally improve
business-as-usual company operations.

This is the USD value of the fundraises at the time of fundraise. As we will see later,
the funding currency is usually cryptocurrency, usually bitcoins or ether. It is up to the
projects to decide how they manage their received funds, and most balance between
keeping some in cryptocurrency and some in fiat.
221
 
NB Sometimes there is no company, there is just a project or venture that controls a
cryptocurrency address that can receive funds. Whereas with banks you have to be
explicit with the owner of the bank account, there is no such requirement for creating
cryptocurrency addresses on public networks.
222
 
We can argue about what to call participants who contribute to ICOs. I call them
investors, because at the very least they are invested in the success of the project,
whether they hope to financially profit from their investment, or hope to be able to use
the eventual product or service.

Sometimes other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are used, but Ethereum has

On the subject of e-sports, some people mock or bully those who watch other
people playing computer games, or those who dress up for fun as their favourite
characters. Often these same people will themselves watch other people kick a ball
around on some grass, dress up as their favourite footballer, sing songs, and pretend to
be them.

A famous case was that of Bank Herstatt. Bank Herstatt was a German bank that
engaged in foreign exchange trades. On 26 June 1974 it received Deutsche marks from a
number of trading counterparties, who expected US dollars in return later in the day
when the US markets operated. However, the bank went bankrupt before the US dollars
were transferred, so the counterparties were left short of US dollars having paid out
Deutsche marks. This led to the creation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,
famous for ‘Basel requirements,’ and CLS.
