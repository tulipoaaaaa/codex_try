This report provides an overview of the global 
crypto hedge fund landscape and offer insights 
into both quantitative elements (such as liquidity 
terms, trading of cryptocurrencies, and 
performance) and qualitative aspects, such as best 
practice with respect to custody and governance. 
By sharing these insights with the broader crypto 
industry, PwC’s goal is to encourage the adoption 
of sound practices by market participants as the 
ecosystem matures. 
For this 3rd annual edition, PwC have partnered 
with the Alternative Investment Management 
Association (AIMA) to also survey some of the 
non-crypto focused hedge funds (referred to as 
‘traditional’ hedge funds in this report). The data on 
these traditional hedge funds is provided in the 
second part of this report.

Key takeaways
We estimate that the total assets under management (AuM) of 
crypto hedge funds globally increased to nearly US$3.8 billion 
in 2020 from US$2 billion the previous year. 
The percentage of crypto hedge funds with AuM over US$20 
million increased in 2020 from 35% to 46%. 
The average AuM for this year’s surveyed funds increased from 
US$12.8 million to US$42.8 million, while the median AuM
increased from US$3.8 million to US$15.0 million. 
The median AuM at fund launch is US$1 million, indicating that 
funds have generally seen an impressive 15X increase in AuM.
1
Size of the market and AuM
The median crypto hedge fund returned +128% in 2020 (vs 
+30% in 2019).
The median best performance strategy in 2020 was 
discretionary long only (+294%) followed by discretionary 
long-short (+129%), multi-strategy (+114%) and quant (+72%).
Median management and performance fees remained 
unchanged at 2% and 20% respectively, average management 
fees was also stable, at 2.3%, but average performance fees 
increased from 21.1% to 22.5%.
49% of crypto hedge funds have either a hard or soft lock and 
31% have either an investor level or fund level gate. 
2
Performance and fees
The vast majority of investors in crypto hedge funds are either 
high-net worth individuals (54%) or family offices (30%). 
The median ticket size is US$0.4 million, while the average 
ticket size is US$1.1 million. 
Over half of crypto hedge funds have average ticket sizes of 
US$0.5 million and below.
Crypto hedge funds have a median of 23 separate investors.

3rd Annual Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report 2021
The most common crypto hedge fund strategy is quantitative (37% of funds), 
followed by discretionary long/short (28%), discretionary long-only (20%), and 
multi-strategy (11%).
Most crypto hedge funds trade Bitcoin ‘BTC’ (92%) followed by Ethereum ‘ETH’ 
(67%), Litecoin ‘LTC’ (34%), Chainlink ‘LINK’ (30%), Polkadot ‘DOT’ (28%) and 
Aave ‘AAVE’ (27%).
About half of crypto hedge funds trade derivatives (56%), but short-selling has 
drastically reduced, from 48% to 28% in 2020. Crypto hedge funds are also 
involved in cryptocurrency staking (42%), lending (33%) and borrowing (24%).
4
Fund strategies, activities and trading
The percentage of crypto hedge funds using an independent custodian 
decreased in 2020 from 81% to 76%.
The percentage with at least one independent director on their board decreased 
from 43% to 38% in 2020.
The percentage of crypto hedge funds using third party research increased from 
38% to 47% in 2020.
88% were using an independent fund administrator in 2020, up from 86% in 2019.
5
Governance
Funds tend to be domiciled in the same jurisdictions as traditional hedge funds, 
with the top three being the Cayman Islands (34%), the United States (33%) 
and Gibraltar (9%).
The most common location for crypto hedge fund managers is the United States 
(43%), followed by the United Kingdom (19%) and Hong Kong (11%).
6
Location
Around a fifth of hedge funds are investing in digital assets (21%); the average 
percentage of their total hedge fund AuM invested in digital assets is 3%. More 
than 85% of those hedge funds intend to deploy more capital into the asset 
class by the end of 2021.
Around a quarter of hedge fund managers who are not yet investing in digital 
assets confirmed that they are in late-stage planning to invest or looking to 
invest (26%).
In terms of the main obstacles to investing, regulatory uncertainty is by far the 
greatest barrier (82%). Even those who do invest in digital assets cite it as a 
major challenge (50%). Client reaction/reputational risk is high (77%) as well as 
digital assets being outside the scope of current investment mandates (68%). 
Over half of the respondents said that they don’t have enough knowledge of 
digital assets (64%).
64% of respondents said that if the main barriers were to be removed they 
would definitely start/accelerate their involvement/investment or potentially 
change their approach and become more involved.

Non-crypto focused (traditional hedge funds)

This chapter comes from research that was 
conducted in Q1 2021 across the largest global 
crypto hedge funds by assets under 
management (AuM). This section specifically 
focuses on crypto hedge funds and excludes 
data from crypto index/tracking/passive funds 
and crypto venture capital funds.
Crypto hedge funds

3rd Annual Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report 2021

This report shares the results of survey-
based research conducted in Q1 2021 by 
Elwood Asset Management, combined with 
qualitative inputs on sound practices 
observed within the crypto hedge fund space 
from PwC’s crypto team. The report focuses 
on actively managed crypto hedge funds 
which invest/trade in liquid, public 
cryptocurrencies and other instruments. 
This report excludes:
•
Crypto index funds (including 
passive/tracker funds); and
•
Crypto venture capital funds (which make 
equity type investments).
The report excludes exchange-traded funds 
‘ETFs’ and access products.
Given the focus of the report, there were 
certain participants in the survey whose data 
we needed to exclude from the final results, 
as our research showed they were not 
actively managed crypto hedge funds as 
described above. 
While most crypto hedge funds provided 
responses to all the survey questions
some were not in a position to provide 
information on certain topics/questions. 
However, all data analysed in this report is 
based on information provided by a majority 
of the funds that Elwood surveyed. 
There is an inherent element of survivorship 
bias in the fund universe surveyed, as the 
report only includes crypto hedge funds that 
were in operation in Q1 2021. Funds that 
were forced to shut down prior to this date 
due to the difficult market conditions of 2019 
and early 2020 have been excluded. The 
data provided in this report, including 
performance data, has also not been verified 
by an independent fund administrator or 
other third party, but was provided by the 
crypto hedge fund managers directly.
Finally, all participants were asked to give 
consent to Elwood Asset Management and 
PwC for their name to be shared in the report. 
Some firms requested that their name not be 
shared. Those which have given their 
consent are listed in alphabetical order in the 
appendix. However, individual firms have not 
been linked to any specific comment or data 
point.

3rd Annual Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report 2021
Launch of new crypto hedge funds appears correlated to the price of Bitcoin
As shown by the graph above, the launch of 
actively managed crypto funds is highly 
correlated with the price of Bitcoin (BTC). 
The price spike in 2018 appears to have 
been a catalyst for further crypto funds to 
launch, while the decrease in 2018 led to 
fewer funds being launched in 2019. 18% of 
the survey respondents were launched in 
2020, when prices were rising again.
We have classified crypto hedge funds 
according to four broad fund strategies:
•
Discretionary Long Only: Funds which 
are long only and whose investors have a 
longer investment horizon. These funds 
tend to invest in early stage token/coin 
projects, and they also buy and hold more 
liquid cryptocurrencies. These funds tend 
to have the longest lock-up periods for 
investors.
•
Discretionary Long/Short: Funds which 
cover a broad range of strategies 
including: long/short, relative value, event 
driven, technical analysis and some 
strategies which are crypto specific, such 
as mining. Discretionary funds often have 
hybrid strategies which can include 
investing in early stage projects. They 
tend to have a similar lock-up period to 
the Discretionary long only group.

•
Quantitative: Funds taking a quantitative 
approach to the market in either a 
directional or a market neutral manner. 
Indicative strategies include: market-
making, arbitrage and low latency trading. 
Liquidity is key for these strategies and 
restricts these funds to only trading more 
liquid cryptocurrencies. As a result, these 
funds typically have the shortest lock-up 
periods for investors.
•
Multi-strategy: Funds adopting a 
combination of the above strategies. For 
instance, within the limitations set in the 
prospectus of a particular fund, traders 
may manage discretionary long/short and 
quantitative sub-accounts.
Assuming our dataset is representative of 
the total crypto hedge fund universe, we 
conclude that quantitative funds are the most 
common among crypto hedge funds, making 
up for just over a third of all currently active 
crypto funds. 
The next two larger categories are 
discretionary long/short (28%) and 
discretionary long only (20%), with multi-
strategy funds making up a much smaller 
proportion, at 11%.

Looking at the market for crypto hedge funds, we identified High-net worth 
individuals ‘HNWIs as the most common investor type in crypto hedge funds, 
with more than half of funds mentioning them as the most common investor type. 
Family offices come second (30%) and funds of funds, a distant third (4%). 
Although institutions have been aggressively ploughing into cryptocurrency 
markets, they are not yet prevalent investors in crypto hedge funds, with only 
one fund in our sample mentioning them as their main investor type and the top 
spots still dominated by HNWIs and family offices. Going forward, it is expected 
that this mix in the investor base while gradually change with the increased 
levels of interest from institutional investors.

The median number of investors in funds is 23 and the average is 70.1, while 
the median ticket size is US$0.4 million and the average is US$1.1 million. The 
graph below shows the distribution of the average ticket size and suggests that 
half of funds have tickets below US$0.5 million.

We estimate that the total AuM of crypto hedge funds globally 
increased to over US$3.8 billion in 2020, just over US$2 billion 
in the previous year. This data is based on the AuM responses 
given to us by the surveyed fund managers with certain 
adjustments due to some funds having not disclosed their total 
AuM.
The graph below shows the distribution of AuM held by 
individual crypto hedge funds. Although there are many smaller 
funds, assets are still highly concentrated among the largest 
hedge funds. Our survey showed that the top-10 largest crypto 
hedge funds control 63% of total AuM.

Also, the effect of the 2020 crypto bull market is clearly visible in 
the data above, with the number of funds with smaller AuMs
being considerably lower in 2019 than in 2020, while, at the 
other end of the spectrum, the number of funds managing larger 
amounts of assets is considerably higher in 2020.

The table above shows a breakdown of the performance by investment strategy. On a 
median basis, quantitative long/short funds have considerably underperformed other 
strategies (72%), while discretionary long only out on top (294%). This is not surprising 
considering the market rally that took place in the fourth quarter of 2020.

2020 year-end crypto hedge fund performance by strategies 
Overall, the crypto hedge funds in our 
sample had a median performance of 184% 
last year, vastly higher than 2019 (17%) and, 
while different strategies have yielded 
different levels of performance, neither was
able to outperform BTC itself, which went up 
305% during 2020. A similar picture can be 
drawn from 2019 data, when our sample had 
a median performance of 17%, against the 
BTC rally of 95% in that year.

2020 vs 2019 crypto hedge fund median performance by strategy 
Our data also suggests that, while 
discretionary long-only funds were not able 
to capitalise on the 2019 cryptocurrency 
market recovery, lagging behind other 
strategies, they performed exceptionally well 
in the 2020 bull market. On the other hand, 
long-short underperformed, as one would 
expect bearish bets to do in a heated market.
Finally, it is important to note that, while the 
chart above does show funds 
underperforming their main benchmark, we 
are not able to tell whether they were able to 
offer higher or lower volatility in relation to 
cryptocurrencies, which could make crypto 
hedge funds more attractive investment 
propositions, despite the lower returns.

3rd Annual Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report 2021
Crypto hedge fund management and 
performance fees
Median fees were the same as 2019: a 2% 
management fee with a 20% performance fee. Average 
management fees remained the same (2.3%) but the 
average performance fee increased (from 21.1% to 
22.5%). The slight increase in performance fees can be 
simply attributable to the fact that fund managers were 
able to command higher performance fees in a bull 
market.
Going forward, we expect funds to incur higher costs, 
as regulations are likely to become more stringent and 
investors demand higher institutional set-ups. However, 
the growing number of funds, as we saw in 2020, is 
likely to increase competitive pressures between 
managers, which would eventually seek to lower their 
fees in order to attract new clients, especially 
institutional investors. As a result, investors are likely to 
benefit from increased investment options, while funds 
are likely to have their profits squeezed by lower 
margins and increased competition.

3rd Annual Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report 2021
Despite the slight increase in management fees, crypto 
funds will still find it challenging to break even, unless 
they are able to attract enough investors, keeping in 
mind that the median crypto hedge fund in 2020 had 
US$15 million in AuM.
To illustrate this point, if the median crypto fund 
manages US$15 million and charges a 2% 
management fee, then they have US$300,000 in annual 
revenue. This is unlikely to be sufficient to sustain a 
business operation, especially considering that the 
median fund has a payroll with six employees. As a 
result, some funds are exploring ways to increase their 
income in order to cover costs. For example, we have 
seen quantitative long/short funds diversify their 
approach and start market making, and early-stage 
focused funds take on advisory roles for new projects, 
while other funds seek to raise additional capital by 
selling stakes in their General Partner (GP). Some 
funds remain focused on their core strategy and hope to 
cover costs via the performance fee. In 2020, this would 
have been extremely successful, as the median fund 
returned 128% and would have been able to generate 
an additional US$3.8m in income, assuming the above 
mentioned median AuM. While this approach looks 
positive at first, the downside is that managers may be 
inclined to take additional risks, especially towards 
year-end if they are still under their high-water mark.

Looking at how crypto hedge funds are using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies other than 
for investment purposes, we asked whether they stake, lend or borrow digital assets.
The activities listed below were highlighted by the funds.

Among the top 15 traded altcoins, some of 
them are considerably more popular than 
their market capitalisation would suggest. 
Litecoin and Chainlink are the second and 
third most traded altcoins, but their market 
capitalisations are far lower than Polkadot
and Cardano, which fare lower in the 
trading ranks. Aave, the fifth most traded 
altcoin by hedge funds, has a market 
capitalisation of US$5 billion, compared to 
Cardano’s US$48 billion, which ranks one 
position below it.

Looking at daily trading activity attributed to 
BTC, 56% of the funds in our survey 
reported that at least half of their daily 
cryptocurrency trading volume is BTC, while 
15% of funds are pure Bitcoin funds and 
trade only BTC.
We also asked funds to name their top 
traded altcoins by daily volume (stablecoins
were excluded). We found that the top five 
were: Ethereum (ETH, 67%), Litecoin (LTC, 
34%), Chainlink (LINK, 30%), Polkadot (DOT, 
28%) and Aave (AAVE, 27%).

Crypto hedge funds and shorting
Derivatives can either be used as hedging or alpha-enhancing 
instruments. 2020 was a very busy year in this space. Bitcoin futures 
open interest saw a substantial rise, indicating increasing institutional 
interest in cryptocurrencies. As a result, existing derivatives exchanges 
sought to enrich their offerings, while a number of new players entered 
this space, leading to a decrease in the concentration of trading volume 
distribution between exchanges. Towards the end of the year, Bitcoin 
futures notional trading volumes exploded and trading currently includes  
billions of US dollars per day, up from hundreds of millions a year ago. 
The increased number of players and liquidity is rapidly transforming 
the cryptocurrency derivatives market, enabling widespread institutional 
adoption, which will, in turn, allow exchanges to offer more 
sophisticated products, further allowing crypto hedge funds to take 
advantage of mispricing and arbitrage opportunities.

Changes in risk management policy after 
the March 2020 crypto market crash
Our 2020 data shows that more than half of the surveyed funds use 
derivatives, with options being the most commonly used tool (31%). 
However, in contrast with our previous survey, funds are taking less 
short positions, with only 28% stating they actively short 
cryptocurrencies. This is consistent with the extremely bullish views in 
this market, especially from Q4 2020 and into Q1 2021, when the 
survey was conducted.
In March 2020, Bitcoin crashed to US$4,904, 53% below its intra-year 
peak of US$10,344 in February. The drop was particularly abrupt on the 
week of 9th of March, when prices collapsed by 27% in a single day. 
In light of this event, we asked the crypto hedge funds whether they put 
new risk management policies in place. Most funds (61%) stated that no 
changes had been made, with some funds mentioning that they already 
had risk management systems in place. Among the funds that did 
implement new policies, the most common was establishing 
counterparty or exchange due diligence so as to not be exposed to 
events such as the one described above. Others implemented a formal 
counterparty risk management policy and changes in management 
techniques.

Crypto hedge funds and leverage
In bull markets, managers are likely to 
compound their returns by increasing 
leverage and taking larger exposure to their 
underlying positions. Our data shows that 
about half (51%) of funds are allowed to use 
leverage and, although we are seeing a rise 
in financial institutions offering 
cryptocurrency collateralised loans, several 
obstacles remain in order for it to become 
more widespread (e.g. high collateral 
requirements, inherent risk, price volatility). 
As a result, only 27% of crypto hedge funds 
actively use leverage, up from 19% in 2019.

3rd Annual Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report 2021
Decentralised finance (DeFi) had 
extraordinary growth in 2020 and was the 
year’s buzzword within the cryptocurrency 
community. DeFi protocols aim to render 
peer-to-peer financial services, which allow 
cryptocurrency trading, loans, interest 
accounts without the use of traditional banks 
and traditional financial intermediaries.
Last summer, DeFi started booming and, 
between April 2020 and April 2021, the 
trading volume on these platforms grew 
more than 90-fold, with Uniswap making up 
for half of the DeFi market volume in April 
2021.

Distribution of Bitcoin price predictions for the end of 2021
This year, we gave crypto hedge fund 
managers the opportunity to provide their 
views on where the price of Bitcoin and 
overall cryptocurrency market capitalisation
would be on 31 December 2021. 
Our data shows that managers remain 
bullish on Bitcoin. At the time of the closure 
of our survey, the Bitcoin price was hovering 
around US$59,000, and all but one 
respondent predicted a value higher than 
that, with the median predicted price being 
US$100,000. In fact, the majority of 
predictions were in the US$50,000 to 
US$100,000 range (65%), with another 21% 
predicting prices would be between 
US$100,000 and US$150,000.
Outlook or Fund manager predictions
With regards to the total cryptocurrency 
market capitalisation, by the time we closed 
our survey, the crypto market was worth 
approximately US$2 trillion. Fund managers 
are also bullish, with over 76% of funds

Change in crypto hedge fund average team size and cumulative years 
of investment management experience
In 2020, the average size of the investment 
teams marginally decreased from 8.7 to 7.6 
people, while the average number for 
cumulative years of investment management 
experience has increased from 50 to 60. 
This suggests that there is an increasing 
number of experienced investment 
professionals entering into this space, thus 
leading to financially savvier crypto fund 
teams. But it is possible that there may also 
be survivorship bias where crypto funds that 
closed during the previous year had a higher 
proportion of junior staff. Additionally, it could 
also mean that newer funds are being 
established that had fewer but more 
experienced staff at the initial stage. 
We expect this trend to continue where we 
see experienced finance professionals enter 
the crypto space as the industry evolves and 
matures.
An investment team with ‘traditional’ asset 
management experience will likely give 
investors, as well as regulators, greater 
confidence that the fund is being managed in 
a professional and compliant manner.
Experienced, non-investment professionals 
are also critical for the smooth running of the 
fund and its operational set-up. For example, 
a Chief Operating Officer (COO) or Head of 
Compliance with years of experience in the 
‘traditional’ asset management world will be 
well-versed in applicable rules and 
regulations and the importance of investor 
protection. As previously mentioned, due to 
the particular nature of crypto assets, having 
a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) with a 
strong tech background is often essential.

3rd Annual Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report 2021
Compared to 2019, we have seen a 
continued increase in the cumulative years 
of team/blockchain experience, in particular 
it has grown from 16 to 21 years. We expect 
this number to grow as individuals continue 
to gain more experience in this niche field 
and as funds increasingly seek to hire 
individuals with deep crypto and blockchain 
experience (e.g., researchers, consultants, 
engineers). This is likely to give funds 
competitive edge, a better understanding of 
a fast changing and complex market. 
Percentage of crypto hedge funds using third party research
In 2019, our data showed that 38% of the 
funds surveyed used third party research. 
While funds may have historically relied 
heavily on proprietary valuation models, third 
party research in recent years have become 
more available as the industry continues to 
grow.
This year, our data shows a near 10% 
increase in the number of funds using third-
party research. This may be due to a number 
of factors, such as the growing universe of
crypto assets making it challenging for in-
house teams to cover the whole market 
themselves. Increased number of dedicated 
crypto research providers offering targeted 
research and analysis and managers may 
find it more efficient to outsource certain 
parts of their due diligence process. They 
can then focus their attention and energy on 
specific areas of expertise where they have 
an edge and can generate alpha.

Custody and counterparty risk
In the traditional fund management space, 
using an independent third-party custodian is 
expected. There is a large number of 
established players, from licensed 
custodians to prime brokers, who can take 
custody of fund assets. In crypto, this is not 
as straightforward due to the complexity of 
maintaining private keys, multi-signature 
wallets, hot/cold wallet set-ups or other 
innovative ways to hold the private key of 
fund's crypto assets.
For funds using such a self-custody 
approach, having the in-house technology 
and expertise to design and monitor the self-
custody set-up is also very important.
Compared to the 2019 data, the use of 
independent custodians has decreased 
slightly. 76% of funds are now using one or 
more independent custodians (either third 
party or exchange custodians), down from 
81%.
Whilst it is difficult to determine what is 
causing, we believe that it may be due to the 
increased levels of comfort that many crypto 
hedge funds may have towards their crypto 
exchange and other counterparties. Also, it 
may be due to the increased levels of usage 
of decentralised exchanges.

It is important to remember that crypto 
quant funds traditionally leave their 
assets directly with the various 
exchanges as they trade continuously. 
However, for these quant funds, having 
a well-defined and enforced risk 
management policy is likely to be more 
important than having a custodian. 
Conducting regular counterparty risk 
assessments on these exchanges is 
also becoming important, as 
institutional investors will likely focus on 
this area as part of their operational due 
diligence. 
Given the relevance of these 
developments, it is interesting to 
examine the overall crypto custody 
landscape. From the chart below, we 
can see that there is no ‘market leader’ 
and that the industry is fragmented. Our 
data shows that the most frequently 
named custodian serves only 15% of 
the crypto hedge fund universe in our 
report. While this data weighs each 
fund equally (not factoring in AuM), we 
still consider it relevant as it shows how 
fragmented the custodian ecosystem is.
Some of the larger hedge funds will have 
more than one custodian. There are many 
reasons for this. Some do it for counterparty 
risk management reasons, especially 
considering the increased hacking risks in 
the industry. Others may require a second 
custodian due to their primary choice not 
offering custodial services to their full asset 
list. Unfortunately, onboarding a second 
custodian is not always possible for smaller 
funds due to the minimum monthly fees that 
are added to the fund expenses, which could 
significantly impact their net performance.
We also note that the vast majority of 
custodians used by funds are regulated or 
licensed in some form. This is a positive 
development for the industry and indicates 
the further institutionalisation of the space. In 
addition, a handful of custodians also have 
System and Organisation Controls (SOC) 
reports (or their ISAE 3402 equivalent), 
which are different from financial audits. 
These reports provide a level of 
transparency around financial reporting 
(SOC 1/ISAE 3402) and operational controls 
(SOC 2) and help to build customer trust in 
their risk management framework. We 
expect to see an increase in the number of 
custodians that obtain such public assurance 
reports. This should give comfort not only to 
investors in funds which use these 
custodians but also to the funds’ service 
providers.

Percentage of crypto hedge funds with independent director
Having independent directors on a fund 
board is critical, especially when difficult 
decisions need to be made that will impact 
investors. For example, whether a side 
pocket needs to be set up to hold certain 
assets or whether restrictions need to be 
imposed on investor redemptions. In the 
crypto space, critical decisions are 
exacerbated by volatility issues and illiquid 
assets.
In 2021, we have seen a decline in the 
percentage of crypto hedge funds with an 
independent director on their board from 
43% to 38%. Whilst Whilst difficult to pinpoint 
why this occurred, we believe that it may be 
due to the rising markets in 2020
and the great returns being generated by crypto 
hedge funds which may have made many of the 
investors more forgiving of such requirements. 
As the institutionalisation of the industry continues 
and the de facto requirement by institutional 
investors to have independent directors on the 
boards of the funds, we expect this percentage to 
increase. The wider availability of board directors 
with relevant expertise and knowledge of the 
space will also be a driver of this trend. In the early 
years these candidates were a rare commodity. 
But now, as the industry matures, there are more 
candidates to choose from. This trend is likely to 
have a positive impact on funds’ ability to attract 
institutional investors and is another development 
that should continue as the industry becomes more 
institutionalised.

Percentage of crypto hedge funds using an independent fund administrator
An independently verified Net Asset Value 
(NAV) is a crucial piece of information for 
fund auditors as well as investors, and we 
expect to see more developments in this 
area. We are happy to see that over 88% of 
the crypto hedge funds in our report this year 
use an independent fund administrator.
It is very unlikely that institutional investors 
will select any fund without an independent 
administrator. While this was acceptable in 
the early days of the industry, there is no 
excuse for a crypto hedge fund to calculate 
its own NAV each month. We expect only a 
very restricted number of funds, such as 
those with small AuM or who hold niche 
crypto assets, to be able to value part of their 
portfolio themselves.
Regardless of the choice of fund 
administrator, the valuation policy needs 
particular focus. Most funds will have their 
valuation methodologies and frameworks set 
out in the PPM. It is important for any fund to 
ensure that it complies with what is set out in 
its documentation. Management fees are 
determined based on NAV and performance 
fees are typically charged on NAV 
appreciation over a set period (e.g., above a 
‘high-water-mark’).
Investors expect a monthly NAV to be 
available and verified by an independent, 
reputable fund administrator. Cryptocurrency 
exchanges can provide independent price 
quotes for certain crypto assets. But for 
those portfolios made up of less liquid crypto 
assets, managers may have to source a 
valuation from an independent third-party 
which satisfies the requirements set out in 
the Private Placement Memorandum (PPM).
However, being able to accurately value a 
crypto fund remains challenging. This is 
particularly true for funds that hold illiquid 
tokens or crypto investments via Simple 
Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFTs). 
There are also details that are important for 
funds trading some of the more liquid crypto 
assets, such as: the cut-off time for valuation 
(crypto markets operate 24 hours a day) or 
how many and which price sources to use 
(the same crypto asset may be priced 
differently at different exchanges globally).

Average crypto hedge fund redemption terms by strategy (2020)
The liquidity and lock-up terms of the crypto hedge fund universe are 
largely similar to the previous years. Quant funds provide the most 
liquid fund terms and multi-strategy funds the least. Quant funds trading 
liquid exchange-listed crypto assets can provide better liquidity in 
relation to investments in early-stage projects or multi-strategy funds, 
where managers need to consider the various portfolio strategies and 
instruments ahead of executing trades.
One surprising takeaway is that we are seeing hard locks (where an 
investor is not allowed to redeem until the end of the lock-up period) 
and soft locks (where an investor is allowed to redeem early by paying a 
penalty) being used across the various fund strategies, with nearly a 
third of the funds (31%) having one or the other. 
Although hard locks are commonly used in situations where liquidity 
could be an issue, many liquid quant funds have some in place. Also, it 
may be that some funds were able to negotiate fee reductions via side 
letters in exchange for locking up their capital. As the industry matures 
and becomes more competitive, it will be interesting to see whether new 
crypto hedge fund vintages result in a change in the mix of fund terms 
that we see below.

We have not analysed fund liquidity overall, as each strategy is different 
and has its own liquidity constraints, however we have done an analysis 
of gates.
Gates are a useful mechanism that allow fund directors to put in place 
restrictions in very limited circumstances, which limit the speed at which 
investors can redeem. The main purpose of a gate is not to protect the 
fund manager, but rather the remaining shareholders in the fund, so as 
to ensure that assets do not need to be liquidated in a fire sale solely to 
meet the large number of redemption requests.

There are two main types of gates:
•
Fund-level gates
‐ Triggered only when redemptions are over a certain threshold of the fund 
(e.g. when over 25% of fund NAV or of total number of shares in issue at 
a particular redemption day). 
‐ All investors generally receive their redemptions on a pro-rata basis 
depending on the number of investors redeeming, but the total redemption 
amount is capped (e.g. at 25% of the NAV or total number of shares).
‐ As there is no priority, the scaled-down redemption request will be treated 
on the next redemption day on a pro-rata basis with any new redemption 
requests.
•
Investor-level gates 
‐ Always applied when an investor chooses to redeem (e.g. investors can 
only redeem 25% of their investment each redemption day regardless of 
whether other investors are redeeming at the same time).
Our data shows that the majority of crypto hedge funds have some sort of gate 
mechanism in place. Whether the industry will move towards investor level or 
fund level gates over the coming years is still unclear. 
Fund-level gates may be seen as fairer, as they can only be triggered if a 
certain threshold of redemption requests on a particular redemption day is 
crossed. For example, if there is only one investor redeeming, with limited 
impact on the fund, then there is no reason for a gate to be imposed in the first 
place. The downside for an investor is that they do not know whether their 
redemption request will be fulfilled, which may cause some cash management 
issues if the investor has their own liquidity requirements. Fund-level gates also 
put more pressure on the fund’s board of directors, as they are responsible for 
deciding when to enact the gates.
Investor-level gates can be seen as somewhat favouring the fund manager at 
first glance, as the investor will never be able to redeem his capital in one go, 
but rather over a set number of months, during which time the fund manager will 
continue to collect fees. However, many investors prefer investor-level gates. 
Although they cannot redeem their full investment in one go, they know exactly 
what amount they will receive, which helps their cash flow management.
Generally speaking, investors are now comfortable with both gate mechanisms. 
In practice, the final decision as to which one to put in place is often made after 
consulting with the lead or Day 1 investor on their preference.
We will continue to track this data over the coming years.

Compared to the previous year, the Cayman 
Islands and the United States have 
maintained their position as the top-two 
places where crypto hedge funds are 
domiciled. With that being said, their market 
share has declined overall, from (Cayman 
Islands - 42% to 34%) and (United States -
38% to 33%). We have also seen Gibraltar 
overtaking the BVI and Luxembourg pushing 
down Liechtenstein with the others. 
Our data last year showed that the Cayman 
Islands was the second jurisdiction in terms 
of number of crypto hedge fund managers 
after the United States. However, we believe 
that this data was misleading: despite the 
investment management entity being based 
in the
Cayman Islands, very few of the managers 
were physically based there. 
For this reason, we look to where the 
investment team is physically located. Using 
this new approach, our data shows that two 
thirds of crypto hedge fund managers are 
located in the United States and the United 
Kingdom - two existing financial centers with 
a large number of traditional hedge fund 
managers. A significant number of fund 
managers are also located in Hong Kong 
Gibraltar and Switzerland. 
We would expect this to remain mostly 
constant unless we see particular 
governments or authorities implement come 
up with policies to try and attract such fund 
managers to their jurisdictions.
Legal and regulatory 

A crypto hedge fund and its manager will 
need to consider many of the same tax 
issues that need to be considered when 
structuring, establishing and operating a 
traditional hedge fund and fund manager. 
These include but are not limited to:
•
Choice of fund vehicle and ensuring that 
the fund is set up to be attractive to 
investors with different tax attributes;
‐ If the hedge fund will have non-US and 
US investors, depending on investor 
mix, the relevant structuring 
considerations may span a wider 
spectrum. For instance, considering 
the use of a flow-through entity  versus 
a blocked structure to mitigate double 
taxation and to preserve tax attributes 
of the character of income derived by 
entity, unrelated business taxable 
income considerations for tax-exempt 
investors, and effectively connected 
income considerations for non-US 
investors where applicable.
•
Operating issues with respect to 
contributions, taxable income allocations, 
distributions, transfers, and redemptions;
•
Managing fund and investor tax reporting 
as well as CRS/FATCA and other 
reporting;
•
Consider tax reporting issues based on 
the nature of underlying activities of the 
hedge fund, including the application of 
passive activity rules, deductibility of 
expenses, collateral issues specific to 
various types of investors, wash sale 
rules, straddle rules, short sale rules, 
bond discount and premium 
amortisation, foreign currency 
transaction rules, among others. In 
addition, US investors may face 
various tax issues in the offshore fund 
context including the passive foreign 
investment company and controlled 
foreign corporation rules which are 
designed to prevents avoidance of 
current tax on income and character 
conversion.
•
Understanding the capital gains and 
withholding tax implications of different 
trades (if any);
•
Choice of entity of the fund manager and 
structuring the performance fees or other 
compensation structure used to 
incentivise key staff of the manager;
•
Dealing with transfer pricing between any 
connected entities responsible for 
managing the fund. 
Tax
33
3rd Annual Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report 2021

However, there are a number of areas where 
crypto funds have tax issues that are unique. 
These include:
•
Different and unique sources of 
income/gains - crypto hedge funds can 
have a variety of sources of income that 
may require special considerations from a 
tax perspective (e.g., staking income, 
mining income, token rewards, coin 
lending, hard fork, chain split, and 
airdrops). The taxation of the types of 
crypto and the such income/gains derived 
will often be jurisdiction-specific and, in 
many jurisdictions, the tax treatment is not 
yet clear. The tax characterisation of 
crypto held by hedge funds may evolve 
from initial acquisition throughout the 
holding period until disposal as certain 
events occur. 
•
Fund tax safe-harbours - if the fund is 
established in a different jurisdiction to the 
investment team, then detailed 
consideration will need to be given as to 
whether the activities of the investment 
team could result in tax obligations arising 
for the fund. Many jurisdictions have safe 
harbours in place to prevent funds from 
suffering tax in the location of the 
investment team as a means of 
encouraging the development of their 
local investment management industries. 
In many cases, these exemptions were 
written into law prior to the advent of 
digital assets and therefore there is 
significant uncertainty as to whether many 
safe-harbor regimes or fund exemptions 
can be relied upon for crypto funds. For 
example, regimes such as the UK's 
investment manager exemption,
Hong Kong's unified fund exemption and 
Singapore's fund exemption include lists 
of qualifying investments. Many crypto 
assets (particularly payment tokens and 
utility tokens) may not qualify as 
qualifying investments.
•
Because of these uncertainties, extra care 
is needed, and there may be more 
uncertainty in many of the tax positions 
that crypto funds take on. As the market 
develops and becomes more institutional, 
managers should expect an increased 
focus on this topic from investors.

This year, the Alternative Investment 
Management Association (AIMA) was invited to 
partner on this initiative and provide insights 
into the rising interest in the digital assets 
industry from the perspective of non-crypto 
focused hedge funds (referred to as ‘Traditional’ 
hedge funds in this report). AIMA’s chapter 
within this report looks at whether “traditional” 
hedge funds have investments in digital assets, 
their views on the growing asset class and what 
they believe would be the catalysts for them to 
invest initially and more significantly in digital 
assets.

3rd Annual Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report 2021

This chapter forms part of the ongoing series of annual crypto reports 
conducted by PwC and Elwood Asset Management which commenced in 
2019. This year, the Alternative Investment Management Association 
(AIMA)1  was invited to partner on this initiative and provide insights into 
the rising interest in the digital assets industry. This chapter looks at 
whether “traditional” hedge funds have investments in digital assets, their 
views on the growing asset class and what they believe would be the 
catalysts for them to invest initially and more significantly in digital assets.
The data contained in this chapter comes from a survey that was 
conducted in the first quarter of 2021 with 39 hedge funds that accounted 
for an estimated US$180 billion in Assets Under Management (AuM). More 
than 60% of the responses were from hedge funds who manage assets of 
at least US$1 billion.
Introduction
1 AIMA’s work in digital assets is overseen by its global Digital Assets Working Group (‘AIMA DAWG’). 
This Group is a senior-level industry steering committee tasked with driving AIMA’s regulatory 
engagement, thought-leadership initiatives and operational guidance in the growing area of digital 
assets. It encourages thought-leadership across the industry and shares innovations with market 
participants and regulators to create a feedback loop that encourages the institutionalisation of digital 
assets.

The survey highlights that around a fifth of survey hedge funds are 
currently investing in digital assets (21%). Of those hedge funds who 
invest in digital assets, the average percentage of their total hedge fund 
AuM invested is 3%
Hedge funds active in digital assets that have 10-20% of their portfolio 
invested accounted for 14% of respondents. It is possible that some 
hedge fund managers who initially may have invested a smaller 
percentage of their total AuM, e.g. 1-2%, earlier on in the current crypto 
cycle have seen that portion of their AuM grew exponentially in the past 
year.

Why invest in digital assets?
The most common primary reason given by hedge fund managers for including digital assets 
in their portfolio is ‘general diversification’ – as per 57% of the population that responded. Of 
the remainder, just under one third of respondents (29%) stated ‘exposure to a new value-
creation ecosystem’ as the primary reason to invest while 14% suggested that it made for a 
good inflation hedge.
In terms of exposure, two thirds of the hedge funds who responded have invested in digital 
assets through derivatives trading (futures/options). While respondents also confirmed that 
they invest in digital assets, using traditional value strategies – direct/spot (33%) – or passive 
funds/trusts/etps (33%).

confirmed that they are in late-stage planning to invest (9%) or looking to invest (17%), while 
just under two thirds are unlikely to invest in the next three years (57%). 17% of hedge funds

What are the main obstacles to investing
Reasons for why hedge funds are not investing in digital assets
The four main reasons cited by hedge fund managers when looking at investing in digital 
assets are: 
•
Regulatory uncertainty, 
•
Client reaction/reputational risk,
•
Lack of infrastructure/service provider availability, and
•
Outside the scope of current investment mandate. 
Around two thirds of respondents said that if the main barriers were to be removed they 
would either actively accelerate involvement/investment in digital assets (18%), or potentially 
change their approach and become more involved (46%). While 32% of respondents stated 
that the removal of barriers would still probably not impact their current approach given 
investing in digital assets remains outside their mandate.
