NOTE ON CONTENTS 

While there are many different aspects to volatility trading, not all of them are suitable for all 
investors. In order to allow easy navigation, the sections are combined into seven chapters 
that  are  likely  to  appeal  to  different  parts  of  the  equity  derivatives  client  base.  The  earlier 
chapters are most suited to equity investors, while later chapters are aimed at hedge funds 
and proprietary trading desks. The Appendix contains reference material and mathematical 
detail that has been removed from earlier chapters to enhance readability.

PREFACE 

One  of  the  main  reasons  I  decided  to  write  this  book,  was  due  to  the  lack  of  other 
publications that deal with the practical issues of using derivatives. This publication aims to 
fill  the  void  between  books  providing  an  introduction  to  derivatives,  and  advanced  books 
whose target audience are members of quantitative modelling community.  

In order to appeal to the widest audience, this publication tries to assume the least amount 
of  prior  knowledge.  The  content  quickly  moves  onto  more  advanced  subjects  in  order  to 
concentrate on more practical and advanced topics. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 1 

OPTIONS 

This chapter is focused on real life uses of options for directional investors, for example 
using  options  to  replace  a  long  position  in  the  underlying,  to  enhance  the  yield  of  a 
position through call overwriting, or to provide protection from declines. In addition to 
explaining these strategies, a methodology to choose an appropriate strike and expiry 
is shown. Answers to the most common questions are given, such as when an investor 
should  convert  an  option  before  maturity,  and  the  difference  between  delta  and  the 
probability that an option expires in the money.

CHAPTER 1: OPTIONS 

1.1: OPTION BASICS 

This section introduces options and the history of options trading. The definition of 
call and put options, and how they can be used to gain long or short equity exposure, 
is  explained.  Key  definitions  and  terminology  are  given,  including  strike,  expiry, 
intrinsic value, time value, ATM, OTM and ITM. 

HISTORY OF VOLATILITY TRADING 

While  standardised  exchange  traded  options  only  started  trading  in  1973  when  the  CBOE 
(Chicago Board Options Exchange) opened, options were first traded in London from 1690. 
Pricing was made easier by the Black-Scholes-Merton formula (usually shortened to Black-
Scholes), which was invented in 1970 by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton.  

Option trading exploded in the 1990s 

The derivatives explosion in the 1990s was partly due to the increasing popularity of hedge 
funds,  which  led  to  volatility  becoming  an  asset  class  in  its  own  right.  New  volatility 
products such as volatility swaps and variance swaps were created, and a decade later futures 
on  volatility  indices  gave  investors  listed  instruments to  trade  volatility.  In  this  chapter  we 
shall concentrate on option trading. 

CALL OPTIONS GIVE RIGHT TO BUY, PUTS RIGHT TO SELL 

A European call is a contract that gives the investor the right (but not the obligation) to buy 
a security at a certain strike price on a certain expiry date (American options can be exercised 
before expiry). A put is identical except it is the right to sell the security.  

Call option gives long exposure, put options give short exposure 

A call option profits when markets rise (as exercising the call means the investor can buy the 
underlying security cheaper than it is trading, and then sell it at a profit). A put option profits 
when markets fall (as you can buy the underlying security for less, exercise the put and sell 
the  security  for  a  profit).  Options  therefore  allow  investors  to  put  on  long  (profit  when 
prices rise) or short (profit when prices fall) strategies. 

1.1: Option Basics

SELLING OPTIONS GIVES OPPOSITE EXPOSURE 

As a call option gives long exposure to the underlying security, selling a call option results in 
short exposure to the underlying security. Similarly while a put option is a bearish (profits 
from decline in the underlying) strategy, selling a put option is a bullish strategy (profits from 
a rise in the underlying). While the direction of the underlying is the primary driver of profits 
and losses from buying or selling options, the volatility of the underlying is also a driver. 

OPTIONS TRADING GIVES VOLATILITY EXPOSURE 

If the volatility of an underlying is zero, then the price will not move and an option’s payout. 
is equal to the intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is the greater of zero and the ‘spot – strike price’ 
for a call and is the greater of zero and ‘strike price – spot’ for a put. Assuming that stock 
prices  can  move,  the  value  of  a  call  and  put  will  be  greater  than  intrinsic  due  to  the  time 
value (price of option = intrinsic value + time value). If an option strike is equal to spot (or 
is the nearest listed strike to spot) it is called at-the-money (ATM).  

As volatility increases so does the price of call and put options 

If volatility is zero, an ATM option has a price of zero (as intrinsic is zero). However, if we 
assume a stock is €50 and has a 50% chance of falling to €40 and 50% chance of rising to 
€60, it has a volatility above zero. In this example, an ATM call option with strike €50 has a 
50% chance of making €10 (if the price rises to €60 the call can be exercised to buy the stock 
at €50, which can be sold for €10 profit). The fair value of the ATM option is therefore €5 
(50% × €10); hence, as volatility rises the value of a call rises (a similar argument can be used 
for puts).  

Options have greatest time value when strike is similar to spot (i.e. ATM) 

An  ATM  option  has  the  greatest  time  value  (the  amount  the  option  price  is  above  the 
intrinsic  value).  This  can  be  seen  in  the  same  example  by  looking  at  an  out-the-money 
(OTM)  call  option  of  strike  €60  (an  OTM  option  has  strike  far  away  from  spot  and  zero 
intrinsic value). This OTM €60 call option would be worth zero, as the stock in this example 
cannot rise above €60. 

ITM options trade less than OTM options as they are more expensive 

An  in-the-money  (ITM)  option  is  one  which  has  a  strike  far  away  from  spot  and  positive 
intrinsic  value.  Due  to  the  positive  intrinsic  value  ITM  options  are  relatively  expensive, 
hence tend to trade less than their cheaper OTM counterparts.

CHAPTER 1: OPTIONS 

1.2: OPTION TRADING IN PRACTICE 

Using  options  to  invest  has  many  advantages  over  investing  in  cash  equity.  Options 
provide leverage and an ability to take a view on volatility as well as equity direction. 
However, investing in options is more complicated than investing in equity, as a strike 
and expiry need to be chosen. This section explains hidden risks, (e.g. dividends) and 
other  practical  aspects  of  option  trading  such  as  how  to  choose  the  strike,  and  the 
difference between delta and the probability an option ends up ITM. 

CHOOSING EXPIRY IS THE MOST DIFFICULT DECISION 

The biggest difference between using options and cash equities (or delta 1 products) to gain 
equity exposure is the fact a suitable expiry has to be chosen. Determining if an equity is cheap 
or  expensive  is  often  easier  than  determining  the  driver  and  timing  of  the  likely  increase  / 
decrease.  

Choosing a far dated expiry gives most opportunity for the expected correction, however far 
dated options are very expensive. Conversely if a cheaper near dated expiry is chosen, there is 
little time for the anticipated movement to occur. Usually key dates such as quarterly reporting 
or elections help determine a suitable expiry.  

Expiry choice enforces investor discipline 

Having  to  choose  an  expiry  can  be  seen  as  a  disadvantage  of  option  trading,  but  some 
investors see it as an advantage as it enforces investor discipline. The process of choosing an 
expiry focuses attention on the likely dates a stock will converge with a forecast target price.  

If the stock performs as expected the process of expiration forces the profits on the option 
position to be taken, and ensures a position is not held longer than it should be. Additionally if 
the  anticipated  return  has  not  occurred  by  the  expected  date,  the  position  expires  worthless 
and  forces  the  investor  to  make  a  decision  if  another  position  should  be  initiated.  Using 
options to gain equity exposure therefore prevents “inertia” in a portfolio.  

Both an equity and volatility view is needed to trade options 

Option trading allows a view on equity. and volatility markets to be taken. If implied volatility 
is seen to be expensive then a short volatility strategy is best (short put for a bullish strategy, 
short call for a bearish strategy). However if implied volatility is seen to be cheap then a long 
volatility strategy is best (long call for a bullish strategy, long put for a bearish strategy). The 
appropriate  strategy  for  a  one  leg  option  trade  is  shown  in  Figure  1  below.  For  multiple  leg 
strategies see the section 1.6 Option Structures Trading.

Long vol strategies should have expiry just after key date 

Typically if a key date is likely to be volatile then a long volatility strategy (long call or long 
put) should have an expiry just after this date. Conversely a short volatility strategy (short call 
or short put) should have an expiry just before the key date. For investors who wish to trade 
the implied jump of a key date, details of how to trade this implied jump is dealt with in the 
section 6.4: Trading Earnings Announcements/Jumps. 

CHOOSING STRIKE OF STRATEGY IS NOT TRIVIAL 

While  choosing  the  strike  of  a  strategy  is  not  as  difficult  as  choosing  the  expiry,  it  is  not 
trivial.  Investors  could  choose  ATM  to  benefit  from  greatest  liquidity.  Alternatively,  they 
could  look  at  the  highest  expected  return  (option  payout  less  the  premium  paid,  as  a 
percentage of the premium paid).

ITM options have highest return for “normal” market moves 

While choosing a cheap OTM option might be thought of as giving the highest return, the 
Figure below shows that, in fact, the highest returns come from in-the-money (ITM) options 
(ITM options have a strike far away from spot and have intrinsic value). This is because an 
ITM  option  has  a  high  delta  (sensitivity  to  equity  price);  hence,  if  an  investor  is  relatively 
confident of a specific return, an ITM option has the highest return for relatively “normal” 
market moves (as trading an ITM option is similar to trading a forward). 

Forwards are better than options for pure directional plays 

A forward is a contract that obliges the investor to buy a security on a certain expiry date at a 
certain strike price. A forward has a delta of 100%. An ITM call option has many similarities 
with being long a forward, as it has a relatively small time value (compared to ATM) and a 
delta  close  to  100%.  While  the  intrinsic  value  does  make  the  option  more  expensive,  this 
intrinsic value is returned at expiry. However, for an ATM option, the time value purchased 
is  deducted  from  the  returns.  For  pure  directional  plays,  forwards  (or  futures,  their  listed 
equivalent)  are  more  profitable  than  options.  The  advantage  of  options  is  in  offering 
convexity: if markets move against the investor the only loss is the premium paid, whereas a 
forward has a virtually unlimited loss. 

 
 
 
1.2: Option Trading in Practice

OTM options have highest return for “abnormal” moves 

Only if the expected return is relatively high (or abnormal) do ATM or OTM options have 
the highest return. This is because for exceptional returns their low cost and high leverage 
more than compensates for their lower delta.  

LIQUIDITY CAN BE A FACTOR IN CHOOSING STRIKE  

If an underlying is relatively illiquid, or if the size of the trade is large, an investor should take 
into account the liquidity of the maturity and strike of the option. Typically, OTM options 
are more liquid than ITM options as ITM options tie up a lot of capital. This means that for 
strikes less than spot, puts are more liquid than calls and vice versa.  

Low strike puts are usually more liquid than high strike calls 

We  note  that  as  low-strike  puts  have  a  higher  implied  than  high-strike  calls,  their  value  is 
greater and, hence, traders are more willing to use them. Low strike put options are therefore 
usually  more  liquid  than  high-strike  call  options.  In  addition,  demand  for  protection  lifts 
liquidity for low strikes compared with high strikes. 

Single stock liquidity is limited for maturities up to two years 

For single stock options, liquidity starts to fade after one year and options rarely trade over 
two years. For indices, longer maturities are liquid, partly due to the demand for long-dated 
hedges and their use in structured products. While structured products can have a maturity 
of  five  to  ten  years,  investors  typically  lose  interest  after  a  few  years  and  sell  the  product 
back.  The  hedging  of  a  structured  product,  therefore,  tends  to  be  focused  on  more  liquid 
maturities of around three years.  

Hedge funds and structured product flow can overlap 

Hedge funds tend to focus around the one-year maturity, with two to three years being the 
longest maturity they will consider. The two-to-three year maturity is where there is greatest 
overlap between hedge funds and structured desks. 

DELTA MEASURES DIVIDEND RISK AND EQUITY RISK 

The delta of the option is the amount of equity market exposure an option has. As a stock 
price falls by the dividend amount on its ex-date, delta is equal to the exposure to dividends 
that go ex before expiry. The dividend risk is equal to the negative of the delta. For example, 
if you have a call of positive delta, if (expected or actual) dividends rise, the call is worth less 
(as the stock falls by the dividend amount). 

If a  dividend is substantial, it could be in an investor’s interest to exercise early. For more 
details, see the section 1.3 Maintenance of Option Positions.

CHAPTER 1: OPTIONS 

DELTA IS NOT THE  PROBABILITY OPTION EXPIRES ITM 

A  digital  call  option  is  an  option  that  pays  100%  if  spot  expires  above  the  strike  price  (a 
digital  put  pays  100%  if  spot  is  below the  strike  price).  The  probability  of  such  an  option 
expiring ITM is equal to its delta, as the payoff only depends on it being ITM or not (the size 
of the payment does not change with how much ITM spot is). For a vanilla option this is not 
the  case;  hence,  there  is  a  difference  between  the  delta  and  the  probability  of  being  ITM. 
This difference is typically small unless the maturity of the option is very long. 

Delta takes into account the amount an option can be ITM 

While a call can have an infinite payoff, a put’s maximum value is the strike (as spot cannot 
go below zero). The delta hedge for the option has to take this into account, so a call delta 
must be greater than the probability of being ITM. Similarly, the absolute value (as put deltas 
are  negative)  of  the  put  delta  must  be  less  than  the  probability  of  expiring  ITM.  A  more 
mathematical explanation (for European options) is given below: 

Call delta    

>   Probability call ends up ITM 

Abs (Put delta  <   Probability put ends up ITM 

Mathematical proof option delta is different from probability of being ITM at 
expiry 

Call delta   

= N(d1) 

Put delta   

= N(d1) - 1 

Call probability ITM  

= N(d2) 

Put probability ITM  

= 1 - N(d2) 

where: 

Definition  of  d1  is  the  standard  Black-Scholes  formula  for  d1.  For  more  details,  see  the 
section A.7 Black-Scholes Formula.

= implied volatility 

= time to expiry 

N(z) = cumulative normal distribution 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.2: Option Trading in Practice  

9 

As d2 is less than d1 (see above) and N(z) is a monotonically increasing function, this means 
that N(d2) is less than N(d1). Hence, the probability of a call being in the money = N(d2) is 
less than the delta = N(d1). As the delta of a put = delta of call – 1, and the sum of call and 
put being ITM = 1, the above results for a put must be true as well. 

The difference between delta and probability being ITM at expiry is greatest for long-dated 
options with high volatility (as the difference between d1 and d2 is greatest for them). 

STOCK REPLACING WITH LONG CALL OR SHORT PUT 

As a stock has a delta of 100%, the identical exposure to the equity market can be obtained 
by purchasing calls (or selling puts) whose total delta is 100%. For example, one stock could 
be replaced by two 50% delta calls, or by going short two -50% delta puts. Such a strategy 
can benefit from buying (or selling) expensive implied volatility. There can also be benefits 
from  a  tax  perspective  and,  potentially,  from  any  embedded  borrow  cost  in  the  price  of 
options  (price  of  positive  delta  option  strategies  is  improved  by  borrow  cost).  As  the 
proceeds  from  selling  the  stock  are  typically  greater  than  the  cost  of  the  calls  (or  margin 
requirement of the short put), the difference can be invested to earn interest.

Stock replacing via calls benefits from convexity 

As  a  call  option  is  convex,  this  means  that  the  delta  increases  as  spot  increases  and  vice 
versa. If a long position in the underlying is sold and replaced with calls of equal delta, then 
if  markets  rise  the  delta  increases  and  the  calls  make  more  money  than  the  long  position 
would have. Similarly, if markets fall the delta decreases and the losses are reduced. This can 
be seen in Figure 3 above as the portfolio of cash (proceeds from sale of the underlying) and 
call options is always above the long underlying profile. The downside of using calls is that 
the position will give a worse profile than the original long position if the underlying does 
not move much (as call options will fall each day by the theta if spot remains unchanged). 
Using call options is best when implied volatility is cheap and the investor expects the stock 
to move by more than currently implied.

CHAPTER 1: OPTIONS 

Put underwriting benefits from selling expensive implied  

Typically the implied volatility of options trades slightly above the expected realised volatility 
of  the  underlying  over  the  life  of  the  option  (due  to  a  mismatch  between  supply  and 
demand).  Stock  replacement  via  put  selling  therefore  benefits  from  selling  (on  average) 
expensive  volatility.  Selling  a  naked  put  is  known  as  put  underwriting,  as  the  investor  has 
effectively  underwritten  the  stock  (in  the  same  way  investment  banks  underwrite  a  rights 
issue).  

Put underwriting pays investors for work that otherwise might be wasted 

The strike of put underwriting should be chosen at the highest level at which the investor 
would wish to purchase the stock, which allows an investor to earn a premium from taking 
this view (whereas normally the work done to establish an attractive entry point would be 
wasted if the stock did not fall to that level).  

Asset allocators use put underwriting to rebalance portfolios 

This  strategy  has  been  used  significantly  recently  by  asset  allocators  who  are  underweight 
equities  and  are  waiting  for  a  better  entry  point  to  re-enter  the  equity  market  (earning  the 
premium  provides  a  buffer should  equities rally).  If  an investor  does not  wish  to  own  the 
stock  and  only  wants  to  earn  the  premium,  then  an  OTM  strike  should  be  chosen  at  a 
support level that is likely to remain firm. 

Put underwriting benefits from selling skew 

Put underwriting gives a similar profile to a long stock, short call profile, otherwise known as 
call  overwriting.  One  difference  between  call  overwriting  and  put  underwriting  is  that  if 
OTM options are used, then put underwriting benefits from selling skew (which is normally 
overpriced).  For  more  details  on  the  benefits  of  selling  volatility,  see  the  section  1.4  Call 
Overwriting. 

STOCK REPLACEMENT ALTERS DIVIDEND EXPOSURE 

It is important to note that the dividend exposure is not the same, as only the owner of a 
stock  receives  dividends.  While  the  option  owner  does  not  benefit  directly,  the  expected 
dividend  will  be  used  to  price  the  option  fairly  (hence  investors  only  suffer/benefit  if 
dividends are different from expectations).

1.3: MAINTENANCE OF OPTION POSITIONS 

During the life of an American option many events can occur in which it might be 
preferable to own the underlying shares (rather than the option) and exercise early. 
In  addition  to  dividends,  an  investor  might  want  the  voting  rights,  or  alternatively 
might  want  to  sell  the  option  to  purchase  another  option  (rolling  the  option).  We 
investigate these life cycle events and explain when it is in an investor’s interest to 
exercise, or roll, an option before expiry. 

CONVERTING OPTIONS EARLY IS RARE 

Options  on  indices  are  usually  European,  which  means  they  can  only  be  exercised  at 
maturity. The inclusion of automatic exercise, and the fact it is impossible to exercise before 
maturity, means European options require only minimal maintenance. Single stock options, 
however, are typically American (apart from emerging market underlyings). While American 
options are rarely exercised early, there are circumstances when it is in an investor’s interest 
to  exercise  an  ITM  option  early.  For  both  calls  and  puts  the  correct  decision  for  early 
exercise  depends  on  the  net  benefit  of  doing  so  (ie,  the  difference  between  earning  the 
interest on the strike and net present value of dividends) versus the time value of the option. 

  Calls should be exercised just before the ex-date of a large unadjusted dividend. 
In order to exercise a call, the strike price needs to be paid. The interest on this strike 
price  normally  makes  it  unattractive  to  exercise  early.  However,  if  there  is  a  large 
unadjusted dividend that goes ex before expiry, it might be in an investor’s interest to 
exercise an ITM option early (see Figure 4 above). In this case, the time value should be 
less than the dividend NPV (net present value) less total interest r (=erfr×T-1) earned on 
the strike price K. In order to maximise ‘dividend NPV– Kr’, it is best to exercise just 
before an ex-date (as this maximises ‘dividend NPV’ and minimises the total interest r). 

  Puts should be exercised early (preferably just after ex-date) if interest rates are 
high. If interest rates are high, then the interest r from putting the stock back at a high 
strike price K (less dividend NPV) might be greater than the time value. In this case, a 
put should be exercised early. In order to maximise ‘Kr – dividend NPV’, a put should 
preferably be exercised just after an ex-date.

Calls should be exercised early if there is a large dividend 

The payout profile of a long call is similar to the payout of a long stock + long put of the same strike . 
As only ITM options should be exercised and as the strike of an ITM call means the put of the same 
strike is OTM, we shall use this relationship to calculate when an option should be exercised early. 

An  American  call  should  only  be  exercised  if  it  is  in  an  investor’s  interest  to  exercise  the 
option and buy a European put of the same strike (a European put of same strike will have 
the same time value as a European call if intrinsic value is assumed to be the forward). 

  Choice A: Do not exercise. In this case there is no benefit or cost. 
  Choice  B:  Borrow  strike  K  at  interest  r  (=erfr×T-1)  in  order  to  exercise  the  American 
call. The called stock will earn the dividend NPV and the position has to be hedged with 
the purchase of a European put (of cost equal to the time value of a European call). 

An investor will only exercise early if choice B > choice A.

Puts should only be exercised if interest earned (less dividends) exceeds time 
value 

For puts, it is simplest to assume an investor is long stock and long an American put. This 
payout is similar to a long call of the same strike. An American put should only be exercised 
against  the  long stock  in  the  same  portfolio  if  it  is  in  an  investor’s  interest  to  exercise  the 
option and buy a European call of the same strike. 

  Choice A: Do not exercise. In this case the portfolio of long stock and long put benefits 

from the dividend NPV. 

  Choice B: Exercise put against long stock, receiving strike K, which can earn interest r 
(=erfr×T-1). The position has to be hedged with the purchase of a European call (of cost 
equal to the time value of a European put). 

An investor will only exercise early if choice B > choice A 

  Kr – time value > dividend NPV 

  Kr – dividend NPV > time value for American put to be exercised 

Selling ITM options that should be exercised early can be profitable 

There  have  been  occasions  when  traders  deliberately  sell  ITM  options  that  should  be 
exercised early, hoping that some investors will forget. Even if the original counterparty is 
aware of this fact, exchanges randomly assign the counterparty to exercised options. As it is 
unlikely that 100% of investors will realise in time, such a strategy can be profitable. 

ITM OPTIONS USUALLY EXERCISED AUTOMATICALLY 

In order to prevent situations where an investor might suffer a loss if they do not give notice 
to exercise an ITM option in time, most exchanges have some form of automatic exercise. If 
an investor (for whatever reason) does not want the option to be automatically exercised, he 
must give instructions to that effect. The hurdle for automatic exercise is usually above ATM 
in order to account for any trading fees that might be incurred in selling the underlying post 
exercise. 

Eurex automatic exercise has a higher hurdle than CBOE 

For  the  CBOE,  options  are  automatically  exercised  if  they  are  US$0.01  or  more  ITM 
(reduced in June 2008 from US$0.05 or more), which is in line with Euronext-Liffe rules of a 
€0.01 or GBP0.01 minimum ITM hurdle. Eurex has a higher automatic hurdle, as a contract 
price has to be ITM by 99.99 or more (eg, for a euro-denominated stock with a contract size 
of 100 shares this means it needs to be at €0.9999 or more). Eurex does allow an investor to 
specify  an  automatic  exercise  level  lower  than  the  automatic  hurdle,  or  a  percentage  of 
exercise price up to 9.99%. 

 
14 

CHAPTER 1: OPTIONS 

CORPORATE ACTIONS CAN ADJUST STRIKE 

While  options  do  not  adjust  for  ordinary  dividends1,  they  do  adjust  for  special  dividends. 
Different exchanges have different definitions of what is a special dividend, but typically it is 
considered special if it is declared as a special dividend, or is larger than a certain threshold 
(eg,  10%  of  the stock  price).  In  addition,  options  are  adjusted  in  the  event  of  a  corporate 
action, for example, a stock split or rights issue.  

Equities and indices can treat bonus share issues differently 

Options on equities and indices can treat bonus share issues differently. A stock dividend in 
lieu  of  an  ordinary  dividend  is  considered  an  ordinary  dividend  for  options  on  an  equity 
(hence is not adjusted) but is normally adjusted by the index provider.  

Adjustment negates impact of dividend or corporate action 

For both special dividends and corporate actions, the adjustment negates the impact of the 
event (principal of unchanged contract values), so the theoretical price of the options should 
be  able  to  ignore  the  event.  As  the  strike  post  adjustment  will  be  non-standard,  typically 
exchanges create a new set of options with the normal strikes. While older options can still 
trade,  liquidity  generally  passes  to  the  new  standard  strike  options  (particularly  for  longer 
maturities which do not have much open interest). 

M&A AND SPINOFFS CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS 

If a company spins off a subsidiary and gives shareholders shares in the new company, the 
underlying  for  the  option  turns  into  a  basket  of  the  original  equity  and  the  spun-off 
company. New options going into the original company are usually created, and the liquidity 
of the options into the basket is likely to fade. For a company that is taken over, the existing 
options  in  that  company  will  convert  into  whatever  shareholders  were  offered.  If  the 
acquisition was for stock, then the options convert into shares, but if the offer is partly in 
cash, then options can lose a lot of value as the volatility of cash is zero. 

OPTIONS OFTEN ROLLED BEFORE EXPIRY 

The  time  value  of  an  option  decays  quicker  for  short-dated  options  than  for  far-dated 
options. To reduce the effect of time decay, investors often roll before expiry. For example, 
an  investor  could  buy  a  one-year  option  and  roll  it  after  six  months  to  a  new  one-year 
option. 

1 Some option markets adjust for all dividends. 

 
                                                      
1.4: Call Overwriting

1.4: CALL OVERWRITING 

For a directional investor who owns a stock (or index), call overwriting by selling an 
OTM  call  is  one  of  the  most  popular  methods  of  yield  enhancement.  Historically, 
call  overwriting (otherwise  known  as buy-write,  as  the  stock  is  bought  but a  call is 
written  against  it)  has  been  a  profitable  strategy  due  to  implied  volatility  usually 
being overpriced. However, call overwriting does underperform in volatile, strongly 
rising equity markets. Overwriting with the shortest maturity is best, and the strike 
should be slightly OTM for optimum returns. 

IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS USUALLY OVERPRICED 

The implied volatility of options is on average 1-2pts above the volatility realised over the 
life  of  the  option.  This  ‘implied  volatility  premium’  is  usually  greater  for  indices  than  for 
single  stocks.  As  we  can  see  no  reason  why  these  imbalances  will  fade,  we  expect  call 
overwriting to continue to outperform on average. The key imbalances are:  

  Option buying for protection. In the same way that no one buys car insurance because 
they think it is a good investment, investors are happy buying expensive protection to 
protect against downside risks. 

  Unwillingness to sell low premium options causes market makers to raise their 
prices (selling low premium options, like selling lottery tickets, has to be done on a large 
scale to be attractive). 

  High gamma of near-dated options has a gap risk premium (risk of stock jumping, 

either intraday or between closing and opening prices). 

  Index implieds lifted by structured products. Structured products are often based on 
an index, and can offer downside protection. This lifts index implied relative to single 
stock implied. Also protection is usually bought on an index to protect against macros 
risks.  It  is  rare  to  protect  a  single  stock  position  (if  an  investor  is  worried  about 
downside in a stock they usually do not buy it to begin with). 

BUY-WRITE BENEFITS FROM SELLING EXPENSIVE VOL 

Short-dated implied volatility has historically been overpriced2 due to the above supply and 
demand imbalances. In order to profit from this characteristic, a long investor can sell a call 
against a long position in the underlying of the option. Should the underlying perform well 
and the call be exercised, the underlying can be used to satisfy the exercise  of the call. As 
equities should be assumed to have, on average, a positive return, it is best to overwrite with 
a slightly OTM option to reduce the probability of the option sold expiring ITM. 

2 We note that implied volatility is not necessarily as overpriced as would first appear. For more detail, 
see the section 3.1 Implied Volatility Should Be Above Realized Volatility.

Call overwriting is a useful way to gain yield in flat markets 

If markets are range trading, or are approaching a technical resistance level, then selling a call 
at the top of the range (or resistance level) is a useful way of gaining yield. Such a strategy 
can  be  a  useful  tactical  way  of  earning  income  on  a  core  strategic  portfolio,  or  potentially 
could be used as part of an exit strategy for a given target price. 

Selling at target price enforces disciplined investing 

If  a  stock  reaches  the  desired  target  price,  there  is  the  temptation  to  continue  to  own  the 
strong performer. Over time a portfolio can run the risk of being a collection of stocks that 
had previously been undervalued, but are now at fair value. To prevent this inertia diluting 
the performance of a fund, some fund managers prefer to call overwrite at their target price 
to enforce disciplined investing, (as the stock will be called away when it reaches the target). 
As  there  are  typically  more  Buy  recommendations  than  Sell  recommendations,  call 
overwriting  can  ensure  a  better  balance  between  the  purchase  and  (called  away)  sale  of 
stocks.

PUT UNDERWRITING HAS SIMILAR PROFILE 

Figure 5 above shows the profiles of a short call and of a long equity with an overwritten 
call. The resulting profile of call overwriting is similar to that of a short put (Figure 6 below); 
hence, call overwriting could be considered similar to stock replacement with a short put (or 
put underwriting). Both call overwriting and put underwriting attempt to profit from the fact 
that implied volatility, on average, tends to be overpriced. While selling a naked put is seen as 
risky, due to the near infinite losses should stock prices fall, selling a call against a long equity 
position is seen as less risky (as the equity can be delivered against the exercise of the call).

1×2 call spreads are useful when a bounce-back is expected 

If a near zero cost 1×2 call spread (long 1×ATM call, short 2×OTM calls) is overlaid on a 
long  stock  position,  the  resulting  position  offers  the  investor  twice  the  return  for  equity 
increases up to the short upper strike. For very high returns the payout is capped, in a similar 
way as for call overwriting. Such positioning is useful when there has been a sharp drop in 
the markets and a limited bounce back to earlier levels is anticipated. The level of the bounce 
back should be in line with or below the short upper strike. Typically, short maturities are 
best (less than three months) as the profile of a 1×2 call spread is similar to a short call for 
longer maturities.

CALL OVERWRITING IS BEST DONE ON AN INDEX 

Many  investors  call  overwrite  on  single  stocks.  However,  single-stock  implied  volatility 
trades  more  in  line  with  realised  volatility  than  index  implieds.  The  reason  why  index 
implieds are more overpriced than single-stock implieds is due to the demand from hedgers 
and structured product sellers. Call overwriting at the index level also reduces trading costs 
(due to the narrower bid-offer spread). 

The  CBOE  has  created  a  one-month  call  overwriting  index  on  the  S&P500  (BXM  index), 
which  is  the  longest  call  overwriting  time  series  available.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the 
BXM  is  a  total  return  index;  hence,  it  needs  to  be  compared  to  the  S&P500  total  return 
index (SPXT Bloomberg code) not the S&P500 price return (SPX Bloomberg code). As can 
be  seen  in  Figure  8  below,  comparing  the  BXM  index  to  the  S&P500  price  return  index 
artificially flatters the performance of call overwriting. 

Figure 8. S&P500 and S&P500 1M ATM Call Overwriting Index (BXM)

Call overwriting performance varies according to conditions 

On average, ATM index call overwriting has been a profitable strategy. However, there have 
been periods of time when it is has been unprofitable. The best way to examine the returns 
under  different  market  conditions  is to  divide  the BXM  index  by the  total  return  S&P500 
index (as the BXM is a total return index).

BXM (1m 100%) / S&P500 total return

Overwriting underperforms in bull markets with low volatility 

Since  the  BXM  index  was  created,  there  have  been  seven  distinct  periods  (see  Figure  9 
above), each with different equity and volatility market conditions. Of the seven periods, the 
two in which returns for call overwriting are negative are the bull markets of the mid-1990s 
and middle of the last decade. These were markets with very low volatility, causing the short 
call option sold to earn insufficient premium to compensate for the option being ITM.  

It is important to note that call overwriting can outperform in slowly rising markets, as the 
premium earned is in excess of the amount the option ends up ITM. This was the case for 
the BXM between 1986 and the mid-1990s. It is difficult to identify these periods in advance 
as  there  is  a  very  low  correlation  between  BXM  outperformance  and  the  earlier  historical 
volatility. 

LOWER EXPOSURE TO EQUITY RISK PREMIUM 

We  note  that  while  profits  should  be  earned  from  selling  an  expensive  call,  the  delta  (or 
equity sensitivity) of the long underlying short call portfolio is significantly less than 100% 
(even  if  the  premium  from  the  short  call  is  reinvested  into  the  strategy).  Assuming  that 
equities  are  expected  to  earn  more  than  the  risk  free  rate  (ie,  have  a  positive  equity  risk 
premium),  this  lower  delta  can  mean  more  money  is  lost  by  having  a  less  equity-sensitive 
portfolio than is gained by selling expensive volatility. On average, call overwriting appears 

 
 
 
20 

CHAPTER 1: OPTIONS 

to be a successful strategy, and its success has meant that it is one of the most popular uses 
of trading options. 

OVERWRITING WITH NEAR-DATED OPTIONS IS BEST  

Near-dated options have the highest theta, so an investor earns the greatest carry from call 
overwriting with short-dated options. It is possible to overwrite with 12 one-month options 
in  a  year,  as  opposed  to  four  three-month  options  or  one  12-month  option.  While 
overwriting  with  the  shortest  maturity  possible  has  the  highest  returns  on  average,  the 
strategy does have potentially higher risk. If a market rises one month, then retreats back to 
its original value by the end of the quarter, a one-month call overwriting strategy will have 
suffered a loss on the first call sold but a three-month overwriting strategy will not have had 
a  call  expire  ITM. However,  overwriting  with far-dated  expiries  is more  likely to  eliminate 
the equity risk premium the investor is trying to earn (as any outperformance above a certain 
level will be called away).

BEST RETURNS WITH SLIGHTLY OTM OPTIONS 

While overwriting with near-dated expiries is clearly superior to overwriting with far-dated 
expiries, the optimal choice of strike to overwrite with depends on the market environment. 
As equities are expected, on average, to post a positive return, overwriting should be done 
with slightly OTM options. However, if a period of time where equities had a negative return 
is chosen for a back-test, then a strike below 100% could show the highest return. Looking 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.4: Call Overwriting 

21 

at a period of time where the SX5E had a positive return shows that for one-month options 
a strike between 103%-104% is best (see Figure 10 above).  

Typically call overwriting with c25% delta call options is best  

For three-month options, the optimal strike is a higher 107%-108%, but the outperformance 
is  approximately  half  as  good  as  for  one-month  options.  These  optimal  strikes  for 
overwriting  could  be  seen  to  be  arguably  high,  as  recently  there  have  been  instances  of 
severe  declines  (TMT  bubble  bursting,  Lehman  bankruptcy),  which  were  followed  by 
significant price rises afterwards. For single-stock call overwriting, these strikes could seem 
to be low, as single stocks are more volatile. For this reason, many investors use the current 
level of volatility to determine the strike or choose a fixed delta option (eg, 25%). 

OVERWRITING REDUCES VOLATILITY  

While selling an option could be considered risky, the volatility of returns from overwriting a 
long equity position is reduced by overwriting. This is because the payout profile is capped 
for equity prices above the strike. An alternative way of looking at this is that the delta of the 
portfolio is reduced from 100% (solely invested in equity) to 100% less the delta of the call 
(c50% depending on strike). The reduced delta suppresses the volatility of the portfolio.  

Risk reduction less impressive if Sortino ratios are used  

We note that the low call overwriting volatility is due to the lack of volatility to the upside, as 
call  overwriting  has  the  same  downside  risk  as  a  long  position.  For  this  reason,  using  the 
Sortino ratio (for more details, see the section A11 Sortino Ratio in the Appendix) is likely to be 
a fairer measure of call overwriting risk than standard deviation, as standard deviation is not 
a good measure of risk for skewed distributions. Sortino ratios show that the call overwriting 
downside risk is identical to a long position; hence, call overwriting should primarily be done 
to enhance returns and is not a viable strategy for risk reduction. 

Optimal strike is similar for single stocks and indices 

While this analysis is focused on the SX5E, the analysis can be used to guide single-stock call 
overwriting (although the strike could be adjusted higher by the single-stock implied divided 
by SX5E implied).

CHAPTER 1: OPTIONS 

ENHANCED CALL OVERWRITING IS DIFFICULT 

Enhanced  call  overwriting  is  the  term  given  when  call  overwriting  is  only  done 
opportunistically  or  the  parameters  (strike  or  expiry)  are  varied  according  to  market 
conditions. On the index level, the returns from call overwriting are so high that enhanced 
call overwriting is difficult, as the opportunity cost from not always overwriting is too high. 
For  single  stocks,  the returns for  call  overwriting  are  less  impressive;  hence,  enhanced  call 
overwriting could be more successful. An example of single-stock enhanced call overwriting 
is to only overwrite when an implied is high compared to peers in the same sector. We note 
that even with enhanced single-stock call overwriting, the wider bid-offer cost and smaller 
implied volatility premium to realised means returns can be lower than call overwriting at the 
index level. 

Enhanced call overwriting returns likely to be arbitraged away 

Should a systematic way to enhance call overwriting be viable, this method could be applied 
to volatility trading without needing an existing long position in the underlying. Given the 
presence of statistical arbitrage funds and high frequency traders, we believe it is unlikely that 
a simple automated enhanced call overwriting strategy on equity or volatility markets is likely 
to outperform vanilla call overwriting on an ongoing basis. 

 
 
1.5: Protection Strategies Using Options 

23  

1.5: PROTECTION STRATEGIES USING OPTIONS 

For both economic and regulatory reasons, one of the most popular uses of options is 
to provide protection against a long position in the underlying. The cost of buying 
protection  through  a  put  is  lowest  in  calm,  low-volatility  markets,  but  in  more 
turbulent  markets  the  cost  can  be  too  high.  In  order  to  reduce  the  cost  of  buying 
protection  in  volatile markets  (which  is  often  when  protection  is  in  most  demand), 
many investors sell an OTM put and/or an OTM call to lower the cost of the long 
put protection bought. 

CHEAPEN PROTECTION BY SELLING OTM PUT & CALL 

Buying  a  put  against  a  long  position  gives  complete  and  total  protection  for  underlying 
moves below the strike (as the investor can simply put the long position back for the strike 
price following severe declines). The disadvantage of a put is the relatively high cost, as an 
investor  is  typically  unwilling  to  pay  more  than  1%-2%  for  protection  (as  the  cost  of 
protection usually has to be made up through alpha to avoid underperforming if markets do 
not decline). The cost of the long put protection can be cheapened by selling an OTM put 
(turning the long put into a long put spread), by selling an OTM call (turning put protection 
into a collar), or both (resulting in a put spread vs call, or put spread collar). The strikes of 
the OTM puts and calls sold can be chosen to be in line with technical supports or resistance 
levels.

CHAPTER 1: OPTIONS 

  Puts  give  complete  protection  without  capping  performance.  As  puts  give  such 
good protection, their cost is usually prohibitive unless the strike is low. For this reason, 
put protection is normally bought for strikes around 90%. Given that this protection will 
not  kick  in  until  there  is  a decline  of  10%  or  more,  puts  offer  the most  cost-effective 
protection only during a severe crash (or if very short-term protection is required). 

  Put  spreads  only  give  partial  protection  but  are  cost  effective.  While  puts  give 
complete protection, often only partial protection is necessary, in which case selling an 
OTM  put  against  the  long  put  (a  put  spread)  can  be  an  attractive  protection  strategy. 
The value of the put sold can be used to either cheapen the protection or lift the strike 
of the long put.  

  Collars can be zero cost as they give up some upside. While investors appreciate the 
need for protection, the cost needs to be funded through reduced performance (or less 
alpha) or by giving up some upside. Selling an OTM call to fund a put (a collar) results 
in a cap on performance. However, if the strike of the call is set at a reasonable level, the 
capped return could still be attractive. The strike of the OTM call is often chosen to give 
the collar a zero cost. Collars can be a visually attractive low (or zero) cost method of 
protection as returns can be floored at the largest tolerable loss and capped at the target 
return. A collar is unique among protection strategies in not having significant volatility 
exposure,  as  its  profile  is  similar  to  a  short  position  in  the  underlying.  Collars  are, 
however, exposed to skew. 

  Put  spread  collars  best  when  volatility  is  high,  as  two  OTM  options  are 
sold. Selling both an OTM put and OTM call against a long put (a put spread collar) is 
typically attractive when volatility is high, as this lifts the value of the two OTM options 
sold  more  than  the  long  put  bought.  If  equity  markets  are  range  bound,  a  put  spread 
collar  can  also  be  an  attractive  form  of  protection.  Put  spread  collars  are  normally 
structured to be near zero cost (just like a collar).

Portfolio protection is usually done via indices to lower cost 

While an equity investor will typically purchase individual stocks, if protection is bought then 
this is usually done at the index level. This is because the risk the investor wishes to hedge 
against  is  the  general  equity  or  macroeconomic  risk.  If a  stock  is  seen  as  having  excessive 
downside risk, it is usually sold rather than a put bought against it. An additional reason why 
index  protection  is  more  common  than  single  stock  protection  is  the  fact  that  bid-offer 
spreads for single stocks are wider than for an index.

Partial protection can give attractive risk reward profile  

For six-month maturity options, the cost of a 90% put is typically in line with a 95%-85% 
put spread (except during periods of high volatility, when the cost of a put is usually more 
expensive).  Put  spreads  often  have  an  attractive  risk-reward  profile  for  protection  of  the 
same  cost,  as  the  strike  of  the  long  put  can  be  higher  than  the  long  put  of  a  put  spread. 
Additionally,  if  an  investor  is  concerned  with  outperforming  peers,  then  a  c10% 
outperformance  given  by  a  95%-85%  put  spread  should  be  sufficient  to  attract  investors 
(there is little incremental competitive advantage in a greater outperformance). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
26 

CHAPTER 1: OPTIONS 

Implied volatility is far more important than skew for put-spread pricing 

A rule of thumb is that the value of the OTM put sold should be approximately one-third 
the value of the long put (if it were significantly less, the cost saving in moving from a put to 
a  put  spread  would  not  compensate  for  giving  up  complete  protection).  While  selling  an 
OTM put against a near-ATM put does benefit from selling skew (as the implied volatility of 
the OTM put sold is higher than the volatility of the near ATM long put bought), the effect 
of skew on put spread pricing is not normally that significant (far more significant is the level 
of implied volatility). 

Collars are more sensitive to skew than implied volatility 

Selling a call against a long put suffers from buying skew. The effect of skew is greater for a 
collar than for a put spread, as skew affects both legs of the structure the same way (whereas 
the effect of skew on the long and short put of a put spread partly cancels). If skew was flat, 
the cost of a collar typically reduces by 1% of spot. The level of volatility for near-zero cost 
collars is not normally significant, as the long volatility of the put cancels the short volatility 
of the call.  

Capping performance should only be used when a long rally is unlikely 

A collar or put spread collar caps the performance of the portfolio at the strike of the OTM 
call sold. They should only therefore be used when the likelihood of a strong, long-lasting 
rally (or significant bounce) is perceived to be relatively small. 

Bullish investors could sell two puts against long put 

If  an  investor  is  bullish  on  the  equity  market,  then  a  protection  strategy  that  caps 
performance is unsuitable. Additionally, as the likelihood of substantial declines is seen to be 
small, the cost of protection via a put or put spread is too high. In this scenario, a zero cost 
1×2  put  spread  could  be  used  as  a  pseudo-protection  strategy.  The  long  put  is  normally 
ATM, which means the portfolio is 100% protected against falls up to the lower strike, and 
gives partial protection below that until the breakeven. A loss is only suffered if the equity 
market falls below the breakeven. 

1×2 put spreads only give pseudo-protection 

We do not consider 1x2 put spreads to offer true protection, as during severe declines it will 
suffer a loss when the underlying portfolio is also heavily loss making. The payout of 1×2 
put spreads for maturities of around three months or more is initially similar to a short put, 
so we consider it to be a bullish strategy. However, for the SX5E a roughly six-month zero-
cost 1×2 put spread, whose upper strike is 95%, has historically had a breakeven below 80% 
and  declines  of  more  than  20%  in  six  months  are  very  rare.  As  1×2  put  spreads  do  not 
provide  protection  when  you  need  it  most,  they  could be  seen  as  a separate  long position 
rather than a protection strategy.

PROTECTION MUST BE PAID FOR: QUESTION IS HOW? 

If an investor seeks protection, the most important decision that has to be made is how to 
pay for it. The cost of protection can be paid for in one of three ways. Figure 15 below shows 
when  this  cost  is  suffered  by  the  investor,  and  when  the  structure  starts  to  provide 
protection against declines. 

Premium. The simplest method of paying for protection is through premium. In this case, a 
put or put spread should be bought. 

Loss of upside. If the likelihood of extremely high returns is small, or if a premium cannot 
be  paid,  then  giving  up  upside  via  collars  or  put  spread  collars  is  the  best  way  to  pay  for 
protection. 

Potential losses on extreme downside. If an investor is willing to tolerate additional losses 
during  extreme  declines,  then  a  1×2  put  spread  can  offer  a  zero  cost  way  of  buying 
protection against limited declines in the market.

CHAPTER 1: OPTIONS 

BEST STRATEGY DETERMINED BY VOLATILITY LEVEL 

The level of volatility can determine the most suitable protection strategy an investor needs 
to decide how bullish and bearish they are on the equity and volatility markets. If volatility is 
low, then puts should be affordable enough to buy without offsetting the cost by selling an 
OTM option. For low to moderate levels of volatility, a put spread is likely to give the best 
protection that can be easily afforded. As a collar is similar to a short position with limited 
volatility  exposure,  it  is  most  appropriate  for  a  bearish  investor  during  average  periods  of 
volatility (or if an investor does not have a strong view on volatility). Put spreads collars (or 
1×2  put  spreads)  are  most  appropriate  during  high  levels  of  volatility  (as  two  options  are 
sold for every option bought). 

MATURITY DRIVEN BY DURATION OF LIKELY DECLINE 

The  choice  of  protection  strategy  is  typically  driven  by  an  investor’s  view  on  equity  and 
volatility  markets.  Similarly  the  choice  of  strikes  is  usually  restricted  by  the  premium  an 
investor can afford. Maturity is potentially the area where there is most choice, and the final 
decision will be driven by an investor’s belief in the severity and duration of any decline. If 
he  wants  protection  against  a  sudden  crash,  a  short-dated  put  is  the  most  appropriate 
strategy. However, for a long drawn out bear market, a longer maturity is most appropriate.

Median maturity of protection bought is c4 months 

The  average  choice  of  protection  is  c6  months,  but  this  is  skewed  by  a  few  long-dated 
hedges. The median maturity is c4 months. Protection can be bought for maturities of one 
week to over a year. Even if an investor has decided how long he needs protection, he can 
implement it via one far-dated option or multiple near-dated options. For example, one-year 
protection could be via a one-year put or via the purchase of a three-month put every three 
months  (four  puts  over  the  course  of  a  year).  The  typical  cost  of  ATM  puts  for  different 
maturities is given below.

Short-dated puts offer greatest protection but highest cost 

If  equity  markets  fall  20%  in  the  first  three  months  of  the  year  and  recover  to  the  earlier 
level  by  the  end  of  the  year,  then  a  rolling  three-month  put  strategy  will  have  a  positive 
payout in the first quarter but a one-year put will be worth nothing at expiry. While rolling 
near-dated  puts  will  give  greater  protection  than  a  long-dated  put,  the  cost  is  higher 
(see Figure 17 above). 

SHORT VOL AGAINST LONG PUT PERFORMS WELL 

All protection strategies that combine a long and a short aim to offset the overpriced cost of 
protection  by  selling  the  same  overpriced  implied  volatility  for  a  different  maturity  and 
strike.  Hence  such  strategies  tend  to  back-test  well  as  the  overall  exposure  to  expensive 
implied  volatility  is  near  zero.  As  the  net  cost  of  such  strategies  is  near  zero,  while  at  the 
same time (usually) decreasing the volatility of the portfolio, their risk adjusted performance 
can be impressive. Their performance can often be further improved by selling near dated 
volatility against the long far dated protection. 

MULTIPLE EXPIRY PROTECTION STRATEGIES 

Typically,  a  protection strategy  involving  multiple  options  has  the same  maturity for  all  of 
the  options.  However,  some  investors  choose  a  nearer  maturity  for  the  options  they  are 
short, as more premium can be earned selling a near-dated option multiple times (as near-
dated options have higher theta). These strategies are most successful when term structure is 
inverted, as the volatility for the near-dated option sold is higher. Having a nearer maturity 
for the long put option and longer maturity for the short options makes less sense, as this 
increases the cost (assuming the nearer-dated put is rolled at expiry). 

Calendar collar effectively overlays call overwriting on a long put position 

If the maturity of the short call of a collar is closer than the maturity of the long put, then 
this is effectively the combination of a long put and call overwriting. For example, the cost 
of a three-month put can be recovered by selling one-month calls. This strategy outperforms 
in a downturn and also has a lower volatility (see Figure 18 below).

Selling a put against calendar collar creates either a calendar put spread 
collar, or a put vs strangle/straddle 

If a put is sold against the position of a calendar collar, then the final position depends on 
the  maturity  of  the  short  put.  The  short  put  can  either  have  the  maturity  of  the  long  put 
(creating  a  calendar  put  spread  collar),  or  the  maturity  of  the  short  call  (creating  a  put  vs 
strangle/straddle). 

  Calendar put spread collar. If the maturity of the short put is identical to the long (far-
dated) put, then the final position is a calendar put spread collar (i.e. far dated put spread 
funded by sale of short dated calls). The performance of a calendar put spread collar is 
similar to the calendar collar above. 

  Put vs strangle/straddle. If the maturity of the short put is the same as the maturity of 
the short near-dated call, then this position funds the long far-dated put by selling near-
dated volatility via a near dated strangle (or straddle if the strikes of the short put and 
short call are identical).  

Short near dated variance swaps is an alternative to selling near dated 
strangle/straddle 

For  an  investor  who  is  able  to  trade  OTC,  a  similar  strategy  involves  long  put  and  short 
near-dated variance swaps.

1.6: OPTION STRUCTURES TRADING 

While  a  simple  view  on  both  volatility  and  equity  market  direction  can  be 
implemented via a long or short position in a call or put, a far wider set of payoffs is 
possible  if  two  or  three  different  options  are  used.  We  investigate  strategies  using 
option  structures  (or  option  combos)  that  can  be  used  to  meet  different  investor 
needs. 

BULLISH COMBOS ARE REVERSE OF BEARISH 

Using  option  structures  to  implement  a  bearish  strategy  has  already  been  discussed  in  the 
section  1.5  Protection  Strategies  Using  Options.  In  the  same  way  a  long  put  protection  can  be 
cheapened by selling an OTM put against the put protection (to create a put spread giving 
only  partial  protection),  a  call  can  be  cheapened  by  selling  an  OTM  call  (to  create  a  call 
spread offering only partial upside). Similarly, the upside exposure of the call (or call spread) 
can be funded by put underwriting (just as put or put spread protection can be funded by 
call overwriting). The four option structures for bullish strategies are given below. 

  Calls  give  complete  upside  exposure  and  floored  downside.  Calls  are  the  ideal 
instrument for bullish investors as they offer full upside exposure and the maximum loss 
is only the premium paid. Unless the call is short dated or is purchased in a period of 
low volatility, the cost is likely to be high. 

  Call spreads give partial upside but are cheaper. If an underlying is seen as unlikely 
to  rise  significantly,  or  if  a  call  is  too  expensive,  then  selling  an  OTM  call  against  the 
long call (to create a call spread) could be the best bullish strategy. The strike of the call 
sold could be chosen to be in line with a target price or technical resistance level. While 
the upside is limited to the difference between the two strikes, the cost of the strategy is 
normally one-third cheaper than the cost of the call. 

  Risk reversals (short put, long call of different strikes) benefit from selling skew. 
If a long call position is funded by selling a put (to create a risk reversal), the volatility of 
the put sold is normally higher than the volatility of the call bought. The higher skew is, 
the larger this difference and the more attractive this strategy is. Similarly, if interest rates 
are low, then the lower the forward (which lifts the value of the put and decreases the 
value of the call) and the more attractive the strategy is. The profile of this risk reversal 
is similar to being long the underlying. 

  Call  spread  vs  put  is  most  attractive  when  volatility  is  high.  A  long  call  can  be 
funded  by  selling  an  OTM  call  and  OTM  put.  This  strategy  is  best  when  implied 
volatility is high, as two options are sold.

LADDERS HAVE A SIMILAR PROFILE TO 1×2 SPREADS 

With  a  1×2  call  or  put  spread,  two  OTM  options  of  the  same  strike  are  sold  against  one 
(usually near ATM) long option of a different strike. A ladder has exactly the same structure, 
except the two short OTM options have a different strike.The different strikes of the two 
OTM options means that the maximum payout of a ladder is lower than for a 1x2, however 
this  maximum  payout  is  earned  for  a  range  of  values,  not  a  single  value  at  expiry. 
Additionally  the  breakeven  of  a  ladder  is  further  away  from  spot,  giving  the  comfort  that 
markets have to move further for losses to be suffered when compared to a 1x2 call or put 
spread.

STRADDLES AND STRANGLES ARE VERY SIMILAR 

Using option structures allows a straddle (long call and put of same strike) or strangle (long 
call and put of different strikes) to be traded. These structures are long (or short) volatility, 
but do not have any exposure to the direction of the equity market.

Figure  21  below  shows  the  most  common  structures  that  can  be  traded  with  up  to  three 
different  options  in  relation  to  a  view  on  equity  and  volatility  markets.  For  simplicity, 
strangles  and  ladders  are  not  shown,  but  they  can  be  considered  to  be similar  to straddles 
and 1×2 ratio spreads, respectively.

Butterflies  combine  a  short  straddle  with  a  long  strangle,  which  allows  a  short  volatility 
position to be taken with floored losses. We note the theoretical profile of a short calendar 
trade  is  similar  to  trading  a  butterfly  If  an  underlying  does  not  have  liquid  OTM  options, 
then  a  calendar  can  be  used  as  a  butterfly  substitute  (although  this  approach  does  involve 
term structure risk, which a butterfly does not have). A long calendar (short near-dated, long 
far-dated) is therefore short gamma (as the short near-dated option has more gamma than 
the far-dated option).

VOLATILITY TRADING 

We  investigate  the  benefits  and  disadvantages  of  volatility  trading  via  options, 
volatility swaps, variance swaps and gamma swaps. We also show how these products, 
correlation swaps, basket options and covariance swaps can give correlation exposure. 
Recently,  options  on  alternative  underlyings  have  been  created,  such  as  options  on 
variance and options on volatility futures.  We show how the distribution and skew 
for options on variance is different from those for equities (options on volatility futures 
have many similarities to options on variance but are slightly different, and are covered 
in the section 4.5: Options On Volatility Futures).

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

2.1: VOLATILITY TRADING USING OPTIONS 

While  directional  investors  typically  use  options  for  their  equity  exposure,  volatility 
investors delta hedge their equity exposure. A delta-hedged option (call or put) is not 
exposed  to  equity  markets,  but  only  to  volatility  markets.  We  demonstrate  how 
volatility  investors  are  exposed  to  dividend  and  borrow  cost  risk  and  how  volatility 
traders can ‘pin’ a stock approaching expiry. We also show that while the profit from 
delta hedging is based on percentage move squared (ie, variance or volatility2), it is 
the absolute difference between realised and implied that determines carry (not the 
difference between realised2 and implied2). 

VOLATILITY TRADING VIA CALLS & PUTS IS IDENTICAL 

A forward is a contract that obliges the investor to buy (or sell if you have sold the forward) 
a security on a certain expiry date (but not before) at a certain strike price. A portfolio of a 
long European call and a short European put of identical expiry and strike is the same as a 
forward of that expiry and strike, as shown in Figure 23 below. This means that if a call, a put 
or a straddle is delta hedged with a forward contract (not stock), the end profile is identical.

PUT-CALL PARITY IS ONLY TRUE FOR EUROPEAN OPTIONS 

We  note  underlying  is  only  true  for  European  options  as  European  options  cannot  be 
exercised before maturity. It is only approximately true for American options, as American 
options can be exercised before expiry (although in practice they seldom are). 

Delta hedging must be done with forward of identical maturity 

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  delta  hedging  must  be  done  with  a  forward  of  identical 
maturity to the options. If it is done with a different maturity, or with stock, there will be 
dividend  risk.  This  is  because  a  forward,  like  a  European  call  or  put,  gives  the  right  to  a 
security at maturity but does not give the right to any benefits such as dividends that have an 
ex  date  before  expiry.  A  long  forward  position  is  therefore  equal  to  long  stock  and  short 
dividends that go ex before maturity (assuming interest rates and borrow cost are zero or are 
hedged). This can be seen from the diagram below, as a stock will fall by the value of the 
dividend  (subject  to  a  suitable  tax  rate)  on  the  ex  date.  The  dividend  risk  of  an  option  is 
therefore equal to the delta.

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

BORROW COST IMPACT ON OPTION PRICING

From a derivative pricing point of view, borrow cost (or repo) can be added to the dividend. 
This  is  because  it  is  something  that  the  owner  of  the  shares  receives  and  the  owner  of  a 
forward does not. While the borrow cost should, in theory, apply to both the bid and offer 
of calls and puts, in practice an investment bank’s stock borrow desk is usually separate from 
the volatility trading desk (or potentially not all of the long position can be lent out). If the 
traders on the volatility trading desk do not get an internal transfer of the borrow cost, then 
only one side of the trade (the side that has positive delta for the volatility trading desk, or 
negative  delta  for  the  client)  usually  includes  the  borrow  cost.  This  is  shown  in  Figure  25 
below. While the borrow cost is not normally more than 40bp for General Collateral (GC) 
names, it can be more substantial for emerging market (EM) names. If borrow cost is only 
included in one leg of pricing, it creates a bid-offer arbitrage channel.

Zero delta straddles still need to include borrow cost on one leg  

Like  dividends,  the  exposure  to  borrow  cost  is  equal  to  the  delta.  However,  a  zero  delta 
straddle  still  has  exposure  to  borrow  cost  because  it  should  be  priced  as  the  sum  of  two 
separate trades, one call and one put. As one of the legs of the trade should include borrow, 
so does a straddle. This is particularly important for EM or other high borrow cost names. 

Zero delta straddles have strike above spot 

A common misperception is that ATM options have a 50% delta; hence, an ATM straddle 
has to be zero delta. In fact, a zero delta straddle has to have a strike above spot (an ATM 
straddle has negative delta). The strike of a zero delta straddle is given below.

DELTA HEDGING AN OPTION REMOVES EQUITY RISK 

If an option is purchased at an implied volatility that is lower than the realised volatility over 
the life of the option, then the investor, in theory, earns a profit from buying cheap volatility. 
However,  the  effect  of  buying  cheap  volatility  is  dwarfed  by  the  profit  or  loss  from  the 
direction  of  the  equity  market.  For  this  reason,  directional  investors  are  usually  more 
concerned  with  premium  rather  than  implied  volatility.  Volatility  investors  will,  however, 
hedge  the  equity  exposure.  This  will  result  in  a  position  whose  profitability  is  solely 
determined by the volatility (not direction) of the underlying. As delta measures the equity 
sensitivity of an option, removing equity exposure is called delta hedging (as a portfolio with 
no equity exposure has delta = 0). 

Delta hedging example 

As the delta of a portfolio is equal to the sum of the deltas of the securities in the portfolio, a 
position can be delta hedged by purchasing, or going short, a number of shares (or futures in 
the case of an index) equal to the delta. For example, if ten call options have been bought 
with  a  delta  of  40%,  then  four  shares  (10  ×  40%  =  4)  have  to  be  shorted  to  create  a 
portfolio  of  zero  delta.  The  shares  have  to  be  shorted  as  a  call  option  has  positive  delta; 
hence, the delta hedge has to be negative for the sum of the two positions to have zero delta. 
If we were long a put (which has negative delta), then we would have to buy stock to ensure 
the overall delta was zero.

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

Constant delta hedging is called gamma scalping 

The rate delta changes as spot moves is called gamma; hence, gamma is the convexity of the 
payout. As the delta changes, a volatility investor has to delta hedge in order to ensure there 
is  no  equity  exposure.  Constantly  delta  hedging  in  this way  is  called  gamma  scalping,  as  it 
ensures a long volatility position earns a profit as spot moves. 

Gamma scalping (delta re-hedging) locks in profit as underlying moves 

We  shall  assume  an  investor  has  purchased  a  zero  delta  straddle  (or  strangle),  but  the 
argument will hold for long call or put positions as well. If equity markets fall (from position 
1 to position 2 in the chart) the position will become profitable and the delta will decrease 
from zero to a negative value. In order to lock in the profit, the investor must buy stock (or 
futures)  for  the  portfolio  to  return  to  zero  delta.  Now  that  the  portfolio  is  equity  market 
neutral, it will profit from a movement up or down in the equity market. If equity markets 
then rise, the initial profit will be kept and a further profit earned (movement from position 
2  to  position  3).  At  position  3  the  stock  (or  futures)  position  is  sold  and  a  short  position 
initiated to return the position to zero delta.

Long gamma position can sit on the bid and offer 

As shown above, a long gamma (long volatility) position has to buy shares if they fall, and 
sell them if they rise. Buying low and selling high earns the investor a profit. Additionally, as 
a gamma scalper can enter bids and offers away from current spot, there is no need to cross 
the spread (as a long gamma position can be delta hedged by sitting on the bid and offer).  

Short gamma position have to cross the bid-offer spread 

A short gamma position represents the reverse situation, and requires crossing the spread to 
delta hedge. While this hidden cost is small, it could be substantial over the long term for 
underlyings with relatively wide bid-offer spreads. 

Best to delta hedge on key dates or on turn of market 

If  markets  have  a  clear  direction  (ie,  they  are  trending),  it  is  best  to  delta  hedge  less 
frequently. However, in choppy markets that are range bound it is best to delta hedge very 
frequently.  For  more  detail  on  how  hedging  frequency  affects  returns  and  the  path 
dependency of returns, see the section 3.5 Stretching Black-Scholes Assumptions. If there is a key 
announcement  (either  economic  or  earnings-related  to  affect  the  underlying),  it  is  best  to 
delta hedge just before the announcement to ensure that profit is earned from any jump (up 
or down) that occurs. 

OPTION TRADING RULES OF THUMB 

To calculate option premiums and volatility exactly is typically too difficult to do without the 
aid  of  a  tool.  However,  there  are  some  useful rules  of  thumb  that  can  be  used  to give  an 
estimate. These are a useful sanity check in case an input to a pricing model has been entered 
incorrectly. 

  Historical  volatility  roughly  equal  to  16  ×  percentage  daily  move.  Historical 
volatility can be estimated by multiplying the typical return over a period by the square 
root of the number of periods in a year (eg, 52 weeks or 12 months in a year). Hence, if 
a  security  moves  1%  a  day,  it  has  an  annualised  volatility  of  16%  (as  there  are  c252 
trading days and 16 ≈ √252). 

  ATM option premium in percent is roughly 0.4 × volatility × square root of time. 
If one assumes zero interest rates and dividends, then the formula for the premium of 
an  ATM  call  or  put  option  simplifies  to  0.4  ×  σ  ×  √T.  Therefore,  a  one-year  ATM 
option  on  an  underlying  with  20%  implied  is  worth  c8%  (=  0.4  ×  20%  ×  √1).  OTM 
options can be calculated from this estimate using an estimated 50% delta. 

  Profit from delta hedging is proportional to square of return. Due to the convexity 
of an option, if the volatility is doubled the profits from delta hedging are multiplied by a 
factor  of  four.  For  this  reason,  variance  (squared  returns)  is  a  better  measure  of 
deviation than volatility. 

 
42 

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

  Difference  between  implied  and  realised  determines  carry.  While  variance  is  the 
driver of profits if the implied volatility of an option is constant, the carry is determined 
by the absolute difference between realised and implied (ie, the same carry is earned by 
going  long  a  20%  implied  option  that  realises  21%  as  by  going  long  a  40%  implied 
option that realises 41%. 

ANNUALISED VOL = 16 × PERCENTAGE DAILY MOVE 

Volatility is defined as the annualised standard deviation of log returns (where return = Pi / Pi-
1). As returns are normally close to 1 (=100%) the log of returns is very similar to ‘return – 1’ 
(which is the percentage change of the price). Hence, to calculate the annualised volatility for 
a given percentage move, all that is needed is to annualise the percentage change in the price. 
This  is  done  by  multiplying  the  percentage  move  by  the  square  root  of  the  number  of 
samples  in  a  year  (as  volatility  is  the  square  root  of  variance).  For  example,  market 
convention is to assume there are approximately 252 trading days a year. If a stock moves 
1% a day, then its volatility is 1%×√252, which is approximately 1%×16 = 16% volatility. 
Similarly, if a stock moves 2% a day it has 32% volatility. 

Num of trading days in year   = 252   => Multiply daily returns by √252   

≈ 16 

Num of weeks in year  

= 52     => Multiply weekly returns by √52  

≈ 7 

Num of months in year     

= 12     => Multiply monthly returns by √12   ≈ 3.5 

HEDGING CAN ‘PIN’ A STOCK APPROACHING EXPIRY 

As an investor who is long gamma can delta hedge by sitting on the bid and offer, this trade 
can pin an underlying to the strike. This is a side effect of selling if the stock rises above the 
strike, and buying if the stock falls below the strike. The amount of buying and selling has to 
be  significant  compared  with  the  traded  volume  of  the  underlying,  which  is  why  pinning 
normally  occurs  for  relatively  illiquid  stocks  or  where  the  position  is  particularly  sizeable. 
Given the high trading volume of indices, it is difficult to pin a major index. Pinning is more 
likely to occur in relatively calm markets, where there is no strong trend to drive the stock 
away from its pin.

Large size of Swisscom convertible pinned underlying for many months 

One of the most visible examples of pinning occurred in late 2004/early 2005, due to a large 
Swiss  government  debt  issue,  (Swisscom  0%  2005)  convertible  into  the  relatively  illiquid 
Swisscom shares. As the shares traded close to the strike approaching maturity, the upward 
trend  of  the  stock  was  broken.  Swisscom  was  pinned  for  two  to  three  months  until  the 
exchangeable expired.  

Pinned stocks snap back to fair value after expiration 

After expiration, the stock snapped back to where it would have been if the upward trend 
had not been paused. A similar event occurred to AXA in the month preceding the Jun05 
expiry, when it was pinned close to €20 despite the broader market rising (after expiry AXA 
rose 4% in four days).

Example 1 

A 1 year ATM option on an underlying with 20% implied is worth c.8% (=0.4 × 20% × √1) 

Example 2 

A 3 month ATM option on an underlying with 20% implied is worth c.4% (=0.4 × 20% × 
√0.25 =0.4 × 20% × 0.5) 

OTM options can be calculated by assuming 50% delta 

If  an  index  is  3000pts  and  has  a  20%  implied  then  the  price  of  a  1Y  ATM  option  is 
approximately 240pts (3000×8% as calculated in Example 1 above). A 3200 call is therefore 
approximately  240  –  50%  (3200-3000)  =  240  –  100  =  140pts  assuming  a  50%  delta. 
Similarly, a 3200 put is approximately 340pts (240 + 100).

PROFIT PROPORTIONAL TO PERCENT MOVE SQUARED 

Due to the convexity of an option, if the volatility is doubled, the profits from delta hedging 
are multiplied by a factor of four. For this reason, variance (which looks at squared returns) 
is  a  better  measure  of  deviation  than  volatility.  Assuming  constant  volatility,  zero  interest 
rates  and  dividend,  the  daily  profit  and  loss  (P&L)  from  delta  hedging  an  option  is  given 
below. 

Daily P&L = Delta P&L + Gamma P&L + Theta P&L 

  Daily P&L = Sδ + S2γ /2 + tθ  

where S is change in Stock  

  Daily P&L - Sδ = + S2γ /2 + tθ = Delta hedged P&L 

  Delta hedged P&L = S2γ /2 + cost term  

 (tθ does not depend on stock price) 

where: 

δ   = delta 

γ  = gamma 

t 

= time 

θ  = theta 

If the effect of theta is ignored (as it is a cost that does not depend on the size of the stock 
price  movement),  the  profit  of  a  delta  hedged  option  position  is  equal  to  a  scaling  factor 
(gamma/2)  multiplied  by  the  square  of  the  return.  This  means  that  the  profit  from  a  2% 
move in a stock price is four times (22=4) the profit from a 1% move in stock price. 

This can also be seen from Figure 29 below, as the additional profit from the move from 1% 
to 2% is three times the profit from 0% to 1% (for a total profit four times the profit for a 
1% move).

Make same delta hedge profit with 1% a day move as 2% every four days 

Let’s assume there are two stocks: one of them moves 1% a day and the other 2% every four 
days (see Figure 30). Both stocks have the same 16% volatility and delta hedging them earns 
the same profit (as four times as much profit is earned on the days the stock moves 2% as 
when it moves 1%).

IMPLIED - REALISED = CARRY 

Assuming all other inputs are constant, the payout of a delta-hedged option is based on the 
variance  (return  squared).  However,  when  examining  how  much  carry  is  earned,  or  lost, 
when delta hedging an option, it is the difference between realised and implied (not realised2 
-  implied2)  that  matters.  This  is  because  the  gamma  of  an  option  is  proportional  to  1/σ; 
hence, if volatility doubles the gamma halves. Thus, the same carry (profit from gamma less 
cost of theta) is earned by going long a 20% implied option that realises 21% as by going 
long a 40% implied option that realises 41%. The proof of this is below. 

Delta hedged P&L = Dollar gamma × (return2 - σ2dt) 

where: 

σ   = implied volatility 

γ   = - N’(d1) / (S × σ × √T)   

Dollar gamma  = 0.5 × γ × S2 ≈ constant / σ for constant spot S and time T 

  Daily P&L ≈ constant × (return2 - σ2dt) / σ 

If we define return to be similar to volatility, then return = (σ + x)dt where x is small 

  Daily P&L ≈ constant × dt × ((σ + x)2 - σ2) / σ  

 
 
 
48 

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

  Daily P&L ≈ constant × dt × ((σ2 + 2σx + x2) - σ2) / σ  

  Daily P&L ≈ constant × dt × (2x + x2/σ)  

  Daily P&L ≈ constant × dt × 2x as x is small 

Daily P&L proportional to x, where x = realised volatility - σ 

Hence, it is the difference between realised and implied volatility that is the key to daily P&L 
(or carry). 

 
 
2.2: Variance Is the Key, Not Volatility

2.2: VARIANCE IS THE KEY, NOT VOLATILITY 

Partly  due  to  its  use  in  Black-Scholes,  historically,  volatility  has  been  used  as  the 
measure of deviation for financial assets. However, the correct measure of deviation 
is variance (or volatility squared). Volatility should be considered to be a derivative of 
variance.  The  realisation  that  variance  should  be  used  instead  of  volatility  led 
volatility indices, such as the VIX, to move away from ATM volatility (VXO index) 
towards a variance-based calculation. 

VAR, NOT VOL, IS CORRECT MEASURE FOR DEVIATION 

There are three reasons why variance, not volatility, should be used as the correct measure 
for  volatility.  However,  despite  these  reasons,  even  variance  swaps  are  normally  quoted  as 
the square root of variance for an easier comparison with the implied volatility of options 
(but  we  note  that  skew  and  convexity  mean  the  fair  price  of  variance  should  always  trade 
above ATM options). 

  Variance  takes  into  account  implied  volatility  at  all  stock  prices.  Variance  takes  into 
account the implied volatility of all strikes with the same expiry (while ATM implied will change 
with spot, even if volatility surface does not change). 

  Deviations need to be squared to avoid cancelling. Mathematically, if deviations were simply 
summed  then  positive  and  negative  deviations  would  cancel.  This  is  why  the  sum  of  squared 
deviations is taken (variance) to prevent the deviations from cancelling. Taking the square root of 
this  sum  (volatility)  should  be  considered  a  derivative  of  this  pure  measure  of  deviation 
(variance). 

  Profit  from  a  delta-hedged  option  depends  on  the  square  of  the  return.  Due  to  the 
convexity of an option, if the volatility is doubled, the profits from delta hedging are multiplied 
by a factor of four. For this reason, variance (which looks at squared returns) is a better measure 
of deviation than volatility. 

50 

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

(1)  VARIANCE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VOLATILITY AT ALL STOCK PRICES 

When looking at how rich or cheap options with the same maturity are, rather than looking 
at the implied volatility for a certain strike (ie, ATM or another suitable strike) it is better to 
look at the implied variance as it takes into account the implied volatility of all strikes. For 
example, if an option with a fixed strike that is initially ATM is bought, then as soon as spot 
moves it is no longer ATM. However, if a variance swap (or log contract3 of options in the 
absence of a variance swap market) is bought, then its traded level is applicable no matter 
what the level of spot. The fact a variance swap (or log contract) payout depends only on the 
realised variance and is not path dependent makes it the ideal measure for deviation. 

(2)  DEVIATIONS NEED TO BE SQUARED TO AVOID CANCELLING 

If a seesaw has two weights on it and the weights are the same distance either side from the 
pivot, the weights are balanced as the centre of the mass is in line with the pivot (see graph 
on  left  hand side below). If  the  weights  are  further  away  from  the pivot  the  centre  of  the 
mass (hence the average/expected distance of the weights) is still in line with the pivot (see 
graph  on  right  hand  side  below).  If  the  deviation  of  the  two  weights  from  the  pivot  is 
summed  together,  in  both  cases  they  would  be  zero  (as  one  weight’s  deviation  from  the 
pivot is the negative of the other). In order to avoid the deviation cancelling this way, the 
square of the deviation (or variance) is taken, as the square of a number is always positive.

(3)  PROFIT FROM DELTA HEDGING PROPORTIONAL TO RETURN SQUARED 

Assuming constant volatility, zero interest rates and dividend, the daily profit and loss (P&L) 
from delta hedging an option is given below: 

Delta-hedged P&L from option = S2γ /2 + cost term 

where: 

γ

2.2: Variance Is the Key, Not Volatility 

51 

This  can  also  be  seen  from  Figure  29  Profile  of  a  Delta-Hedged  Option  in  the  previous 
section (page 46), as the additional profit from the move from 1% to 2% is three times the 
profit from 0% to 1% (for a total profit four times the profit for a 1% move). 

VOL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A DERIVATIVE OF VAR 

The three examples above show why variance is the natural measure for deviation. Volatility, 
the square root of variance, should be considered a derivative of variance rather than a pure 
measure  of  deviation.  It  is  variance,  not  volatility,  that  is  the  second  moment  of  a 
distribution  (the  first  moment  is  the  forward  or  expected  price).  For  more  details  on 
moments, read the section 7.4 How to Measure Skew and Smile. 

VIX CALCULATION MOVED FROM ATM VOL TO VAR 

Due to the realisation that variance, not volatility, was the correct measure of deviation, on 
Monday, September 22, 2003, the VIX index moved away from using ATM implied towards 
a  variance-based  calculation.  Variance-based  calculations  have  also  been  used  for  by  other 
volatility index providers. The old VIX, renamed VXO, took the implied volatility for strikes 
above and below spot for both calls and puts. As the first two-month expiries were used, the 
old index was an average of eight implied volatility measures as 8 = 2 (strikes) × 2 (put/call) 
× 2 (expiry). We note that the use of the first two expiries (excluding the front month if it 
was less than eight calendar days) meant the maturity was on average 1.5 months, not one 
month as for the new VIX. 

VDAX calculation also moved from ATM vol to var 

Similarly,  the  VDAX  index,  which  was  based  on  45-day  ATM-implied  volatility,  has  been 
superseded by the V1X index, which, like the new VIX, uses a variance swap calculation. All 
recent volatility indices, such as the vStoxx (V2X), VSMI (V3X), VFTSE, VNKY and VHSI, 
use  a  variance  swap  calculation,  although  we  note  the  recent  VIMEX  index  uses  a  similar 
methodology to the old VIX (potentially due to illiquidity of OTM options on the Mexbol 
index). 

VARIANCE TERM STRUCTURE IS NOT ALWAYS FLAT 

While  average  variance  term  structure  should  be  flat  in  theory,  in  practice  supply  and 
demand imbalances can impact variance term structure. The buying of protection at the long 
end should mean that variance term structure is on average upward sloping, but in turbulent 
markets it is usually inverted. 

 
 
52 

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

2.3: VOLATILITY, VARIANCE AND GAMMA SWAPS 

In  theory,  the  profit  and  loss  from  delta  hedging  an  option  is  fixed  and  is  based 
solely  on  the  difference  between  the  implied  volatility  of  the  option  when  it  was 
purchased  and  the  realised  volatility  over  the  life  of  the  option.  In  practice,  with 
discrete delta hedging and unknown future volatility, this is not the case, leading to 
the  creation  of  volatility,  variance  and  gamma  swaps.  These  products  also  remove 
the  need  to  continuously  delta  hedge,  which  can  be  very  labour-intensive  and 
expensive. Until the credit crunch, variance swaps were the most liquid of the three, 
but now volatility swaps are more popular for single stocks. 

VOL, VAR & GAMMA SWAPS GIVE PURE VOL EXPOSURE 

As spot moves away from the strike of an option the gamma decreases, and it becomes more 
difficult to profit via delta hedging. Second-generation volatility products, such as volatility 
swaps,  variance  swaps  and  gamma  swaps,  were  created  to  give  volatility  exposure  for  all 
levels of spot and also to avoid the overhead and cost of delta hedging. While volatility and 
variance  swaps  have  been  traded  since  1993,  they  became  more  popular  post-1998,  when 
Russia defaulted on its debts and Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) collapsed.  

Variance and gamma swaps usually quoted in volatility terms 

Variance and gamma swaps are normally quoted as the square root of variance. This allows 
easier comparison with the options market. 

VOLATILITY SWAP ≤ GAMMA SWAP ≤ VARIANCE SWAP 

The square root of the variance strike is always above volatility swaps (and ATMf implied as 
volatility swaps ≈ ATMf implied). This is due to the fact a variance swap payout is convex 
(hence, will always be greater than or equal to volatility swap payout of identical vega, which 
is  explained  later  in  the  section).  Only  for  the  unrealistic  case  of  no  vol  of  vol  (ie,  future 
volatility is constant and known) will the price of a volatility swap and variance swap (and 
gamma swap) be the same4. The fair price of a gamma swap is between volatility swaps and 
variance swaps. 

4 A variance swap payout is based on cash return assuming zero mean, whereas a delta-hedged option 
variance  payout  is  based  on  a  forward.  Hence,  a  variance  swap  fair  price  will  be  slightly  above  a 
constant and flat volatility surface if the drift is non-zero (as close-to-close cash returns will be lifted by 
the drift). 

 
 
                                                      
2.3: Volatility, Variance and Gamma Swaps 

53 

  Volatility swaps. Volatility swaps were the first product to be traded significantly and 
became increasingly popular in the late 1990s until interest migrated to variance swaps. 
Following the collapse of the single-stock variance market in the credit crunch, they are 
having a renaissance due to demand from dispersion traders. A theoretical drawback of 
volatility swaps is the fact that they require a volatility of volatility (vol of vol) model for 
pricing,  as  options  need  to  be  bought  and  sold  during  the  life  of  the  contract  (which 
leads  to  higher  trading  costs).  However,  in  practice,  the  vol  of  vol  risk  is  small  and 
volatility swaps trade roughly in line with ATM forward (ATMf) implied volatility. 

  Variance swaps. The difficulty in hedging volatility swaps drove liquidity towards the 
variance  swap  market,  particularly  during  the  2002  equity  collapse.  As  variance  swaps 
can be replicated by delta hedging a static portfolio of options, it is not necessary to buy 
or sell options during the life of the contract. The problem with this replication is that it 
assumes options of all strikes can be bought, but in reality very OTM options are either 
not  listed  or  not  liquid.  Selling  a  variance  swap  and  only  hedging  with  the  available 
roughly  ATM  options  leaves  the  vendor  short  tail  risk.  As  the  payout  is  on  variance, 
which is volatility squared, the amount can be very significant. For this reason, liquidity 
on single-stock variance disappeared in the credit crunch. 

  Gamma  swaps.  Dispersion  traders  profit  from  overpriced  index-implied  volatility  by 
going  long  single-stock  variance  and  short  index  variance.  The  portfolio  of  variance 
swaps  is  not  static;  hence,  rebalancing  trading  costs  are  incurred.  Investment  banks 
attempted to create a liquid gamma swap market, as dispersion can be implemented via a 
static portfolio of gamma swaps (and, hence, it could better hedge the exposure of their 
books from selling structured products). However, liquidity never really took off due to 
limited interest from other market participants. 

(1) VOLATILITY SWAPS 

The payout of a volatility swap is simply the notional, multiplied by the difference between 
the realised volatility and the fixed swap volatility agreed at the time of trading. As can be 
seen from the payoff formula below, the profit and loss is completely path independent as it 
is solely based on the realised volatility. Volatility swaps were previously illiquid, but are now 
more popular with dispersion traders, given the single stock variance market no longer exists 
post  credit  crunch.  Unless  packaged  as  a  dispersion,  volatility  swaps  rarely  trade.  As 
dispersion  is  short  index  volatility,  long  single  stock  volatility,  single  stock  volatility  swaps 
tend to be bid only (and index volatility swaps offered only).

(2) VARIANCE SWAPS 

Variance  swaps  are  identical  to  volatility  swaps  except  their  payout  is  based  on  variance 
(volatility  squared)  rather  than  volatility.  Variance  swaps  are  long  skew  (more  exposure  to 
downside put options than upside calls) and convexity (more exposure to OTM options than 
ATM).  Typically  variance  swaps  trade  in  line  with  the  30  delta  put  (if  skew  is  downward 
sloping as normal). One-year variance swaps are the most frequently traded.

CAPPED VAR SWAPS ARE SHORT OPTION ON VAR 

Variance  swaps  on  single  stocks  and  emerging  market  indices  are  normally  capped  at  2.5 
times  the  strike,  in  order  to  prevent  the  payout  from  rising  towards  infinity  in  a  crisis  or 
bankruptcy.  A  cap  on  a  variance  swap  can  be  modelled  as  a  vanilla  variance  swap  less  an 
option  on  variance  whose  strike  is  equal  to  the  cap.  More  details  can  be  found  in  the 
section 2.4 Options on Variance. 

Capped var should be hedged with OTM calls, not OTM puts 

The presence of a cap on a variance swap means that if it is to be hedged by only one option 
it should be a slightly OTM call, not an OTM (approx delta 30) put. This is to ensure the 
option is so far OTM when the cap is hit that the hedge disappears. If this is not done, then 
if a trader is long a capped variance swap he would hedge by going short an OTM put. If 

 
2.3: Volatility, Variance and Gamma Swaps 

55 

markets fall with high volatility hitting the cap, the trader would be naked short a (now close 
to ATM) put. Correctly hedging the cap is more important than hedging the skew position. 

S&P500 variance market is increasing in liquidity 

The  payout  of  volatility  swaps  and  variance  swaps  of  the  same  vega  is  similar  for  small 
payouts, but for large payouts the difference becomes very significant due to the quadratic 
(ie,  squared)  nature  of  variance.  The  losses  suffered  in  the  credit  crunch  from  the  sale  of 
variance  swaps,  particularly  single  stock  variance  (which,  like  single  stock  volatility  swaps 
now,  was  typically  bid  only),  have  weighed  on  their  subsequent  liquidity.  Now  variance 
swaps  only  trade  for  indices  (usually  without  cap,  but  sometimes  with).  The  popularity  of 
VIX  futures  has  raised  awareness  of  variance  swaps,  which  has  helped  S&P500  variance 
swaps become more liquid than they were before the credit crunch. SX5E variance liquidity 
used to be in line with the S&P500, but is now far less liquid. 

CORRIDOR VARIANCE SWAPS ARE  NOT LIQUID 

As volatility and spot are correlated, volatility buyers would typically only want exposure to 
volatility levels for low values of spot. Conversely, volatility sellers would only want exposure 
for high values of spot. To satisfy this demand, corridor variance swaps were created. These 
only have exposure when spot is between spot values A and B. If A is zero, then it is a down 
variance swap. If B is infinity, it is an up variance swap. There is only a swap payment on 
those  days  the  spot  is  in  the  required  range,  so  if  spot  is  never  in  the  range  there  is  no 
payment. Because of this, a down variance swap and up variance swap with the same spot 
barrier is simply a vanilla variance swap. The liquidity of corridor variance swaps was always 
far lower than for variance swaps and, post credit crunch, they are rarely traded. 

Corridor variance swap payoff 

(σF when in corridor2 - σS2) × variance notional × percentage of days spot is within corridor 

where: 

σF when in corridor = future volatility (of returns Pi/Pi-1 which occur when BL < Pi-1 ≤ BH) 

BL and BH, are the lower and higher barriers, where BL could be 0 and BH could be infinity. 

(3) GAMMA SWAPS 

The payout of gamma swaps is identical to that of a variance swap, except the daily P&L is 
weighted  by  spot  (pricen)  divided  by  the  initial  spot  (price0).  If  spot range  trades  after  the 
position is initiated, the payouts of a gamma swap are virtually identical to the payout of a 
variance swap. Should spot decline, the payout of a gamma swap decreases. Conversely, if 
spot  increases,  the  payout  of  a  gamma  swap  increases.  This  spot-weighting  of  a  variance 
swap payout has the following attractive features: 

 
56 

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

  Spot  weighting  of  gamma  swap  payout  makes  it  unnecessary  to  have  a  cap,  even  for 
single  stocks (if  a  company  goes  bankrupt  with  spot  dropping  close  to  zero  with very 
high  volatility,  multiplying  the  payout  by  spot  automatically  prevents  an  excessive 
payout). 

  If a dispersion trade uses gamma swaps, the amount of gamma swaps needed does not 
change over time (hence, the trade is ‘fire and forget’, as the constituents do not have to 
be rebalanced as they would if variance swaps were used). 

  A gamma swap can be replicated by a static portfolio of options (although a different 
static portfolio to variance swaps), which reduces hedging costs. Hence, no volatility of 
volatility model is needed (unlike volatility swaps). 

Gamma swap market has never had significant liquidity 

A number of investment banks attempted to kick start a liquid gamma swap market, partly 
to  satisfy  potential  demand  from  dispersion  traders  and  partly  to  get  rid  of  some  of  the 
exposure from selling structured products (if the product has less volatility exposure if prices 
fall, then a gamma swap better matches the change in the vega profile when spot moves). 
While  the  replication  of  the  product  is  as  trivial  as  for  variance  swaps,  it  was  difficult  to 
convince  other  market  participants  to  switch  to  the  new  product  and  liquidity  stayed  with 
variance swaps (although after the credit crunch, single-stock variance liquidity moved to the 
volatility  swap  market).  If  the  gamma  swap  market  ever  gains  liquidity,  long  skew  trades 
could  be  put  on  with  a  long  variance-short  gamma  swap  position  (as  this  would  be  long 
downside volatility and short upside volatility, as a gamma swap payout decreases/increases 
with spot).

57 

PAYOUT OF VOL, VAR AND GAMMA SWAPS  

The payout of volatility swaps, variance swaps and gamma swaps is the difference between 
the fixed and floating leg, multiplied by the notional. The calculation for volatility assumes 
zero  mean  return  (or  zero  drift)  to  make  the  calculation  easier  and  to  allow  the  variance 
calculation to be additive. 

  Fixed leg. The cost (or fixed leg) of going long a volatility, variance or gamma swap is 
always  based  on  the  swap  price,  σS  (which  is  fixed  at  inception  of  the  contract).  The 
fixed leg is σS for volatility swaps, but is σS

2 for variance and gamma swaps). 

  Floating leg. The payout (or floating leg) for volatility and variance swaps is based on 
the same variable σF (see equation below). The only difference is that a volatility swap 
payout is based on σF, whereas for a variance swap it is σF
2. The gamma swap payout is 
based on a similar variable σG

2 multiplied by pricen/price0.

58 

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

Basis risk between cash and futures can cause traders problems 

We note that the payout of variance swaps is based on the cash close, but traders normally 
delta  hedge  using  futures.  The  difference  between  the  cash  and  futures  price  is  called  the 
basis, and the risk due to a change in basis is called basis risk. Traders have to take this basis 
risk  between  the  cash  close  and  futures  close,  which  can  be  significant  as  liquidity  in  the 
futures market tends to be reduced after the cash market closes. 

VOL, VAR AND GAMMA SWAPS ARE ACTUALLY FORWARDS 

The naming of volatility swaps, variance swaps and gamma swaps is misleading, as they are 
in fact forwards. This is because their payoff is at maturity, whereas swaps have intermediate 
payments. 

VARIANCE IS ADDITIVE WITH ZERO MEAN ASSUMPTION 

Normally, standard deviation or variance looks at the deviation from the mean. The above 
calculations  assume  a  zero  mean,  which  simplifies  the  calculation  (typically,  one  would 
expect the mean daily return to be relatively small). With a zero mean assumption, variance is 
additive.  A  mathematical  proof  of  the  formula  below  is  given  in  the  section  A2  Measuring 
Historical Volatility in the Appendix. 

Past variance + future variance = total variance 

Lack of dividend adjustment for indices affects pricing 

The  return  calculation  for  a  variance  swap  on  an  index  does  not  adjust  for  any  dividend 
payments that go ex. This means that the dividend modelling method can affect the pricing. 
Near-dated  and,  hence,  either  known  or  relatively  certain  dividends  should  be  modelled 
discretely  rather  than  as  a  flat  yield.  The  changing  exposure  of  the  variance  swap  to  the 
volatility on the ex date can be as large as 0.5 volatility points for a three-year variance swap 
(if all other inputs are kept constant, discrete (ie, fixed) dividends lift the value of both calls 
and  puts,  as  proportional  dividends  simply  reduce  the  volatility  of  the  underlying  by  the 
dividend yield). 

Calculation agents have discretion as to when a market disruption occurs 

Normally, the investment bank is the calculation agent for any variance swaps traded. As the 
calculation agent normally has some discretion over when a market disruption event occurs, 
this can lead to cases where one calculation agent believes a market disruption occurs and 
another does not. This led to a number of disputes in 2008, as it was not clear if a market or 
exchange  disruption  had  occurred.  Similarly,  if  a  stock  is  delisted,  the  estimate  of  future 
volatility  for  settlement  prices  is  unlikely  to  be  identical  between  firms,  which  can  lead  to

HEDGING OF VAR CAN IMPACT EQUITY & VOL MARKET 

Hedging  volatility,  variance  and  gamma  swaps  always  involve  the  trading  of  a  strip  of 
options  of  all  strikes  and  delta  hedging  at  the  close.  The  impact  the  hedging  of  all  three 
products has on equity and volatility markets is similar, but we shall use the term variance 
swaps,  as  it  has  by  far  the  most  impact  of  the  three  (the  same  arguments  will  apply  for 
volatility swaps and gamma swaps). 

Short end of volatility surfaces is now pinned to realised 

If  there  is  a  divergence  between  short-dated  variance  swaps  and  realised  volatility,  hedge 
funds will put on variance swap trades to profit from this divergence. This puts pressure on 
the  short-dated  end  of  volatility  surfaces  to  trade  close  to  the  current  levels  of  realised 
volatility. Due to the greater risk of unexpected events, it is riskier to attempt a similar trade 
at the longer-dated end of volatility surfaces. 

Skew levels affected by direction of volatility trading 

As  variance  swaps  became  a  popular  way  to  express  a  view  of  the  direction  of  implied 
volatility, they impacted the levels of skew. This occurred as variance swaps are long skew 
(explained below) and, if volatility is being sold through variance swaps, this weighs on skew. 
This  occurred  between  2003  and  2005,  which  pushed  skew  to  a  multiple-year  low.  As 
volatility bottomed, the pressure from variance swap selling abated and skew recovered.  

Delta hedge can suppress or exaggerate market moves 

As  the  payout  of  variance  swaps  is  based  on  the  close-to-close  return,  they  all  have  an 
intraday  delta  (which  is  equal  to  zero  if  spot  is  equal  to  the  previous  day’s  close).  As  this 
intraday delta resets to zero at the end of the day, the hedging of these products requires a 
delta hedge at the cash close. A rule of thumb is that the direction of hedging flow is in the 
direction that makes the trade the least profit (ensuring that if a trade is crowded, it makes 
less money). This flow can be hundreds of millions of US dollars or euros per day, especially 
when structured products based on selling short-dated variance are popular (as they were in 
2006 and 2007, less so since the high volatility of the credit crunch). 

  Variance  buying  suppresses  equity  market  moves.  If  clients  are  net  buyers  of 
variance swaps, they leave the counterparty trader short. The trader will hedge this short 
position by buying a portfolio of options and delta hedging them on the close. If spot 
has  risen  over  the  day  the  position  (which  was  originally  delta-neutral)  has  a  positive 
delta (in the same way as a delta-hedged straddle would have a positive delta if markets 
rise). The end of day hedge of this position requires selling the underlying (to become 
delta-flat),  which  suppresses  the  rise  of  spot.  Similarly,  if  markets  fall,  the  delta  hedge 
required is to buy the underlying, again suppressing the market movement. 

 
 
60 

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

  Variance selling exaggerates equity market moves. Should clients be predominantly 
selling  variance  swaps,  the  hedging  of  these  products  exaggerates  market  moves.  The 
argument is simply the inverse of the argument above. The trader who is long a variance 
swap (as the client is short) has hedged by selling a portfolio of options. If markets rise, 
the delta of the position is negative and, as the variance swap delta is reset to zero at the 
end of the day, the trader has to buy equities at the same time (causing the close to be 
lifted for underlyings that have increased in value over the day). If markets fall, then the 
trader  has  to  sell  equities  at  the  end  of  the  day  (as  the  delta  of  a  short  portfolio  of 
options  is  positive).  Movements  are  therefore  exaggerated,  and  realised  volatility 
increases if clients have sold variance swaps. 

VAR PRICING CHANGED POST THE 2008 SPIKE IN VOL 

The turmoil seen in 2008 caused 3-month realised volatility to spike above 70%. This was 
higher  than  the  mid-60’s  high  reached  during  the  Great  Depression.  Before  the  Lehman 
bankruptcy, volatility traders used to cap implied volatility surfaces at a level similar to the 
all-time highs of realised volatility. The realisation that there could be an event that occurs in 
the future that has not occurred in the past, a so called ‘black swan’, has removed this cap (as 
it is now understood that volatility can spike above historical highs in a severe crisis).

Removal of the implied vol cap has lifted var swap levels 

The removal of the cap on implied volatility has caused low strike puts to be priced with a 
far  higher  implied  volatility5.  While  the  effect  on  premium  for  vanilla  options  (where  the 
time value of very low strike puts is small) is small, for variance swaps the effect is very large. 
As  variance  swaps  are  more  sensitive  to  low  strike  implied  volatility  (shown  below),  the 
removal of the cap lifted levels of variance swaps from c2pts above ATMf to c7pts above 
(which has since fallen to 3-4pts above). 

HEDGING VOL, VAR AND GAMMA SWAPS  

As volatility, variance and gamma swaps give volatility exposure for all values of spot, they 
need to be hedged by a portfolio of options of every strike. An equal-weighted portfolio is 
not suitable, as the vega profile of an option increases in size and width as strike increases 
(ie, an option of strike 2K has a peak vega double the peak vega of an option of strike K and 
is also twice the width). This is shown below.

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

Variance swaps are hedged with portfolio weighted 1/K2 
Because a variance swap has a flat vega profile, the correct hedge is a portfolio of options 
weighted 1/K2 (where K is the strike of the option, ie, each option is weighted by 1 divided 
by its own strike squared). The reason why this is the correct weighting is due to the fact the 
vega  profile  doubles  in  height  and  width  if  the  strike  is  doubled.  The  portfolio  has  to  be 
divided by strike K once, to correct for the increase in height, and again to compensate for 
the increase in width (for a combined weight of 1/K2). A more mathematical proof of why 
the  hedge  for  a  variance  swap  is  a  portfolio  of  options  weighted  1/K2  (a  so-called  log 
contract) is given in the section A4 Proof Variance Swaps Should Be Hedged by a Log Contract (= 
1/K2) in the Appendix.  

As a gamma swap payout is identical to a variance swap multiplied by spot, the weighting is 
1/K (multiplying by spot cancels one of the K’s on the denominator). The vega profile of a 
portfolio weighted 1/K and 1/K2 is shown below, along with an equal-weighted portfolio 
for comparison. We note that although the vega profile of a variance swap is a flat line, the 
value is not constant and it moves with volatility (variance swap vega = variance notional × 
2σ).  The  vega  profile  of  a  volatility  swap  is  of  course  a  flat  line  (as  vega  is  equal  to  the 
volatility notional).

Var swaps are long skew and volatility surface curvature 

The 1/K2 weighting means a larger amount of OTM puts are traded than OTM calls (c60% 
is made up of puts). This causes a log contract (portfolio of options weighted 1/K2) to be 
long skew. This weighting means the wings (very out-of-the-money options) have a greater 
weighting than the body (near ATM options), which means a log contract is long volatility 
surface curvature6.

VOL SWAPS CAN BE HEDGED WITH VAR SWAPS 

Unlike  variance  swaps  (or  gamma  swaps),  volatility  swaps  cannot  be  hedged  by  a  static 
portfolio of options. Volatility swaps can be hedged with variance swaps as, for small moves, 
the  payout  can  be  similar  (see  Figure  36  below).  The  vega  of  a  variance  swap  is  equal  to 
variance  notional×2σ.  For  example,  for  σ=25 the  vega is  2×25  =  50  times the size  of the 
variance swap notional. So, a volatility swap of vega ‘V’ can be hedged with V/2σ variance 
notional of a variance swap. As a variance swap is normally quoted in vega, the vega / 2σ 
formula is used to calculate the variance notional of the trade. 

6 The inclusion of OTM (and hence convex) options mean the log contract is also long volga (or vega 
convexity), but they are not the same thing. Long OTM (wing) options is long vega convexity, but not 
volatility  surface  curvature  (unless  they  are  shorting  the  ATM  or  body  at  the  same  time).  The 
curvature of the volatility surface can be defined as the difference between 90-100 skew and 100-110 
skew (ie, the value of 90% + 110% – 2×100% implied volatilities).

VOLATILITY SWAPS ARE SHORT VOL OF VOL 

Figure 36 above shows that the payout of a variance swap is always in excess of the payout 
of a volatility swap of the same vega. This is why the fair level of a variance swap is usually 
one  or  two  volatility  points  above  volatility  swaps.  The  negative  convexity  of  the  payout 
(compared to a variance swap) shows that volatility swaps are short vol of vol. 

A volatility swap being short vol of vol can also be shown by the fact the identical vega of a 
variance swap has to be weighted 1/(2σ). If a trader is long a volatility swap and has hedged 
with  a  short  variance  swap  position  weighted  1/(2σ),  then  as  volatility  decreases  more 
variance swaps have to be sold (as σ decreases, 1/(2σ) rises). Conversely, as volatility rises, 
variance  swaps  have  to  be  bought  (to  decrease  the  short).  Having  to  sell  when  volatility 
declines and buy when it rises shows that volatility swaps are short vol of vol. 

Variance notional = Vega / (2σ) 

VAR SWAP VEGA NOT CONSTANT IF VOLATILITY CHANGES 

We note that although the vega profile of a variance swap against spot is a flat line, this value 
is not constant and it moves with volatility (variance swap vega = variance notional × 2σ). 
The  vega  profile  of  a  volatility  swap  against  volatility  is,  of  course,  a  constant  flat  line  (as 
vega  is  equal  to  the  volatility  notional).  Therefore,  variance  swaps  have  constant  vega  for 
changes in spot (but not changes in volatility), while volatility swaps have constant vega for 
changes in volatility and spot.

VAR AND VOL DIFFERENCE CAN BE APPROXIMATED 

Given  that  the  difference  between  variance  and  volatility  swap  prices  is  due  to  the  fact 
volatility  swaps  are  short  vol  of  vol,  it  is  possible  to  derive  the  formula  below,  which 
approximates the difference between variance swap and volatility swap prices (as long as the 
maturity  and  vol  of  vol  are  not  both  excessive,  which  tends  not  to  happen  as  longer 
maturities  have  less  vol  of  vol).  Using  the  formula,  the  price  of  a  volatility  swap  can  be 
approximated  by  the  price  of  a  variance  swap  less  the  convexity  adjustment  c.  Using  this 
formula, the difference between variance and volatility swaps is graphed in Figure 38 below.

Model risk of vol of vol is small vs tail risk of variance swap 

Hedging vol of vol raises trading costs and introduces model risk. Since the credit crunch, 
however, single-stock variance no longer trades and dispersion is now quoted using volatility 
swaps instead. Investment banks are happier taking the small model risk of vol of vol rather 
than being short the tail risk of a variance swap. As can be seen in Figure 39 below, variance 
swaps  trade  one  or  two  volatility  points  above  volatility  swaps  (for  the  most  popular 
maturities). A simpler rule of thumb is that volatility swaps trade roughly in line with ATMf 
implied volatilities.

GREEKS OF VOL, VAR AND GAMMA SWAPS 

As a volatility swap needs a vol of vol model, the Greeks are dependent on the model used. 
For  variance  swaps  and  gamma  swaps,  there  is  no  debate  as  to  the  Greeks.  However, 
practical considerations can introduce ‘shadow Greeks’. In theory, a variance swap has zero 
delta, but in practice it has a small ‘shadow delta’ due to the correlation between spot and 
implied  volatility  (skew).  Similarly,  theta  is  not  necessarily  as  constant  as  it  should  be  in 
theory, as movements of the volatility surface can cause it to change. 

Variance swap vega decays linearly with time 

As variance is additive, the vega decays linearly with time. For example, 100K vega of a one 
year variance swap at inception will have 75K vega after three months, 50K after six months 
and 25K after nine months. 

Variance swaps offer constant cash gamma, gamma swaps have constant 
share gamma 

Share gamma is the number of shares that need to be bought (or sold) for a given change in 
spot (typically 1%). It is proportional to the Black-Scholes gamma (second derivative of price 
with respect to spot) multiplied by spot. Cash gamma (or dollar gamma) is the cash amount 
that needs to be bought or sold for a given movement in spot; hence, it is proportional to 
share gamma multiplied by spot (ie, proportional to Black-Scholes gamma multiplied by spot 
squared). Variance swaps offer a constant cash gamma (constant convexity), whereas gamma 
swaps offer constant share gamma (hence the name gamma swaps). 

γ 

= gamma     = number of shares bought (or sold) per €1 spot move  

γ × S 

       = number of shares bought (or sold) per 100% spot (S×€1) move 

γ × S / 100   = share gamma = number of shares bought (or sold) per 1% move  

γ × S2 / 100   = cash/dollar gamma = notional cash value traded per 1% move

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

2.4: OPTIONS ON VARIANCE 

As  the  liquidity  of  the  variance  swap  market  improved  in  the  middle  of  the  last 
decade, market participants started to trade options on variance. As volatility is more 
volatile at high levels, the skew is positive (the inverse of the negative skew seen in 
the equity market). In addition, volatility term structure is inverted, as volatility mean 
reverts and does not stay elevated for long periods of time. 

OPTIONS ON VAR EXPIRY = EXPIRY OF VAR SWAP 

An  option  on  variance  is  a  European  option  (like  all  exotics)  on  a  variance  swap  whose 
expiry is the same expiry as the option. As it is an option on variance, a volatility of volatility 
model is needed in order to price the option. At inception, the underlying is 100% implied 
variance, whereas at maturity the underlying is 100% realised variance (and in between it will 
be  a  blend  of  the  two).  As the  daily  variance  of  the  underlying  is  locked  in  every day,  the 
payoff could be considered to be similar to an Asian (averaging) option. 

Options on variance are quoted in volatility points 

Like a variance swap, the price of an option on variance is quoted in volatility points. The 
typical 3-month to 18-month maturity of the option is in line with the length of time it takes 
3-month  realised  volatility  to  mean  revert  after  a  crisis.  The  poor  liquidity  of  options  on 
variance, and the fact the underlying tends towards a cash basket over time, means a trade is 
usually held until expiry.

PUT CALL PARITY APPLIES TO OPTIONS ON VARIANCE 

As variance swaps have a convex volatility payout, so do options on variance. As options on 
variance are European, put call parity applies. The fact a long call on variance and short put 
on variance (of the same strike) is equal to a forward on variance (or variance swap) gives the 
following  result  for  options  on  variance  whose  strike  is  not  the  current  level  of  variance 
swaps.

where: 

Premiumvariance points = 2σS × Premiumvolatility points where σS = var swap reference 

PREMIUM PAID FOR OPTION = VEGA × PREMIUM IN VOL PTS 

The  premium  paid  for  the  option  can  either  be  expressed  in  terms  of  vega,  or  variance 
notional. Both are shown below:

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

BREAKEVENS ARE NON-TRIVIAL DUE TO CONVEXITY 

The convexity of a variance swap means that a put on a variance swap has a lower payout 
than  a  put  on  volatility  and  a  call  on  variance  swap  has  a  higher  payout  than  a  call  on 
volatility  (see  Figure  41  below).  Similarly,  it  also  means  the  maximum  payout  of  a  put  on 
variance  is  significantly  less  than  the  strike.  This  convexity  also  means  the  breakevens  for 
option on variance are slightly different from the breakevens for option on volatility (strike – 
premium for puts, strike + premium for calls).

OPTIONS ON VARIANCE HAVE POSITIVE SKEW 

Volatility  (and  hence  variance)  is  relatively  stable  when  it  is  low,  as  calm  markets  tend  to 
have  low  and  stable  volatility.  Conversely,  volatility  is  more  unstable  when  it  is  high  (as 
turbulent markets could get worse with higher volatility, or recover with lower volatility). For 
this reason, options on variance have positive skew, with high strikes having higher implied 
volatility than low strikes. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.4: Options on Variance 

71 

Implied variance term structure is inverted, but not as inverted as realised 
variance 

As historical volatility tends to mean revert in an eight-month time horizon (on average), the 
term structure of options on variance is inverted (while volatility can spike and be high for 
short periods of time, over the long term it trades in a far narrower range). We note that, as 
the highest volatility occurs due to unexpected events, the peak of implied volatility (which is 
based on the market’s expected future volatility) is lower than the peak of realised volatility. 
Hence,  the  volatility  of  implied  variance  is  lower  than  the  volatility  of  realised  variance, 
especially for short maturities.

CAPPED VAR HAVE EMBEDDED OPTION ON VAR 

While options on variance swaps are not particularly liquid, their pricing is key for valuing 
variance  swaps  with  a  cap.  Capped  variance  swaps  are  standard  for  single  stocks  and 
emerging  market  indices  and  can  be  traded  on  regular  indices  as  well.  When  the  variance 
swap market initially became more liquid, some participants did not properly model the cap, 
as  it  was  seen  to  have  little  value.  The  advent  of  the  credit  crunch  and  resulting  rise  in 
volatility made the caps more valuable, and now market participants fail to model them at 
their peril. 

Variance Swap with Cap C = Variance Swap - Option on Variance with Cap C 

Option on Variance with Cap C = Variance Swap - Variance Swap with Cap C 

While value of cap is small at inception, it can become more valuable as 
market moves 

A  capped  variance  swap  can  be  modelled  as  a  vanilla  variance  swap  less  an  option  on 
variance, whose strike is the cap. This is true as the value of an option on variance at the cap 
will be equal to the difference between the capped and uncapped variance swaps. Typically, 
the cap is at 2.5× the strike and, hence, is not particularly valuable at inception. However, as 
the market moves, the cap can become closer to the money and more valuable.

CHAPTER 2: VOLATILITY TRADING 

OPTIONS ON VAR STRATEGIES SIMILAR TO OPTIONS 

Strategies that are useful for vanilla options have a read-across for options on variance. For 
example, a long variance position can be protected or overwritten. The increased liquidity of 
VIX options allows relative value trades to be put on. 

Selling straddles on options on variance can also be a popular strategy, as volatility can be 
seen to have a floor above zero. Hence, strikes can be chosen so that the lower breakeven is 
in line with the perceived floor to volatility. 

Options on variance can also be used to hedge a volatility swap position, as an option on 
variance can offset the vol of vol risk embedded in a volatility swap. 

OPTIONS ON VOL FUTURES ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT  

While  options  on  volatility  futures  have  many  similarities  to  options  on  variance,  they  are 
slightly different. For more details see the section 4.5: Options On Volatility Futures.

WHY EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU 
KNOW ABOUT VOLATILITY IS WRONG 

Assuming implied volatility is an unbiased estimate of future realised volatility is an 
easy mistake to make, however the fair price of implied volatility is above the expected 
future realised volatility. In addition, the impact of hedging both structured products 
and  variable  annuity  products  can  cause  imbalances  in  the  volatility  market.  These 
distortions  can  create  opportunities  for  investors  willing  to  take  the  other  side.  We 
examine  the  opportunities  from  these  imbalances  and  dispel  the  myth  of  using 
volatility as an equity hedge. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
74   CHAPTER 3: WHY EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT VOL IS WRONG 

3.1: IMPLIED VOLATILITY SHOULD BE ABOVE 

REALIZED VOLATILITY 

Selling  implied  volatility  is  one  of  the  most  popular  trading  strategies  in  equity 
derivatives.  Empirical  analysis  shows  that  implied  volatility  or  variance  is,  on 
average, overpriced. However, as volatility is negatively correlated to equity returns, a 
short volatility (or variance) position is implicitly long equity risk. As equity returns 
are expected to return an equity risk premium over the risk-free rate (which is used 
for  derivative  pricing),  this  implies  short  volatility  should  also  be  abnormally 
profitable.  Therefore,  part  of  the  profits  from  short  volatility  strategies  can  be 
attributed to the fact equities are expected to deliver returns above the risk-free rate. 

SHORT VOL HAS SIMILAR RISK & RETURN TO LONG EQUITY 

As  implied  volatility  tends  to  trade  at  a  higher  level  than  realised  volatility,  a  common 
perception  is  that  implied  volatility  is  overpriced.  While  there  are  supply  and  demand 
imbalances  that  can  cause  volatility  to  be  overpriced,  part  of  the  overpricing  is  due  to  the 
correlation  between  volatility  and  equity  returns.  A  short  volatility  position  is  positively 
correlated  to  the  equity  market  (as  volatility  typically  increases  when  equities  decline).  As 
equities’  average  return  is  greater  than  the  risk-free  rate,  this  means  that  the  risk-neutral 
implied volatility should be expected to be above the true realised volatility. Even taking this 
into  account,  volatility  appears  to  be  overpriced.  We  believe  that  implied  volatility  is 
overpriced on average due to the demand for hedges.

3.1: Implied Volatility Should Be Above Realized Volatility 

75 

Far-dated options are most overpriced, due to upward sloping term structure 

Volatility  selling  strategies  typically  involve  selling  near-dated  volatility  (or  variance). 
Examples include call overwriting or selling near-dated variance (until the recent explosion 
of volatility, this was a popular hedge fund strategy that many structured products copied). 
As term structure is on average upward sloping, this implies that far-dated implieds are more 
expensive  than  near  dated  implieds.  The  demand  for  long-dated  protection  (eg,  from 
variable annuity providers) offers a fundamental explanation for term structure being upward 
sloping (see section 3.3 Variable Annuity Hedging Lifts Long-Term Vol). However, as 12× one 
month options (or variance swaps) can be sold in the same period of time as 1× one-year 
option (or variance swap), greater profits can be earned from selling the near-dated product 
despite it being less overpriced. We note the risk is greater if several near-dated options (or 
variance swap) are sold in any period. 

VOLATILITY OVERPRICING IS UNLIKELY TO DISAPPEAR 

There are several fundamental reasons why volatility, and variance, is overpriced. Since these 
reasons are structural, we believe that implied volatility is likely to remain overpriced for the 
foreseeable future.  Given  variance  exposure  to overpriced  wings  (and  low strike  puts)  and 
the risk aversion to variance post credit crunch, we view variance as more overpriced than 
volatility. 

  Demand for put protection. The demand for hedging products, either from investors, 
structured  products  or  providers  of  variable  annuity  products,  needs  to  be  offset  by 
market makers. As market makers are usually net sellers of volatility, they charge margin 
for taking this risk and for the costs of gamma hedging. 

  Demand for OTM options lifts wings. Investors typically like buying OTM options as 
there  is  an  attractive  risk-reward  profile  (similar  to  buying  a  lottery  ticket).  Market 
makers therefore raise their prices to compensate for the asymmetric risk they face. As 
the  price  of  variance  swaps  is  based  on  options  of  all  strikes,  this  lifts  the  price  of 
variance. 

  Index  implieds  lifted  from  structured  product  demand.  The  demand  from 
structured products typically lifts index implied compared to single-stock implied. This is 
why implied correlation is higher than it should be. 

 
76  CHAPTER 3: WHY EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT VOL IS WRONG 

SELLING VOL SHOULD BE LESS PROFITABLE THAN BEFORE 

Hedge  funds  typically  aim  to  identify  mispricings  in  order  to  deliver  superior  returns. 
However,  as  both  hedge  funds  and  the  total  hedge  fund  marketplace  grow  larger,  their 
opportunities  are  gradually  being  eroded.  We  believe  that  above-average  returns  are  only 
possible in the following circumstances: 

  A  fund  has  a  unique  edge  (eg,  through  analytics,  trading  algorithms  or  proprietary 

information/analysis). 

  There are relatively few funds in competition,  or it is not possible for a significant 
number of competitors to participate in an opportunity (either due to funding or legal 
restrictions, lack of liquid derivatives markets or excessive risk/time horizon of trade). 

  There  is  a  source  of  imbalance  in  the  markets  (eg,  structured  product  flow  or 

regulatory demand for hedging), causing a mispricing of risk. 

All  of  the  above  reasons  have  previously  held  for  volatility  selling  strategies  (eg,  call 
overwriting or selling of one/three-month variance swaps). However, given the abundance 
of  publications  on  the  topic  in  the  past  few  years  and  the  launch  of  several  structured 
products that attempt to profit from this opportunity, we believe that volatility selling could 
be less profitable than before. The fact there remains an imbalance in the market due to the 
demand  for  hedging  should  mean  volatility  selling  is,  on  average,  a  profitable  strategy. 
However,  we  would  caution  against  using  a back test based on historical data as  a reliable 
estimate of future profitability.

3.2: LONG VOLATILITY IS A POOR HEDGE 

An ideal hedging instrument for a security is an instrument with -100% correlation to 
that security and zero cost. As the return on variance swaps have a c-70% correlation 
with equity markets, adding long volatility positions (either through variance swaps 
or futures on volatility indices such as VIX or vStoxx) to an equity position could be 
thought of as a useful hedge. However, as volatility is on average overpriced, the cost 
of this strategy far outweighs any diversification benefit. 

VOLATILITY HAS UP TO 70% CORRELATION WITH EQUITY 

Equity markets tend to become more volatile when they decline and less volatile when they 
rise. A fundamental reason for this is the fact that gearing increases as equities decline7. As 
both  gearing  and  volatility  are  measures of risk,  they should  be  correlated; hence,  they  are 
negatively correlated to equity returns. While short term measures of volatility (eg, vStoxx) 
only have an R2 of 50%-60% against the equity market, longer dated variance swaps (purest 
way to trade volatility) can have up to c70% R2. 

1 YEAR VOLATILITY HAS HIGHEST CORRELATION TO EQUITY 

There are two competing factors to the optimum maturity for a volatility hedge. The longer 
the maturity, the more likely the prolonged period of volatility will be due to a decline in the 
market. This should give longer maturities higher equity volatility correlation, as the impact 
of  short-term  noise  is  reduced.  However,  for  long  maturities  (years),  there  is  a  significant 
chance  that  the  equity  market  will  recover  from  any  downturn,  reducing  equity  volatility 
correlation. The optimum correlation between the SX5E and variance swaps, is for returns 
between  nine  months  and  one  year.  This  is  roughly  in  line  with  the  c8  months  it  takes 
realised volatility to mean revert after a crisis. 

SHORT-DATED VOLATILITY FUTURES ARE A POOR HEDGE 

Recently,  there  have  been several  products  based  on rolling  VIX  or  vStoxx  futures  whose 
average  maturity  is  kept  constant.  As  these  products  have  to  continually  buy  far-dated 
futures and sell near-dated futures (to keep average maturity constant as time passes), returns 
suffer from upward sloping term structure. Since the launch of vStoxx futures, rolling one-
month vStoxx futures have had negative returns (see Figure 51 below). This is despite the 
SX5E  also  having  suffered  a  negative  return,  suggesting  that  rolling  vStoxx  futures  are  a 
poor  hedge.  For  more  details  on  futures  on  volatility  indices,  see  the  section  4.1  Forward 
Starting Products.

LONG VOLATILITY HAS NEGATIVE RETURNS ON AVERAGE 

Long volatility strategies, on average, have negative returns. This overpricing can be broken 
down into two components: 

  Correlation  with  equity  market.  As  equity  markets  are  expected  to  return  an  equity 
risk premium over the risk-free rate, strategies that are implicitly long equity risk should 
similarly  outperform  (and  strategies  that  are  implicitly  short  equity  risk  should 
underperform).  As  a  long  volatility  strategy  is  implicitly  short  equity  risk,  it  should 
underperform.  We  note  this  drawback  should  affect  all  hedging  instruments,  as  a 
hedging instrument by definition has to be short the risk to be hedged. 

  Overpricing  of  volatility.  Excessive  demand  for  volatility  products  has  historically 
caused  implied  volatility  to  be  overpriced.  As  this  demand  is  not  expected  to 
significantly  decrease,  it  is  likely  that  implied  volatility  will  continue  to  be  overpriced 
(although volatility will probably not be as overpriced as in the past). 

 
 
 
3.2: Long Volatility Is a Poor Hedge 

79 

VOLATILITY IS A POOR HEDGE COMPARED TO FUTURES 

While all hedging instruments can be expected to have a cost (due to being implicitly short 
equities and assuming a positive equity risk premium), long variance swaps have historically 
had an additional cost due to the overpricing of volatility. This additional cost makes long 
variance  swaps  an  unattractive  hedge  compared  to  reducing  the  position  (or  shorting 
futures). This is shown in Figure 45 below by adding an additional variance swap position to 
a  100%  investment  in  equities  (we  optimistically  assume  zero  margining  and  other  trading 
costs to the variance swap position).

Vol as a hedge suffers from overpricing, and less than 100% correlation 

While the risk of the long equity and long variance swap position initially decreases as the 
long variance position increases in size, the returns of the portfolio are less than the returns 
for a reduced equity position of the same risk (we assume the proceeds from the equity sale 
are  invested  in  the  risk-free  rate,  which  should  give  similar  returns  to  hedging  via  short 
futures). Unlike hedging with futures, there comes a point at which increasing variance swap 
exposure  does  not  reduce  risk  (and,  in  fact,  increases  it)  due  to  the  less  than  100% 
correlation with the equity market. 

 
 
 
80  CHAPTER 3: WHY EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT VOL IS WRONG 

Equities need to have positive return over hedging back-testing period 

While we acknowledge that there are periods of time in which a long volatility position is a 
profitable hedge, these tend to occur when equity returns are negative (and short futures are 
usually a better hedge). We believe that the best back-testing periods for comparing hedging 
strategies are those in which equities have a return above the risk-free rate (if returns below 
the  risk-free  rate  are  expected,  then  investors  should  switch  allocation  away  from  equities 
into  risk-free  debt).  For  these  back-testing  periods,  long  volatility  strategies  struggle  to 
demonstrate value as a useful hedging instrument. Hence, we see little reason for investors 
to hedge with variance swaps rather than futures given the overpricing of volatility, and less 
than 100% correlation between volatility and equity returns. 

HEDGING WITH VARIANCE IS NOT COMPABLE TO PUTS 

Due to the lack of convexity of a variance swap hedge, we believe it is best to compare long 
variance  hedges  to  hedging  with  futures  rather  than  hedging  with  puts.  Although  variance 
hedges might be cheaper than put hedges, the lack of convexity for long volatility makes this 
an unfair comparison, in our view. 

 
 
3.3: Variable Annuity Hedging Lifts Long-Term Vol 

81 

3.3: VARIABLE ANNUITY HEDGING LIFTS LONG-

TERM VOL 

Since  the  1980s,  a  significant  amount  of  variable  annuity  products  have  been  sold, 
particularly in the USA. The size of this market is now over US$1trn. From the mid-
1990s, these products started to become more complicated and offered guarantees to 
the purchaser (similar to being long a put). The hedging of these products increases 
the demand for long-dated downside strikes, which lifts long-dated implied volatility 
and skew. 

VARIABLE ANNUITIES OFTEN EMBED A ‘PUT’ OPTION 

With a fixed annuity, the insurance company that sold the product invests the proceeds and 
guarantees  the  purchaser  a  guaranteed  fixed  return.  Variable  annuities,  however,  allow  the 
purchaser to pick which investments they want to put their funds into. The downside to this 
flexibility is the unprotected exposure to a decline in the market. To make variable annuities 
more attractive, from the 1990s many were sold with some forms of downside protection (or 
put). The different types of protection are detailed below in order of the risk to the insurance 
company. 

  Return of premium. This product effectively buys an ATM put in addition to investing 

proceeds. The investor is guaranteed returns will not be negative. 

  Roll-up.  Similar  to  return  of  premium;  however,  the  minimum  guaranteed  return  is 
greater than 0%. The hedging of this product buys a put which is ITM with reference to 
spot, but OTM compared with the forward. 

  Ratchet (or maximum anniversary value). These products return the highest value the 
underlying has ever traded at (on certain dates). The hedging of these products involves 
payout look-back options, more details of which are in the section 5.4 Look-Back Options. 

  Greater  of  ‘ratchet’  or  ‘roll-up’.  This  product  returns  the  greater  of  the  ‘roll-up’  or 

‘ratchet’ protection. 

Hedging of variable annuity products lifts index term structure and skew 

The  hedging  of  variable  annuity  involves  the  purchase  of  downside  protection  for  long 
maturities. Often the products are 20+ years long, but as the maximum maturity with sufficient 
liquidity available on indices can only be 3-5 years, the position has to be dynamically hedged 
with  the  shorter-dated  option.  This  constant  bid  for  long-dated  protection  lifts  index  term 
structure and skew, particularly for the S&P500 but also affects other major indices (potentially 
due  to  relative  value  trading).  The  demand  for  protection  (from  viable  annuity  providers  or 
other investors), particularly on the downside and for longer maturities, could be considered to 
be  the  reason  why  volatility  (of  all  strikes  and  maturities),  skew  (for  all  maturities)  and  term 
structure are usually overpriced. 

82  CHAPTER 3: WHY EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT VOL IS WRONG 

CREDIT CRUNCH HAS HIT VARIABLE ANNUITY PROVIDERS 

Until the TMT bubble burst, guarantees embedded in variable annuity products were often 
seen as unnecessary ‘bells and whistles’. The severe declines between 2000 and 2003 made 
guarantees in variable annuity products more popular. When modelling dynamic strategies, 
insurance  companies  need  to  estimate  what  implied  volatility  will  be  in  the  future  (eg,  if 
hedging  short  20-year  options  with  5-year  options).  The  implied  volatility  chosen  will  be 
based  on  a  confidence  interval,  say  95%,  to  give  only  a  1-in-20  chance  that  implieds  are 
higher than the level embedded in the security. As the credit crunch caused realised volatility 
to  reach  levels  that  by  some  measures  were  higher  than  in  the  Great  Depression,  implied 
volatility rose to unprecedented heights. This increase in the cost of hedging has weighed on 
margins. 

NO PROP DESK + MOVE TO EXCHANGE = HEDGE COST RISE 

The passing of the Dodd-Frank Act in mid-2010 was designed to improve the transparency 
of derivatives by moving them onto an exchange. However, this would increase the margin 
requirements of long-dated options, which were previously traded OTC. This made it more 
expensive to be the counterparty to variable annuity providers. As the act also included the 
‘Volker Rule’, which prohibits proprietary trading, the number of counterparties shrank (as 
prop  desks  with  attractive  funding  levels  were  a  common  counterparty  for  the  long-dated 
protection  required  by  variable  annuity  hedgers).  The  combination  of  the  spinoff  of  prop 
desks, and movement of OTC options onto an exchange caused skew to rise in mid-2010, 
particularly at the far-dated end of volatility surfaces.

3.4: STRUCTURED PRODUCTS VICIOUS CIRCLE 

The sale of structured products leaves investment banks with a short skew position 
(eg,  short  an  OTM  put  in  order  to  provide  capital-protected  products).  Whenever 
there  is  a  large  decline  in  equities,  this  short  skew  position  causes  the  investment 
bank to be short volatility (eg, as the short OTM put becomes more ATM, the vega 
increases). The covering of this short vega position lifts implied volatility further than 
would be expected. As investment banks are also short vega convexity, this increase 
in  volatility  causes  the  short  vega  position  to  increase  in  size.  This  can  lead  to  a 
‘structured  products  vicious  circle’  as  the  covering  of  short  vega  causes  the  size  of 
the short position to increase. Similarly, if equity markets rise and implied volatility 
falls,  investment  banks  become  long  implied  volatility  and  have  to  sell.  Structured 
products can therefore cause implied volatility to undershoot in a recovery, as well as 
overshoot in a crisis. 

IMPLIED VOL OVER AND UNDERSHOOTS BIG VOL MOVES 

The sale of structured products causes investment banks to have a short skew and short vega 
convexity position8. Whenever there is a significant decline in equities and a spike in implied 
volatility,  or  a  recovery  in  equities  and  a  collapse  in  implied  volatility,  the  position  of 
structured product sellers can exaggerate the movement in implied volatility. This can cause 
implied volatility to overshoot (in a crisis) or undershoot (in a recovery post-crisis). There are 
four parts to the ‘structured products vicious circle’ effect on implied volatilities, which are 
shown in Figure 47 below.

84  CHAPTER 3: WHY EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT VOL IS WRONG 

(1)  EQUITY MARKET DECLINES 

While implied volatility moves – in both directions – are exaggerated, for this example we 
shall  assume  that  there  is  a  decline  in  the  markets  and  a  rise  in  implied  volatility.  If  this 
decline occurs within a short period of time, trading desks have less time to hedge positions, 
and imbalances in the market become more significant. 

(2)  DESKS BECOME SHORT IMPLIED VOLATILITY (DUE TO SHORT SKEW) 

Investment banks are typically short skew from the sale of structured products. This position 
causes  trading  desks  to  become  short  implied  volatility  following  declines  in  the  equity 
market. To demonstrate how this occurs, we shall examine a short skew position through a 
vega flat risk reversal (short 90% put, long 110% call)9.

Short skew + equity markets decline = short vega (ie, short implied vol) 

If  there  is  a  10%  decline  in  equity  markets,  the  90%  put  becomes  ATM  and  increases  in 
vega. As the risk reversal is short the 90% put, the position becomes short vega (or short 
implied  volatility).  In  addition,  the  110%  call  option  becomes  more  OTM  and  further 
decreases  the  vega  of  the  position  (increasing  the  value  of  the  short  implied  volatility 
position).

Even if skew was flat, markets declines cause short skew position to become

The above example demonstrates that it is the fact options become more or less ATM that 
causes the change in vega. It is not the fact downside put options have a higher implied than 
upside call options. If skew was flat (or even if puts traded at a lower implied than calls), the 
above argument would still hold. We therefore need a measure of the rate of change of vega 
for a given change in spot, and this measure is called vanna. 

Vanna = dVega/dSpot

Vanna can be thought of as the size of the skew position (in a similar way that vega is the 
size of a volatility position), while skew (eg, 90%-100% skew) measures the value of skew (in 
a  similar  way  that  implied  volatility  measures  the  value  of  a  volatility  position).  For  more 
details on different Greeks, including vanna, see the section A8 Greeks and Their Meaning in 
the Appendix. 

(3)  SHORT COVERING OF SHORT VEGA POSITION LIFTS IMPLIED VOL 

As the size of trading desks’ short vega position increases during equity market declines, this 
position  is  likely  to  be  covered.  As  all  trading  desks  have  similar  positions,  this  buying 
pressure  causes  an  increase  in  implied  volatility.  This  flow  is  in  addition  to  any  buying 
pressure due to an increase in realised volatility and hence can cause an overshoot in implied 
volatility.

(4)  SHORT VEGA POSITION INCREASES DUE TO VEGA CONVEXITY 

Options  have  their  peak  vega  when  they  are  (approximately)  ATM.  As  implied  volatility 
increases, the vega of OTM options increases and converges with the vega of the peak ATM 
option.  Therefore,  as  implied  volatility  increases,  the  vega  of  OTM  options  increases  (see 
Figure  50  above).  The  rate  of  change  of  vega  given  a  change  in  volatility  is  called  volga 
(VOL-GAmma) or vomma, and is known as vega convexity. 

Volga = dVega/dVol 

Vega convexity causes short volatility position to increase 

As  the  vega  of  options  rises  as  volatility  increases,  this  increases  the  size  of  the  short 
volatility position that needs to be hedged. As trading desks’ volatility short position has now 
increased,  they  have  to  buy  volatility  to  cover the  increased  short  position,  which  leads  to 
further gains in implied volatility. This starts a vicious circle of increasing volatility, which we 
call the ‘structured products vicious circle’. 

VEGA CONVEXITY HIGHEST FOR LOW-TO-MEDIUM IMPLIEDS 

As Figure 56 above shows, the slope of vega against volatility is steepest (ie, vega convexity 
is highest) for low-to-medium implied volatilities. This effect of vega convexity is therefore 
more important in volatility regimes of c20% or less; hence, the effect of structured products 
can have a similar effect when markets rise and volatilities decline. In this case, trading desks 
become long vega, due to skew, and have to sell volatility. Vega convexity causes this long 
position to increase as volatility declines, causing further volatility sellings. This is typically 
seen when a market recovers after a volatile decline (eg, in 2003 and 2009, following the end 
of the tech bubble and credit crunch, respectively). 

IMPACT GREATEST FOR FAR-DATED IMPLIEDS 

While this position has the greatest impact at the far end of volatility surfaces, a rise in far-
dated  term  volatility  and  skew  tends  to  be  mirrored  to  a  lesser  extent  for  nearer-dated 
expiries.  If  there  is  a  disconnect  between  near-  and  far-dated  implied  volatilities,  this  can 
cause a significant change in term structure. 

 
 
88  CHAPTER 3: WHY EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT VOL IS WRONG 

STRUCTURED PRODUCT GUARANTEE IS LONG AN OTM PUT 

The capital guarantee of many structured products leaves the seller of the product effectively 
short an OTM put. A short OTM put is short skew and short vega convexity (or volga). This 
is  a  simplification,  as  structured  products  tend  to  buy  visually  cheap  options  (ie,  OTM 
options) and sell visually expensive options (ie, ATM options), leaving the seller with a long 
ATM  and  short  OTM  volatility  position.  As  OTM  options  have  more  volga  (or  vega 
convexity) than ATM options (see the section A8 Greeks and Their Meaning in the Appendix) 
the  seller  is  short  volga.  The  embedded  option  in  structured  products  is  floored,  which 
causes the seller to be short skew (as the position is similar to being short an OTM put). 

 
 
3.5: Stretching Black-Scholes Assumptions 

89 

3.5: STRETCHING BLACK-SCHOLES ASSUMPTIONS 

The Black-Scholes model assumes an investor knows the future volatility of a stock, 
in addition to being able to continuously delta hedge. In order to discover what the 
likely  profit  (or  loss)  will  be  in  reality,  we  stretch  these  assumptions.  If  the  future 
volatility is unknown, the amount of profit (or loss) will vary depending on the path, 
but buying cheap volatility will always show some profit. However, if the position is 
delta-hedged  discretely,  the  purchase  of  cheap  volatility  may  reveal  a  loss.  The 
variance  of  discretely  delta-hedged  profits  can  be  halved  by  hedging  four  times  as 
frequently.  We  also  show  why  traders  should  hedge  with  a  delta  calculated  from 
expected – not implied – volatility, especially when long volatility. 

MODEL ASSUMES KNOWN VOL AND CONTINUOUS HEDGING 

While there are a number of assumptions behind Black-Scholes, the two which are the least 
realistic are: (1) a continuous and known future realised volatility; and (2) an ability to delta 
hedge continuously. There are, therefore, four different scenarios to investigate. We assume 
that options are European. 

  Continuous delta hedging with known volatility. In this scenario, the profit (or loss) 
from volatility trading is fixed. If the known volatility is constant, then the assumptions 
are  identical  to  Black-Scholes.  Interestingly,  the  results  are  the  same  if  volatility  is 
allowed not to be constant (while still being known). 

  Continuous  delta  hedging  with  unknown  volatility.  If  volatility  is  unknown,  then 
typically  traders  hedge  with  the  delta  calculated  using  implied  volatility.  However,  as 
implied volatility is not a perfect predictor of future realised volatility, this causes some 
variation  in  the  profit  (or  loss)  of  the  position.  However,  with  these  assumptions,  if 
realised  volatility  is  above  the  implied  volatility  price  paid,  it  is  impossible  to  suffer  a 
loss. 

  Discrete  delta  hedging  with  known  volatility.  As  markets  are  not  open  24/7, 
continuous delta hedging is arguably an unreasonable assumption. The path dependency 
of discrete delta hedging adds a certain amount of variation in profits (or losses), which 
can  cause  the  purchase  of  cheap  volatility  (implied  less  than  realised)  to  suffer  a  loss. 
The  variance  of  the  payout  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  frequency  of  the  delta 
hedging. For example, the payout from hedging four times a day has a variance that is a 
quarter of the variance that results if the position is hedged only once a day. 

  Discrete delta hedging with unknown volatility. The most realistic assumption is to 
hedge discretely with unknown volatility. In this case, the payout of volatility trading is 
equal  to  the  sum  of  the  variance  due  to  hedging  with  unknown  volatility  plus  the 
variance due to discretely delta hedging. 

90  CHAPTER 3: WHY EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT VOL IS WRONG 

(1)  CONTINUOUS DELTA HEDGING WITH KNOWN VOLATILITY 

In a Black-Scholes world, the volatility of a stock is constant and known. While a trader is 
also able to continuously delta hedge, Figure 51 below will assume we hedge discretely but in 
an infinitesimally small amount of time. In each unit of time, the stock can either go up or 
down. As the position is initially delta-neutral (ie, delta is zero), the gamma (or convexity) of 
the position gives it a profit for both downward and upward movements. While this effect is 
always profitable, the position does lose time value (due to theta). If an option is priced using 
the  actual  fixed  constant  volatility  of  the  stock,  the  two  effects  cancel  each  other  and  the 
position does not earn an abnormal profit or loss as the return is equal to the risk-free rate. 
There is a very strong relationship between gamma and theta (theta pays for gamma)10.

Profit from delta hedging is equal to the difference between price and 
theoretical price 

The  theoretical  price  of  an  option,  using  the  known  volatility,  can  be  extracted  by  delta 
hedging. Should an option be bought at an implied volatility less than realised volatility, the 
difference  between  the  theoretical  price  and  the  actual  price  will  equal  the  profit  of  the 
trade. Figure 52 below shows the profit vs the difference in implied and realised volatility. As 
there is no path dependency, the profit (or loss) of the trade is fixed and cannot vary.

with spot).

As theta and gamma are correlated, profits are not path dependent 

If a position is continuously delta hedged with the correct delta (calculated from the known 
future volatility over the life of the option), then the payout is not path dependent. Figure 53 
below shows two paths with equal volatility and the same start and end point. Even though 
one path is always ATM while the other has most volatility OTM, delta hedging gives the 
same profit for both. This is due to the fact that, while the ATM option earns more due to 
delta hedging, the total theta cost is also higher (and exactly cancels the delta hedging profit).

92  CHAPTER 3: WHY EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT VOL IS WRONG 

Profits are path independent, even if vol is not constant (but still known) 

While Black-Scholes assumes a constant known volatility, there are similar results for non-
constant  known  volatility.  This  result  is  due  to  the  fact  that  a  European  option  payout 
depends only on the stock price at expiry. Therefore, the volatility over the life of the option 
is the only input to pricing. The timing of this volatility is irrelevant. 

(2)  CONTINUOUS DELTA HEDGING WITH UNKNOWN VOLATILITY 

As  it  is  impossible  to  know  in  advance  what  the  future  volatility  of  a  security  will  be,  the 
implied  volatility  is  often used  to  calculate  deltas. Delta  hedging  using  this  estimate  causes 
the position to have equity market risk and, hence, it becomes path dependent (although the 
average or expected profit remains unchanged). Figure 54 below shows that the profits from 
delta hedging are no longer independent of the direction in which the underlying moves. The 
fact  that  there  is  a  difference  between  the  correct  delta  (calculated  using  the  remaining 
volatility to be realised over the life of the option) and the delta calculated using the implied 
volatility means returns are dependent on the direction of equity markets.

If implied volatility = realised volatility, profits are path independent 

If the implied volatility is equal to the realised volatility, then the estimated delta calculated 
from the implied will be equal to the actual delta (calculated from the realised). In this case, 
profits from hedging will exactly match the theta cost for all paths, so it is path independent.

With continuous hedging buying a cheap option is always profitable 

If there is a difference between the actual delta and estimated delta, there is market risk but 
not enough to make a cheap option unprofitable (or an expensive option profitable). This is 
because  in  each  infinitesimally  small  amount  of  time  a  cheap  option  will  always  reveal  a 
profit from delta hedging (net of theta), although the magnitude of this profit is uncertain. 
The greater the difference between implied and realised, the greater the market risk and the 
larger the potential variation in profit. 

(3)  DISCRETE DELTA HEDGING WITH KNOWN VOLATILITY 

While  assuming  continuous  delta  hedging  is  mathematically  convenient,  it  is  impossible  in 
practice.  Issues  such  as  the  cost  of  trading  and  minimum  trading  size  (even  if  this  is  one 
share)  make  continuous  trading  impossible,  as  do  fundamental  reasons,  such  as  trading 
hours (if you cannot trade 24 hours then it is impossible to trade overnight and prices can 
jump between the close of one day and start of another) and weekends. 

Discrete hedging errors can be reduced by increasing the frequency of 
hedging 

The more frequent the discrete hedging, the less variation in the returns. If 24-hour trading 
were possible, then with an infinite frequency of hedging with known volatility the returns 
converge to the same case as continuous hedging with known volatility (ie, Black-Scholes). 

 
 
 
94  CHAPTER 3: WHY EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT VOL IS WRONG 

In order to show how the frequency of hedging can affect the payout of delta hedging, we 
shall examine hedging for every 5% and 10% move in spot.

Hedging every 5% move in spot 

If an investor delta hedges every 5% move in spot, then an identical profit is earned if the 
underlying rises 10% as if the underlying rises 5% and then returns to its starting point. This 
shows  that  the  hedging  frequency  should  ideally  be  frequent  enough  to  capture  the  major 
turning points of an underlying. 

Hedging every 10% move in spot 

If the investor is hedged for every 10% move in the underlying, then no profit will be earned 
if the underlying rises 5% and then returns to its starting point. However, if the underlying 
rises 10%, a far larger profit will be earned than if the position was hedged every 5%. This 
shows  that  in  trending  markets  it  is  more  profitable  to  let  positions  run  than  to  re-hedge 
them frequently. 

Hedging error is independent of average profitability of trade 

As the volatility of the underlying is known, there is no error due to the calculation of delta. 
As the only variation introduced is essentially ‘noise’, the size of this noise, or variation, is 
independent  from  the  average  profitability  (or  difference  between  realised  vol  and  implied 
vol) of the trade.

With discrete hedging, cheap options can lose money 

With continuous delta hedging (with known or unknown volatility) it is impossible to lose 
money  on  a  cheap  option  (an  option  whose  implied  volatility  is  less  than  the  realised 
volatility over its life). However, as the error from discrete hedging is independent from the 
profitability of the trade, it is possible to lose money on a cheap option (and make money on 
an expensive option). 

Hedging error is halved if frequency of hedging increased by factor of four 

The  size  of  the  hedging  error  can  be  reduced  by  increasing  the  frequency  of  hedging.  An 
approximation (shown below) is that if the frequency of hedging is increased by a factor of 
four, the hedging error term halves. This rule of thumb breaks down for very high-frequency 
hedging, as no frequency of hedging can eliminate the noise from non-24x7 trading (it will 
always  have  noise,  due  to  the  movement  in  share  prices  from  one  day’s  close  to  the  next 
day’s open).

(4)  DISCRETE DELTA HEDGING WITH UNKNOWN VOLATILITY 

The most realistic assumption for profitability comes from the combination of discrete delta 
hedging  and  unknown  volatility.  Trading  hours  and  trading  costs  are  likely  to  limit  the 
frequency at which a trader can delta hedge. Equally, the volatility of a stock is unknown, so 
implied volatility is likely to be used to calculate the delta. The variation in the profit (or loss) 
is caused by the variation due to discrete hedging and the inaccuracy of the delta (as volatility 
is unknown). Figure 58 below shows this combined variation in profit (or loss) and, as for 
discrete  hedging  with  known  volatility,  it  is  possible  for  a  delta  hedged  cheap  option  to 
reveal a loss.

CAN YOU LOSE MONEY BUYING AN OPTION 20 PTS CHEAP? 

As  an  example,  let  us  assume  a  Dec08  SX5E  ATM  straddle  was  purchased  in  April  2008 
when the implied volatility was a low 22%. This position was delta hedged at the close using 
the  delta  calculated  from  the  implied  volatility  of  the  option (using  implied  volatility  as  an 
estimate  of  future  volatility  is  standard  market  practice  for  calculating  Greeks).  In  theory, 
this strategy would have been very profitable as the future realised volatility between April 
2008 and Dec08 expiry was 42% (20 points higher, and almost double, the implied volatility 
paid for the straddle). As markets did not anticipate the fact that the future realised volatility 
would  (by  some  measures) rise  to  a  greater  level  than  in  the  great  depression,  the  implied 
volatility  of  the  option  was  significantly  different  from  the  actual  future  realised  volatility. 
Using implied volatility as an incorrect future volatility assumption to calculate the delta led 
to a significant loss to what should have been a highly profitable strategy. 

 
 
 
3.5: Stretching Black-Scholes Assumptions 

97 

Why delta hedging an option 20pts cheap can still cause a loss 

Delta hedging a long Dec08 ATM straddle at 22% implied when the future realised volatility 
is  42%  should  have  been  a  very  profitable  strategy.  However,  most  of  the  volatility  came 
after the Lehman bankruptcy, which occurred towards the end of the option’s life. As equity 
markets had declined since April 2008, the strike of the straddle would be significantly above 
spot when Lehman went bankrupt. If implied volatility was used to calculate the delta, then 
the time value would be assumed to be near zero. The delta of the straddle would therefore 
be ≈ -100% (the call would be OTM with a delta ≈ 0, while the put would be ITM with a 
delta ≈ 100%).   

To be delta-hedged, the investor would then buy 100% of the underlying per straddle. If the 
delta was calculated using the actual volatility (which was much higher), then the time value 
would be higher and the delta greater than -100% (eg, -80%). As the delta-hedged investor 
would  have  bought  20%  less  of  the  underlying  per  straddle,  when  the  market  fell  after 
Lehman collapsed this position outperformed hedging with implied volatility. 

Investors should use expected vol, not implied vol, to calculate Greeks 

These  results  can  be  seen  in  Figure  59  below,  which  gives  a  clear  example  of  why  traders 
should hedge with the delta calculated from expected volatility rather than implied volatility. 
Because of the extreme volatility at the end of 2008, the two deltas differed at times by 24% 
(60% vs 84%).

98  CHAPTER 3: WHY EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT VOL IS WRONG 

Hedging with delta using implied volatility is bad for long vol strategies 

Typically,  when  volatility  rises  there  is  often  a  decline  in  the  markets.  The  strikes  of  the 
option  are  therefore  likely  to  be  above  spot  when  actual  volatility  is  above  implied.  This 
reduces the profits of the delta-hedged position as the position is actually long delta when it 
appears  to  be  delta  flat.  Alternatively,  the  fact  that  the  position  hedged  with  the  realised 
volatility over the life of the option is profitable can be thought of as due to the fact it is 
properly  gamma  hedged,  as  it  has  more  time  value  than  is  being  priced  into  the  market. 
Hence,  if  a  trader  buys  an  option  when  the  implied  looks  5pts  too  cheap,  then  the  delta 
should be calculated from a volatility 5pts above current implied volatility. Using the proper 
volatility assumption to calculate the delta means the profit from delta hedging an option is 
approximately  the  difference  between  the  theoretical  value  of  the  option  at  inception  (ie, 
using actual future realised volatility in pricing) and the price of the option (ie, using implied 
volatility in pricing). 

While this analysis has concentrated on delta, a similar logic applies for the calculation of all 
Greeks.

FORWARD STARTING PRODUCTS AND 
VOLATILITY INDICES 

Forward starting options are a popular method of trading forward volatility and term 
structure  as there is no exposure to near-term volatility and, hence, zero theta (until 
the  start  of  the  forward  starting  option).  Recently,  trading  forward  volatility  via 
volatility futures such as VIX and vStoxx futures has become increasingly popular. 
However, as is the case with forward starting options, there are modelling issues.

CHAPTER 4: FORWARD STARTING PRODUCTS AND VOLATILITY INDICES 

4.1: FORWARD STARTING PRODUCTS 

Forward starting options are a popular method of trading forward volatility and term 
structure as there is no exposure to near-term volatility and, hence, zero theta (until 
the start of the forward starting option. As the exposure is to forward volatility rather 
than  volatility,  more  sophisticated  models  need  to  be  used  to  price  them  than 
ordinary options. Forward starting options will usually have wider bid-offer spreads 
than vanilla options, as their pricing and hedging is more complex. Recently, trading 
forward  volatility  via  VIX  and  vStoxx  futures  has  become  increasingly  popular, 
however  there  are  modelling  issues.  Forward  starting  variance  swaps  are  easier  to 
price as the price is determined by two variance swaps. 

ZERO THETA IS ADVANTAGE OF FWD STARTING PRODUCTS 

The  main  attraction  of  forward  starting  products  is  that  they  provide  investors  with  long-
term  volatility  (or  vega)  exposure,  without  having  exposure  to  short-term  volatility  (or 
gamma)11.  As  there  is  zero  gamma  until  the  forward  (fwd)  starting  product  starts,  the 
product does not have to pay any theta. Forward starting products are most appropriate for 
investors  who  believe  that  there  is  going  to  be  volatility  in  the  future  (eg,  during  a  key 
economic announcement or a reporting date) but that realised volatility is likely to be low in 
the near term (eg, over Christmas or the summer lull). 

Forward starting products are low cost, but also lower payout 

We note that while forward starting products have a lower theta cost than vanilla options, if 
there is a rise in volatility surfaces before the forward starting period is over, they are likely 
to benefit less than vanilla options (this is because the front end of volatility surfaces tends 
to move the most, and this is the area to which forward start has no sensitivity). Forward 
starting  products  can  therefore  be  seen  as  a  low-cost,  lower-payout  method  of  trading 
volatility. 

TERM STRUCTURE PENALISES FWD STARTING PRODUCTS 

While forward starting products have zero mathematical theta, they do suffer from the fact 
that  volatility  and  variance  term  structure  is  usually  expensive  and  upward  sloping.  The 
average  implied  volatility  of  a  forward  starting  product  is  likely  to  be  higher than a  vanilla 
product, which will cause the long forward starting position to suffer carry as the volatility is 
re-marked lower12 during the forward starting period. 

SKEW CAUSES NEGATIVE SHADOW DELTA 

11 We shall assume that the investor wishes to be long a forward starting product. 
12  If  a  3-month  forward  starting  option  is  compared  to  a  3-month  vanilla  option,  then  during  the 
forward starting period the forward starting implied volatility should, on average, decline. 

                                                      
4.1: Forward Starting Products 

101 

The  presence  of  skew  causes  a  correlation  between  volatility  and  spot.  This  correlation 
produces a negative shadow delta for all forward starting products (forward starting options 
have a theoretical delta of zero). The rationale is similar to the argument that variance swaps 
have negative shadow delta due to skew. 

FIXED DIVIDENDS ALSO CAUSES SHADOW DELTA 

If a dividend is fixed, then the dividend yield tends to zero as spot tends to infinity, which 
causes a shadow delta (which is positive for calls and negative for puts). 

Proportional dividends reduce volatility of underlying 

Options, variance swaps and futures on volatility indices gain in value if dividends are fixed, 
as proportional dividends simply reduce the volatility of an underlying. 

THERE ARE 3 MAIN METHODS TO TRADE FORWARD VOL 

Historically, forward volatility could only be traded via forward starting options, which had 
to  be  dynamically  hedged  and,  hence,  had  high  costs  and  wide  bid-offer  spreads.  When 
variance swaps became liquid, this allowed the creation of forward starting variance swaps 
(as a forward starting variance can be perfectly hedged by a long and short position in two 
vanilla  variance  swaps  of  different  maturity,  which  is  explained  later).  The  client  base  for 
trading forward volatility has recently been expanded by the listing of forwards on volatility 
indices  (such  as  the  VIX  or  vStoxx).  The  definition  of  the  three  main  forward  starting 
products is given below: 

(1)  Forward starting options. A forward starting option is an option whose strike will be 
determined  at  the  end  of  the  forward  starting  period.  The  strike  will  be  quoted  as  a 
percentage  of  spot.  For  example,  a  one-year  ATM  option  three-month  forward  start, 
bought in September 2012, will turn into a one-year ATM option in December 2012 (ie, 
expiry  will  be  December  2013  and  the  strike  will  be  the  value  of  spot  in  December 
2012). Forward starting options are quoted OTC. For flow client requests, the maturity 
of the forward starting period is typically three months and with an option maturity no 
longer  than  a  year.  The  sale  of  structured  products  creates  significant  demand  for 
forward  starting  products,  but  of  much  longer  maturity  (2-3  years,  the  length  of  the 
structured product). Investment banks will estimate the size of the product they can sell 
and buy a forward starting option for that size. While the structured product itself does 
not  incorporate  a  forward  start,  as  the  price  for  the  product  needs  to  be  fixed  for  a 
period  of  1-2  months  (the  marketing  period),  the  product  needs  to  be  hedged  with  a 
forward start before marketing can begin. 

(2)  Forward  starting  variance  swaps.  The  easiest  forward  starting  product  to  trade  is  a 
variance swap, as it can be hedged with two static variance swap positions (one long, one 
short).  Like  plain  variance  swaps,  these  products  are  traded  OTC  and  their  maturities 

 
102 

CHAPTER 4: FORWARD STARTING PRODUCTS AND VOLATILITY INDICES 

can  be  up  to  a  similar  length  (although  investors  typically  ask  for  quotes  up  to  three 
years). 

(3)  Futures on volatility index. A forward on a volatility index works in the same way as a 
forward on an equity index: they both are listed and both settle against the value of the 
index  on  the  expiry  date.  While  forwards  on  volatility  indices  such  as  the  VIX  and 
vStoxx  have  been  quoted  for  some  time,  their  liquidity  has  only  recently  improved  to 
such  an  extent  that  they  are  now  a  viable  method  for  trading.  This  improvement  has 
been driven by increasing structured issuance and by options on volatility indices (delta 
hedging  of  these  options  has  to  be  carried  out  in  the  forward  market).  Current  listed 
maturities for the VIX and vStoxx exist for expiries under a year. 

HIGHER HEDGING RISKS INCREASE COST  

While forward starting options do not need to be delta hedged before the forward starting 
period ends, they have to be vega hedged with vanilla  straddles (or very OTM strangles if 
they are liquidity enough, as they also have zero delta and gamma). A long straddle has to be 
purchased on the expiry date of the option, while a short straddle has to be sold on the strike 
fixing date. As spot moves the strikes will need to be rolled, which increases costs (which are 
likely to be passed on to clients) and risks (unknown future volatility and skew) to the trader. 

Pricing of futures on vol indices tends to be slanted against long investors 

Similarly,  the  hedging  of  futures  on  volatility  indices  is  not  trivial,  as  (like  volatility  swaps) 
they require a volatility of volatility model. While the market for futures on volatility indices 
has become more liquid, as the flow is predominantly on the buy side, forwards on volatility 
indices  have  historically  been  overpriced.  They  are  a  viable  instrument  for  investors  who 
want to short volatility, or who require a listed product. 

Forward starting var swaps have fewer imbalances than other products 

The price – and the hedging – of a forward starting variance swap is based on two vanilla 
variance swaps (as it can be constructed from two vanilla variance swaps). The worst-case 
scenario for pricing is therefore twice the spread of a vanilla variance swap. In practice, the 
spread  of  a  forward  starting  variance  swap  is  usually  slightly  wider  than  the  width  of  the 
widest bid-offer of the variance swap legs (ie, slightly wider than the bid-offer of the furthest 
maturity).

(1) FORWARD STARTING OPTIONS 

A  forward  starting  option  can  be  priced  using  Black-Scholes  in  a  similar  way  to  a  vanilla 
option. The only difference is that the forward volatility (rather than volatility) is needed as 
an input13. The three different methods of calculating the forward volatility, and examples of 
how the volatility input changes, are detailed below: 

  Sticky  delta  (or  moneyness)  and  relative  time.  This  method  assumes  volatility 
surfaces never change in relative dimensions (sticky delta and relative time). This is not a 
realistic assumption unless the ATM term structure is approximately flat. 

  Additive  variance  rule.  Using  the  additive  variance  rule  takes  into  account  the  term 
structure of a volatility surface. This method has the disadvantage that the forward skew 
is assumed to be constant in absolute (fixed) time, which is not usually the case. As skew 
is normally larger for shorter-dated maturities, it should increase approaching expiry. 

  Constant  smile  rule.  The  constant  smile  rule  combines  the  two  methods  above  by 
using the additive variance rule for ATM options (hence, it takes into account varying 
volatility  over  time)  and  applying  a  sticky  delta  skew  for  a  relative  maturity.  It  can  be 
seen as ‘bumping’ the current volatility surface by the change in ATM forward volatility 
calculated using the additive variance rule. 

STICKY DELTA & RELATIVE TIME USES CURRENT VOL SURFACE 

If  the  relative  dimensions  of  a  volatility  surface  are  assumed  to  never  change,  then  the 
volatility input for a forward starting option can be priced with the current volatility surface. 
For example, a three-month 110% strike option forward starting after a period of time T can 
be  priced  using  the  implied  volatility  of  a  current  three-month  110%  strike  option  (the 
forward starting time T is irrelevant to the volatility input14). As term structure is normally 
positive, this method tends to underprice forward starting options. An example of a current 
relative volatility surface, which can be used for pricing forward starting options under this 
method, is shown below: 

13 Forwards of the other inputs, for example interest rates, are generally trivial to compute. 
14 Hence, the price of the three-month 110% option forward start will only be significantly different 
from the price of the vanilla three-month 110% option if there is a significant difference in interest 
rates or dividends.

ADDITIVE VARIANCE RULE CALCULATES FWD VOL 

As variance time weighted is additive, and as variance is the square of volatility, the forward 
volatility  can  be  calculated  mathematically.  Using  these  relationships  to  calculate  forward 
volatilities is called the additive variance rule and is shown below.

The  above  relationship  can be  used to  calculate forward  volatilities  for the  entire volatility 
surface. This calculation does assume that skew in absolute (fixed) time is fixed. An example, 
using the previous volatility surface, is shown below.

ATM ADDITIVE VAR + STICKY DELTA = CONST SMILE RULE 

Using a relative time rule has the advantage of pricing forward skew in a reasonable manner, 
but it does not price the change in term structure correctly. While pricing using the additive 
variance rule gives improved pricing for ATM options, for OTM options the skew used is 
likely to be too low (as the method uses forward skew, which tends to decay by square root 
of time). The constant smile rule combines the best features of the previous two approaches, 
with ATM options priced using the additive variance rule and the skew priced using sticky 
delta.

Constant smile rule bumps sticky delta relative time volatility surface 

The  above  diagrams  show  how  the  constant  smile  rule  has  the  same  ATM  forward 
volatilities as the additive variance rule. The static delta (relative time) skew is then added to 
these ATM options to create the entire surface. An alternative way of thinking of the surface 
is that it takes the current volatility surface, and shifts (or bumps) each maturity by the exact 
amount  required  to  get  ATM  options  to  be  in  line  with  the  additive  variance  rule.  The 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
106 

CHAPTER 4: FORWARD STARTING PRODUCTS AND VOLATILITY INDICES 

impact of having a relative time skew on a fixed ATM volatility can be measured by volatility 
slide theta (see the section A9.Advanced (Practical or Shadow) Greeks in the Appendix). 

CONSTANT SMILE RULE IS THE BEST MODEL OF THE THREE 

Pricing with static delta and relative time usually underprices forward volatility (as volatility 
term  structure  is  normally  upward  sloping,  and  long-dated  forward  volatility  is  sold  at  the 
lower levels of near-dated implied volatility). While additive variance correctly prices forward 
volatility, this rule does mean future skew will tend towards zero (as skew tends to decay as 
maturity increases and the additive variance rule assumes absolute – fixed – time for skew). 
While  this  rule  has  been  used  in  the  past,  the  mispricing  of  long-dated  skew  for  products 
such  as  cliquets  has  led  traders  to  move  away  from  this  model.  The  constant  smile  rule 
would appear to be the most appropriate. 

(2) FORWARD STARTING VAR SWAPS 

In  the  section  A2.Measuring  Historical  Volatility  in  the  Appendix  we  show  that  variance  is 
additive  (variance  to  time  T2  =  variance  to  time  T1  +  forward  variance  T1  to  T2).  This 
allows the payout of a forward starting variance swap between T1 and T2 to be replicated via 
a long variance swap to T2, and short variance swap to T1. We define N1 and N2 to be the 
notionals of the variance swaps to T1 and T2, respectively. It is important to note that N1 
and  N2  are  the  notionals  of  the  variance  swap,  not  the  vega  (N  =  vega  ÷  2  σ).  As  the 
variance  swap  payout  of  the  two  variance  swaps  must  cancel  up  to  T1,  the  following 
relationship  is  true  (we  are  looking  at  the  floating  leg  of  the  variance  swaps,  and  ignore 
constants that cancel such as the annualisation factor): 

Payout long var to T2 = Payout long var to T1 + Payout long var T1 to T2

Notional of the near-dated variance is smaller than notional of far-dated 

The above proof shows that in order to construct a forward starting variance swap from two 
vanilla  variance  swaps,  the  near-dated  variance  should  have  a  notional  of  T1/T2  (which  is 
less  than  1)  of  the  notional  of  the  far-dated  variance.  Intuitively,  this  makes  sense  as  the 
near-dated variance swap to T 1 only needs to cancel the overlapping period of the longer-
dated variance swap to T2. The notional of the near-dated variance swap to T1 therefore has 
to  be  scaled  down,  depending  on  its  relative  maturity  to  T2.  For  example,  if  T1  is  0,  then 
there is no need to short any near-dated variance and N 1 is similarly zero. In addition, if T 1 
= T2, then the two legs must cancel, which occurs as N1 = N2.The notional N12  must be 
equal to the difference of the notionals of the two vanilla variance swaps that hedge it (ie, 
N12 = N2 - N1) by considering the floating legs and having constant realised volatility (N2σ2

= N1σ1

 + N12 if volatility σ2 is constant).

Forward starting var swaps have fewer imbalances than other fwd products 

The price – and the hedging – of a forward starting variance swap is based on two vanilla 
variance swaps (as it can be constructed from two vanilla variance swaps). The worst-case 
scenario for pricing is therefore twice the spread of a vanilla variance swap. In practice, the 
spread  of  a  forward  starting  variance  swap  is  usually  slightly  wider  than  the  width  of  the 
widest bid-offer of the variance swap legs (ie, slightly wider than the bid-offer of the furthest 
maturity). 

(3) FUTURE ON VOLATILITY INDEX 

Futures  on  volatility  indices  have  become  one  of  the  most  popular  forward  starting 
products. For more details on both volatility indices, and futures on those indices, please see 
the following two sections 4.2: Volatility Indices and  4.3: Futures On Volatility Indices. 

 
 
4.2: Volatility Indices

4.2: VOLATILITY INDICES 

While volatility indices were historically based on ATM implied, most providers have 
swapped  to  a  variance  swap-based  calculation.  The  price  of  a  volatility  index  will, 
however,  typically  be  0.2-0.7pts  below  the  price  of  a  variance  swap  of  the  same 
maturity as the calculation of the volatility index typically chops the tails to remove 
illiquid  prices.  Each  volatility  index  provider  has  to  use  a  different  method  of 
chopping the tails in order to avoid infringing the copyright of other providers. 

THERE ARE 2 WAYS OF CALCULATING A VOLATILITY INDEX 

Historically, volatility indices (old VIX and VDAX) were based on ATM implied volatility. 
This  level  is  virtually  identical  to  the  fair  price  of  a  volatility  swap  (as  volatility  swaps  ≈ 
ATMf implied). This methodology has the advantage that it uses the most liquid strikes, and 
it is still used by some providers in less liquid markets for this reason. Due to the realisation 
that  variance,  not  volatility,  was  the  correct  measure  of  deviation,  on  September 22,  2003, 
the VIX index moved away from using ATM implied towards a variance-based calculation 
(and also moved from using the S&P100 to the S&P500). While the calculation is variance-
based, the index is quoted as the square root of variance for an easier comparison with the 
implied  volatility  of  options  (but  we  note  that  skew  and  convexity  mean  the  fair  price  of 
variance swaps and volatility indices should always trade above ATM options). 

Volatility indices based on ATM implied usually average 8 different options 

The old VIX, renamed VXO, took the implied volatility for the S&P100 strikes above and 
below spot for both calls and puts. As the first two-month expiries were used, the old index 
was  calculated  using  eight  implied  volatility measures  as  8  =  2 (strikes)  ×  2  (put/call)  ×  2 
(expiry).  Similarly,  the  VDAX  index,  which  was  based  on  DAX  45-day  ATM-implied 
volatility, has been superseded by the V1X index, which, like the new VIX, uses a variance-
based calculation. 

MOST INDICES NOW USE VARIANCE-BASED CALCULATIONS 

Variance-based  calculations  have  also  been  used  by  other  volatility  index  providers.  All 
recent volatility indices, such as the vStoxx (V2X), VSMI (V3X), VFTSE, VNKY and VHSI, 
use  a  variance  swap  calculation,  although  we  note  the  recent  VIMEX  index  uses  a  similar 
methodology  to  the  old  VIX  (due  to  illiquidity  of  OTM  options  on  the  Mexican  index). 
While  the  formula  for  a  variance  is  a  mathematical  formula  and  hence  not  subject  to 
copyright,  if  this formula  is  modified  to  exclude tails (eg,  requiring  a non-zero  bid  and/or 
offer  price,  excluding  strikes  too  far  away  from  spot,  etc),  then  this  calculation  becomes 
proprietary  and  is  subject  to  copyright.  This  is  the  reason  why  different  volatility  index 
providers have chosen different calculation methods. 

110 

CHAPTER 4: FORWARD STARTING PRODUCTS AND VOLATILITY INDICES 

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VOL INDICES AND VAR SWAPS 

While the calculation of a volatility index might be based on a variance swap calculation, the 
price of a volatility index will typically be lower than that of a variance swap. The magnitude 
of the difference depends on the calculation itself, the number of strikes with available prices 
and the difference in width between strikes. 

  Excluding very high and very low strikes. To increase the stability of the calculation, 
volatility  indices  exclude  the  implied  volatility  of  options  with  very  high  or  very  low 
strikes.  Given  the  importance  of  low  strike  implied  volatility  to  variance  swap  pricing, 
chopping the wings of low strike implieds has a greater impact than removing high strike 
implieds, hence the level of a volatility index is below the variance swap price (typically 
between 0.2 and 0.7 volatility points). 

  Discrete  sampling  by  using  only  listed  strikes.  When  pricing  a  variance  swap,  the 
value of a parameterised volatility surface is used. This surface is completely continuous 
and, hence, is not subject to errors due to using discrete data. As a volatility index has to 
rely on data from listed strikes, this introduces a small error which causes the level of the 
implied volatility index to be slightly below the variance swap price. 

  Noise  due  to  rolling  expiries.  If  a  volatility  index  does  not  interpolate  between 
expiries then the implied volatility will ‘jump’ when the maturity rolls from one expiry to 
another. This difference can be c2 volatility points. Some indices only interpolate over a 
few days and take an exact maturity the rest of the time, which smoothes this effect (but 
does not fully remove it). Indices calculated by the CBOE move from interpolation to 
extrapolation which will cause similar noise, but has a much smaller effect than rolling. 
The  average  value  from  a  volatility  index  that  uses  rolling  is  below  the  value  of  a 
variance swap as term structure is normally positive. 

  Linear  interpolation  between  expiries  (should  be  square  root  of  time).  Linearly 
interpolating  between  expiries  assumes  a  flat  volatility  term  structure.  In  reality,  a 
volatility surface follows a ‘square root of time’ rule, which means that the slope of term 
structure  is  steeper  for  near-dated  maturities  than  for  far  dated  ones.  As  a  volatility 
surface is normally upward sloping this means a volatility index is on average below the 
level of a variance swap (up to c0.8 volatility points).

Excluding very high and very low strikes lowers the value of a vol index 

ATM options are the most liquid, as they have the most time value. For very OTM options, 
not only is liquidity typically poor but a small change in price can have a large effect on the 
implied volatility. To improve reliability of calculation, the very high and very low strikes are 
excluded. This is either done via a fixed rule (ie, only use strikes between 80% and 120%) or 
by insisting on a bid price above zero. Requiring the existence of both bid and offer prices 
implicitly  chops  the  wings  as  well.  Excluding  the  tails  excludes  high  implied  volatility  low 
strike  options;  which  causes  the  level  of  the  volatility  index  to  be  below  the  fair  price  of 
variance swaps. The difference depends on the size of the tail that is chopped. If only strikes 
between 80% and 120% are used this can cause a discount of c0.7 volatility points between 
the 1-month volatility index and 1-month variance swaps. If all strikes with a liquid price are 
used then typically prices can be available for strikes between c60% and c120%, as downside 
puts are more liquid than upside calls (due to increased demand from hedging and due to the 
higher  premium  value  given  higher  implied  volatility).  Using  strikes  between  c60%  and 
c120% has a small discount to variance swaps of c0.2 volatility points. The VIX requires a 
non-zero bid and an offer, and stops when two consecutive options have no price.

CHAPTER 4: FORWARD STARTING PRODUCTS AND VOLATILITY INDICES 

Discrete sampling by using only listed strikes lowers value of vol index 

Even if prices were available for all strikes, a volatility index would give a slightly lower quote 
than variance swaps due to discretely sampling the implied volatility. The effect of discretely 
sampling a volatility surface can be modelled as a continuous volatility surface whose implied 
volatility  is  flat  near  the  listed  strikes  (and  jumps  in  between  the  listed  strikes).  Due  to 
volatility surface curvature, this effect causes the value of a volatility index to be lower than a 
variance swap (as can be seen in Figure 65 below). The effect of discretely sampling depends 
on the number of strikes available (ie, the price difference between strikes), but is very small 
compared  to  the  effect  of  chopping  the  tails  (but  both  are  caused  by  volatility  surface 
curvature).

Noise due to rolling depends on the calculation method 

There  are  volatility  indices  that  instead  of  linearly  interpolating  between  expiries  roll  from 
one  maturity  to  the  other.  For  similar  reasons  as  to  why  linearly  interpolating  a  volatility 
index  usually  gives  a  lower  value  than  a  variance  swap  (as  there  is  a  greater  difference 
between 0.5-month and 1-month implied than between 1-month and 1.5-month implied, i.e. 
the slope of term structure flattens as maturity increases), the average value for a volatility 
index that rolls is similarly too low. There will, however, be greater volatility for the index, 
due to the jump when the maturity rolls from one expiry to another. The difference between 
the  implied  volatility  of  the  front  two  expiries  can  be  c2  volatility  points.  Some  indices 
smooth this effect by interpolating for a few days, while having a fixed un-interpolated value 
the  rest of  the time.  Even  a  smoothed  calculation  will  have  a  higher  volatility  over  rolling 
than a fully interpolated based calculation. The CBOE ignores the front-month expiry in the 
final week before expiry and extrapolates from the second and third expiry. While this is a 
fully interpolated based calculation, jumping from using interpolation between the first and 
second expiry to extrapolation between the second and third can add some noise (but less 
noise than a roll-based calculation). We note that, as 30-day volatility futures expire exactly 
30 days before the vanilla expiry, no interpolation by maturity is necessary for settlement.

CHAPTER 4: FORWARD STARTING PRODUCTS AND VOLATILITY INDICES 

Interpolation between expiries usually lowers the value of a volatility index 

The  slope  of  near-dated  implieds  is  typically  steeper  than  far-dated  implieds,  as  volatility 
surfaces often move in a ‘square root of time’ manner (near-dated implieds fall more than 
far-dated implieds when volatility declines). Given the steeper slope of near-dated implieds, 
linearly  interpolating  underestimates  the  implied  volatility  for  positive  term  structure  (and 
similarly overestimates it for negative term structure). Typically, the demand for long-dated 
hedges  and  risk  aversion  causes  far-dated  implieds  to  be  greater  than  near-dated  implieds, 
hence  term  structure  is  normally  positive.  The  effect  of  linearly  interpolating  between 
maturities for a fixed maturity volatility index therefore causes a volatility index to normally 
underestimate a variance swap level. This effect will be greatest when the (typically 1-month) 
maturity of the volatility index is exactly in between listed expiries, and an extreme example 
is given in the graph above where the difference is c0.8 volatility points. We note that should 
the maturity of a volatility index lie close to a listed maturity the error due to interpolating 
between expiries will be close to zero.

4.3: FUTURES ON VOLATILITY INDICES 

While futures on volatility indices were first launched on the VIX in March 2004, it 
has  only  been  since  the  more  recent  launch  of  structured  products  and  options  on 
volatility futures that liquidity has improved enough to be a viable method of trading 
volatility.  As  a  volatility  future  payout  is  based  on  the  square  root  of  variance,  the 
payout  is  linear  in  volatility  not  variance.  The  fair  price  of  a  future  on  a  volatility 
index  is  between  the  forward  volatility  swap,  and  the  square  root  of  the  forward 
variance  swap.  Volatility  futures  are,  therefore,  short  vol  of  vol,  just  like  volatility 
swaps.  It  is  therefore  possible  to  get  the  implied  vol  of  vol  from  the  listed  price  of 
volatility futures. 

PRICE IS BETWEEN FORWARD VAR AND FORWARD VOL 

A  future  on  a  volatility  index  functions  in  exactly  the  same  way  as  a  future  on  an  equity 
index. However, as volatility future is a forward (hence linear) payout of the square root of 
variance, the payoff is different from a variance swap (whose payout is on variance itself). 
The price of a forward on a volatility index lies between the fair value of a forward volatility 
swap and the square root of the fair value of a forward variance swap. 

σ Forward volatility swap ≤ Future on volatility index ≤ σ Forward variance swap      

FUTURES ON VOLATILITY INDICES ARE SHORT VOL OF VOL 

A  variance  swap  can  be  hedged  by  delta  hedging  a  portfolio  of  options  (the  portfolio  is 
known as a log contract, where the weight of each option is 1/K2 where K is the strike). As 
the  portfolio  of  options  does  not  change,  the  only  hedging  costs  are  the  costs  associated 
with delta hedging. A volatility swap has to be hedged through buying and selling variance 
swaps (or a log contract of options); hence, it needs to have a volatility of volatility model. 
As  a  variance  swap  is  more  convex  than  a  volatility  swap  (variance  swap  payout  is  on 
volatility  squared),  a  volatility  swap  is  short  convexity  compared  to  a  variance  swap.  A 
volatility swap is, therefore, short volatility of volatility (vol of vol) as a variance swap has no 
vol of vol risk. As the price of a future on a volatility index is linear in volatility, a future on a 
volatility index is short vol of vol (like volatility swaps).

Forward volatility 

As vol of vol is underpriced, futures on volatility indices are overpriced 

While  the  price  of  volatility  futures  should  be  well  below  that  of  forward  variance  swaps, 
retail demand and potential lack of knowledge of the client base means that they have traded 
at similar levels. Using a stochastic local volatility model, we found that VIX futures15 should 
trade roughly half way between a variance future and a volatility future (in fact, slightly closer 
to forward volatility, as is to be expected for a product linear in volatility). While this means 
VIX futures should be c2pts below forward variance, they appear to only trade c1pt below. 
Similarly,  VIX  futures  should  be  only  c1-2pts  above  ATMf  implied  volatility,  but  during 
2012  they  were  c5-6pts  above  ATMf  implied  (see  Figure  68  below).  This  overpricing  of 
volatility  futures  means  that  volatility  of  volatility  is  underpriced  in  these  products.  Being 
short  volatility  futures  and  long  forward  variance  is  a  popular  trade  to  arbitrage  this 
mispricing. 

15 We assume a volatility index calculation matches that of a variance swap, ie, no chopping of tails.

VIX and S&P500 term structures are roughly parallel to each other 

We note that while the VIX futures term structure lies above S&P500 term structure, they 
are  approximately  parallel  to  each  other  for  the  same  reason  variance  term  structure  is 
parallel to ATMf term structure. While variance swaps are long skew and skew is lower for 
far-dated implieds, as OTM options gain more time value as maturity increases, these effects 
cancel each other out (hence, in the absence of supply and demand imbalances, variance and 
implied  volatility  term  structure  should  be  roughly  parallel  to  each  other).  As  equities 
typically have an upward sloping term structure, volatility futures term structure is typically 
upward sloping as well. Volatility futures, like variance swaps, are also long volatility surface 
curvature. Volatility futures will have the same seasonality of vol as the underlying security 
(eg, dips over Christmas and year-end). 

VOL OF VOL CAN BE BACKED OUT FROM VOL FUTURE PRICE 

A forward on a volatility future is short vol of vol. This means it is possible to back out the 
implied vol of vol from the price of this volatility future. This implied vol of vol can be used 
to price options on variance or even options on volatility futures themselves16. 

16 Assuming the volatility of volatility is log normally distributed.

EUREX WAS THE FIRST EXCHANGE TO LIST VOL FUTURES 

While futures on the VIX (launched by the CBOE in March 2004) are the oldest currently 
traded, the DTB (now Eurex) was the first exchange to list volatility futures, in January 1998. 
These  VOLAX  futures  were  based  on  3-month  ATM  implieds  but  they  ceased  trading  in 
December of the same year. More recently, futures based on the Russell 2000 traded from 
2007 until their delisting in 2010.

VOL FUTURES EXPIRE ON THIRD OR FOURTH WEDNESDAY 

Normal  options  expiry  is  on  the  third  Friday  of  the  month  (but  not  always;  for  example, 
Nikkei uses the second Friday), to be close to the end of the month and on a day that does 
not  usually  have  a  bank  holiday  (sometimes,  however,  Good  Friday  will  fall  on  the  third 
Friday).  For  US  markets,  the  expiration  is  on  the  Saturday  after  the  third  Friday  (to  give 
more  time  for  the  administration  of  expiration);  however,  as  the  last  trade  date  is  the 
Thursday before (expiration is based on opening prices on the Friday), this is irrelevant for 
cash-settled derivatives such as volatility futures. We note the extra time value due to expiry 
being on Saturday rather than Friday could be relevant for physical delivery, as an investor 
could  use  the  performance  of  different  markets  to  estimate  the  weekend  movements  and 
hence the likely opening price on Monday. As the only volatility futures currently listed are 
for volatility indices whose maturity is 30 days, the expiry of volatility futures is either the 
third  or  fourth  Wednesday  of  the  previous  month  (so  the  30-day  VIX  calculation  for 
settlement  price  is  based  on  only  one  maturity,  rather  than  an  interpolation  between  two 
maturities). This ensures that the settlement price is not subject to interpolation errors (see 
previous section) that affect volatility indices on other days. 

 
 
4.3: Futures on Volatility Indices

VIX SETTLEMENT PRICE COULD BE MANIPULATED 

As the settlement price for the VIX is based on opening trades on S&P500 options, it is far 
easier to manipulate than the settlement price for the vStoxx, which is based on a 30-minute 
average ending midday (CET). As shown earlier, the payout of a variance swap is based on a 
portfolio of options of all strikes weighted 1/K2, where K is the strike of the option. This 
means  the  calculation  of  variance  swaps  is  very  sensitive  to  the  price  of  downside  puts. 
Typically, there are offers for downside puts of all strikes at the tick value (ie, the smallest 
possible  non-zero  price),  as  these  puts  have  near  zero  theoretical  value.  As  the  VIX 
calculation requires a non-zero bid, these offers are usually excluded for strikes below c50%-
60%. By entering the minimum bid of US$0.05 (= tick value), these prices will be included in 
the calculation and could lift the settlement price by c1pt (as the implied volatility for these 
low strike puts will be very large). There have been times when the VIX settlement (on the 
open)  has  been  significantly  different  to  both  the  close  of  the  day,  and  the  close  of  the 
previous day. 

MEAN REVERSION MEANS VOL FUTURES HAVE DELTA <1 

Unlike normal futures, volatility futures are not linear in the underlying index (as the mean 
reversion of volatility has an effect) and, hence, have deltas significantly lower than 100%. 
An equity future has near a 100% delta. While the front month VIX future has a high 90% 
delta (delta vs the VIX), the 6-month VIX future has a lower 55% delta. The lower delta is 
due to the mean reversion of volatility, as 6-month VIX futures will not trade at 80% even if 
the VIX trades at 80% (as the VIX only briefly went above 80% post Lehman bankruptcy 
and swiftly declined, it is highly unlikely to still be at 80% in 6 months’ time). The empirical 
deltas of VIX futures by maturity are shown in Figure 70 below. These values decline in a 
similar way but less rapidly than they would if volatility solely obeyed a square root of time 
rule, which is to be expected as volatility surfaces sometimes move in parallel.

VIX futures delta is both time and volatility dependent 

While Figure 70 above gives the average delta of VIX futures over a 9-year period, over a 
shorter time period the delta can be significantly different. For values of the VIX above 40% 
the delta of a 6-month VIX future can be close to zero, as the market does not expect the 
high 40+% volatility environment to last six months as it is likely to be a temporary spike. 
For  values  of  the  VIX  below  30%-40%,  there  is  a  far  higher  delta,  as  moves  in  volatility 
within this range are more likely to be part of a volatility regime change that could be longer 
lasting. When estimating the delta of a volatility future care has to be taken when choosing 
the period of time used to find the estimate. Figure 71 below shows how the delta for a 6-
month VIX future over the 3-year period 2007-09 could be estimated to be 80%, however, 
in fact, the delta is actually c60% as there was a regime shift assuming higher future volatility 
post the 2008 peak in volatility post the Lehman bankruptcy. Note also how in the lead-up 
to the 2008 peak in volatility the 6-month VIX future appeared capped in the high 20s (and 
had near zero delta for values of VIX above 30%), whereas afterwards no such cap existed 
(and had high delta for value of VIX above 30%).

The  length  of  time  to mean  revert,  and  the  level  of  volatility  to  which  the  VIX will  mean 
revert,  changes  over  time.  Hence  the  R2  between  the  VIX  and  a  VIX  future  decreases  as 
maturity  increases.  While  the  front-month  VIX  future has  a  high  R2  of  0.97,  the  6-month

CHAPTER 4: FORWARD STARTING PRODUCTS AND VOLATILITY INDICES 

4.4: VOLATILITY FUTURE ETN/ETF 

Structured  products  based  on  constant  maturity  volatility  futures  have  become 
increasingly  popular  and  in  the  US  have  at  times  had  a  greater  size  than  the 
underlying volatility futures market. As a constant maturity volatility product needs 
to  sell  near-dated  expiries  and  buy  far-dated  expiries,  this  flow  supports  term 
structure  for  volatility  futures  and  the  underlying  options  on  the  index  itself.  The 
success of VIX-based products has led to their size being approximately two-thirds 
of the vega of the relevant VIX futures market (which is a similar size to the net listed 
S&P500  market)  and,  hence,  appears  to  be  artificially  lifting  near-dated  term 
structure. The size of vStoxx products is not yet sufficient to significantly impact the 
market,  hence  they  are  a  more  viable  method  of  trading  volatility  in  our  view.  We 
recommend  shorting  VIX-based  structured  products  to  profit  from  this  imbalance, 
potentially against long vStoxx based products as a hedge. Investors who wish to be 
long  VIX  futures  should  consider  the  front-month  and  fourth-month  maturities,  as 
their values are likely to be depressed from structured flow. 

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS IMPROVED FUTURES LIQUIDITY 

As it is impossible to have a product (perpetual or otherwise) whose payout is the volatility 
index  itself,  volatility  futures  were  launched  to  give  investors  an  easy  method  of  trading 
volatility. Initially, VIX and vStoxx futures had limited liquidity, potentially as they are not 
perpetual; however, the creation of perpetual structured products has improved the liquidity 
of volatility futures. Similarly, the introduction of options on these futures has increased the 
need  to  delta  hedge  using  these  futures,  also  increasing  liquidity.  In  the  US,  the  size  of 
structured products on VIX futures is so large at times it was bigger than the underlying VIX 
futures market and appears to have moved the underlying S&P500 market itself. 

VIX PRODUCTS ARE 2/3 OF THE SIZE OF FUTURES MARKET 

The size in vega of the US market for vanilla S&P500 options, VIX futures and VIX-based 
ETN/ETF is shown in Figure 72 below. As can be seen, the size of VIX-based ETN/ETFs 
is approximately two-thirds of the size of the relevant VIX future.

VIX FUTURES NOW SIMILAR SIZE TO NET OPTIONS MARKET 

While the size in vega of the S&P500 options market is c4 times bigger than the VIX futures 
market, this is a theoretical maximum for the market. In practice, if investors trade a spread 
(eg, call/put spread or ladder) the vega of these structures is far less than the combined vega 
of the individual legs (vega is the difference between the long and short legs, not the sum of 
the legs). There is also significant trade in synthetics (long call short put as a substitute for 
long  future)  for  non-triple  witching  expiries  as  S&P500  futures  only  exist  for  quarterly 
expiries.  In  addition,  as  one  cannot  cross  futures,  when  trading  on  swap  (trade  volatility 
structure delta hedged so price is not affected by movements in spot) the delta hedge is done 
via synthetics. Interest rate trades such as box spreads (long synthetic of one maturity and 
short  synthetic  of  another  maturity)  also  have  no  volatility  component.  A  reasonable 
assumption is that the size of the net vega of the S&P500 listed options market is c25% of 
the theoretical maximum. Hence, the size of the net listed S&P500 vega is similar to that of 
the VIX futures market. 

VIX futures market comparable to S&P500 vol market if OTC is included 

However, we estimate that the OTC market for the S&P500 is 50%-100% of the size of the 
listed  market.  This  is  due  to  the  significant  long-term  hedging  (eg,  from  variable  annuity 
programs) which cannot be done on exchange (as only maturities up to 2-3 years are listed 
on the S&P500). Additionally, the size of the variance swap market adds to the size of the 

 
 
 
124 

CHAPTER 4: FORWARD STARTING PRODUCTS AND VOLATILITY INDICES 

OTC market. Hence, we estimate the vega of VIX futures would be 50%-100% of the total 
(listed and OTC) size of the S&P500 market.

OPEN-ENDED VOL PRODUCTS STEEPEN TERM STRUCTURE 

While futures on a volatility index have the advantage of being a listed instrument, they have 
the  disadvantage  of  having  an  expiry  and,  therefore,  a  longer-term  position  needs  to  be 
rolled.  In  response  to  investor  demand,  many  investment  banks  sold  products  based  on 
having  a  fixed  maturity  exposure  on  an  underlying  volatility  index.  As  time  passes,  these 
banks hedge their exposure by selling a near-dated expiry and buying a far-dated expiry. The 
weighted average maturity is therefore kept constant, but the flow puts upward pressure on 
the term structure. For products of sufficient size, the impact of structured products on the 
market ensures the market moves against them. Products on short-dated VIX futures which 
have an average 1-month maturity (by selling front month and buying the second expiry) are 
now sufficiently large to be moving the volatility market for the S&P500.

Volatility products suffer ‘roll-down cost’ due to positive term structure 

Historically, due to risk aversion and supply demand imbalances, the average term structure 
of  implied  volatility  has  been  positive.  Index  implied  volatility  term  structure  will  also  be 
lifted by positive implied correlation term structure. The launch of volatility futures and their 
related ETN/ETF products has increased the supply demand imbalance and supported term 
structure for the S&P500. VStoxx products are not yet large enough to have an impact on 
SX5E  term  structure.  As  long  volatility  ETN/ETF  products  are  always  selling  near-dated 
implied  and  buying  far-dated  implied,  there  is  a  roll-down  cost  if  the  term  structure  is 
positive (as a low near-dated volatility future is sold and a high far-dated volatility future is 
bought). The higher the positive term structure, the greater the roll-down cost. Conversely, 
volatility ETN/ETF products will benefit from negative term structure. Investors tend not 
to  benefit from  the  periods  of  time  there  is  positive  roll-down  cost,  as  these  products  are 
often used as a hedge (or view on volatility increasing) and the position is typically closed if 
equity markets decline and volatility spikes.

ETN/ETF

Longer dated maturity ETN/ETF products have less roll-down cost, but 
lower beta 

Given  the  fact  term  structure  flattens  out  as  maturity  increases,  the  gradient  of  volatility 
surfaces  is  steeper  for  near-term  expiries  than  far-term  expiries.  This  means  structured 
products based on longer-dated volatility suffer less roll-down cost. This led to the creation 
of medium-dated ETN/ETFs, which have an average maturity of five months as they invest 
in futures of maturity 4, 5, 6 and 7 month (hence sells 4th future to buy 7th). However, as the 
beta of volatility futures decreases with maturity, longer-dated volatility products benefit less 
from  volatility  spikes.  While  the  ratio  of  beta  to  roll-down  cost  is  similar  across  different 
maturity  volatility  products,  near-dated  products  do  have  a  worse  ratio.  There  are  some 
products  that  try  to  benefit  from  the  excess  demand  for  near-term  1-month  ETN/ETFs 
(medium-dated  5-month  ETN/ETFs  are  less  popular)  by  going  short  a  1-month volatility 
product,  and  at  the  same  time  going  long  approximately  twice  that  size  of  a  5-month 
volatility product (as √5≈2 and volatility often moves in a square root of time manner).

Futures 1 and 4 have selling imbalance

BUYING FRONT MONTH OR 4TH MONTH VOL FUTURES IS BEST 
If an investor wishes to initiate a long volatility future position, the best future is the front-
month future as this has the most selling pressure from ETN/ETFs (and hence is likely to 
be  relatively  cheap).  For  investors  who  wish  to  have  a  longer-dated  exposure,  we  would 
recommend  the  fourth  volatility  future  as  our  second  favourite.  This  future  benefits  from 
the  selling  of  medium-dated  ETN/ETFs.  A  long  fourth  future  position  should  be  closed 
when  it  becomes  the  second  month  future  (as  this  price  is  supported  by  the  short  dated 
ETN/ETF). While the eight future is also a viable investment, the liquidity at this maturity is 
lower than the others. 

INVESTORS COULD SHORT VIX BASED ETN/ETFS 

Given  the  imbalance  in  the  VIX  futures  market  resulting  from  the  size  of  ETN/ETF 
products for near-dated VIX products, investors could short these products. The XXV ETF 
(inverse of the VXX, whose ticker is also the letters of the VXX backwards) based on short 
1-month VIX futures is also a viable method of profiting from this imbalance. As the size of 
the XXV is only c20% of the size of the VXX, a significant imbalance still remains in our

view. As vStoxx-based products are not sufficiently large to be causing an imbalance, a short 
VIX  product  long  vStoxx  product  is  an  attractive  way  to  profit  from  the  VIX  imbalance 
while hedging the overall level of volatility (we note that this trade does not hedge any US or 
Europe specific volatility). As can be seen in Figure 77 below, the profile of 1m vStoxx/1m 
VIX (proxy for long 1m vStoxx and short 1m VIX rebalanced every day) offers an attractive 
performance.

ETN HAS COUNTERPARTY RISK UNLIKE ETF 

There  are  both  ETNs  and  ETFs  based  on  volatility  futures,  the  primary  difference  being 
counterparty risk. Despite the fact the underlying of the product is listed (and hence has no 
counterparty risk), an investor in an ETN suffers the counterparty risk of the provider. ETFs 
do not suffer this problem. 

EXCESS RETURN PRODUCTS ARE SUPERIOR TO TOTAL RETURN 

For  investors  who  are  able  to  trade  them,  swaps  based  on  excess  return  indices  (eg, 
VST1ME  for  vStoxx  1-month  futures)  are  better  than  ETN/ETF  based  on  total  return 
indices (eg, VST1MT for vStoxx 1-month futures). This is because the returns received from 
a total return product (EONIA) are likely to be less than the funding levels of a client.

4.5: OPTIONS ON VOLATILITY FUTURES  

The  arrival  of  options  on  volatility  futures  has  encouraged  trading  on  the 
underlying futures. It is important to note that an option on a volatility future is 
an option on future implied volatility, whereas an option on a variance swap is an 
option  on  realised  volatility.  As  implieds  always  trade  at  a  lower  level  to  peak 
realised  (as  you  never  know  when  peak  realised  will  occur)  the  volatility  of 
implied is lower than the volatility of realised, hence options on volatility futures 
should  trade  at  a  lower  implied  than  options  on  var.  Both  have  significantly 
downward sloping term structure and positive skew. We note that the implied for 
options  on  volatility  futures  should  not  be  compared  to  the  realised  of  volatility 
indices.  

OPTIONS ARE ON THE FUTURE, NOT THE VOL INDEX ITSELF 

As volatility markets have become more liquid, investors became increasingly interested 
in  purchasing  options  on  volatility.  As  it  is  impossible  to  buy  a  volatility  index  itself, 
options  on  volatility  have  to  be  structured  as  an  option  on  a  volatility  future.  For 
equities there is not much difference between the volatility of spot and the volatility of a 
future (as futures are near dated, the effect of interest rate and implied dividend volatility 
is small).  However,  there  is  a  very  significant difference  between  the  volatility of  a  vol 
index, and the volatility of a vol future.

CHAPTER 4: FORWARD STARTING PRODUCTS AND VOLATILITY INDICES 

VOLATILITY TERM STRUCTURE IS VERY NEGATIVE 

The term structure of implied volatility of vanilla equity options is on average relatively 
flat17.  In  contrast,  the  term  structure  of  implied  volatility  of  option  on  vol  futures  is 
sharply  negative.  The  volatility  of  a  vol  future  is significantly  less  than the  volatility of 
the vol index, but does converge as it approaches expiry (when it becomes as volatile as 
the vol index itself). 

COMPARING IMPLIED VOL AND REALISED VOL IS DIFFICULT 

The  realised  volatility  of  a  vol  future  increases  as  it  approaches  expiry  (near-dated 
volatility is more volatile than far-dated volatility). The implied volatility of an option on 
a  vol  future  should  trade  roughly  in  line  with  the  average  realised  volatility  of  the  vol 
future  over  the  life  of  the  option.  Hence  the  average  realised  volatility  of  a  vol  future 
will be a blend of the initial low realised volatility, and the higher realised volatility close 
to expiry. The implied volatility term structure of an option on vol future will therefore 
be less negative than the realised volatility term structure of the vol future.  

Realised of vol futures < implied of option on vol futures < realised of vol 
index  

The  implied  volatility  level  of  options  on  vol  futures  is  also  higher  than  the  realised 
volatility of the vol future for that expiry (eg, implied of 6-month option on vol futures 
is above current realised of 6-month vol future). The implied volatility of options on vol 
futures  will,  however,  be  less than the realised  volatility  of the vol  index,  which  makes 
options on vol futures look cheap if an investor mistakenly compares its implied to the 
realised of the vol index. 

OPTION ON VOL FUTURE CHEAPER THAN OPTIONS ON VAR 

Implied  volatility  is  less  volatile  than  realised  volatility,  as  implied  volatility  will  never 
trade at the min or max level of realised (as it is an estimate of future volatility, and there 
is never a time that the market can be 100% certain realised will reach its min or max). 
As  implied  volatility  is  less  volatile  than  realised  volatility,  an  option  on  a  vol  future 
should be at a lower implied than an option on realised variance (particularly for near-
dated expiries). They will, however, have a similar negative term structure. 

17 On average slightly upward sloping, but at a far shallower gradient to the negative term structure of 
options on vol futures.

131 

Options on vol future have positive skew, just like options on var 

When  there  is  an  equity  market  panic,  there  tends  to  be  large  negative  returns  for 
equities and a volatility spike. As the probability distribution of equity prices has a greater 
probability  of  large  negative  returns,  it  has  a  negative  skew.  Volatility,  on  the  other  hand, 
tends to have a larger probability of large positive returns and hence has positive skew (just 
like options on realised variance).

Need to model volatility with high vol of vol and mean reversion 

As vol futures have a high near-term volatility, and low far-dated volatility, they have to be 
modelled with a high vol of vol and high mean reversion.

LIGHT EXOTICS 

Advanced investors can make use of more exotic equity derivatives. Some of the most 
popular  are  light  exotics,  such  as  barriers,  worst-of/best-of  options,  outperformance 
options, look-back options, contingent premium options, composite options and quanto 
options.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
134 

CHAPTER 5: LIGHT EXOTICS 

5.1: BARRIER OPTIONS 

Barrier  options  are  the  most  popular  type  of  light  exotic  product,  as  they  are  used 
within  structured  products  or  to  provide  cheap  protection.  The  payout  of  a  barrier 
option knocks in or out depending on whether a barrier is hit. There are eight types 
of barrier option, but only four are commonly traded, as the remaining four have a 
similar  price  to  vanilla  options.  Barrier  puts  are  more  popular  than  calls  (due  to 
structured product and protection flow), and investors like to sell visually expensive 
knock-in options and buy visually cheap knock-out options. Barrier options (like all 
light  exotics)  are  always  European  (if  they  were  American,  the  price  would  be 
virtually the  same  as  a  vanilla option,  as the options  could be  exercised  just  before 
the barrier was hit). 

BARRIER OPTIONS CAN HAVE DELTA OF MORE THAN ±100% 

The hedging of a barrier option is more involved than for vanilla options, as the delta near 
the  barrier  can  be  significantly  more  than  ±100%  near  expiry.  The  extra  hedging  risk  of 
barriers widens the bid-offer spread in comparison with vanilla options. Barrier options are 
always European and are traded OTC. 

THERE ARE THREE KEY VARIABLES FOR BARRIER OPTIONS 

There are three key variables to a barrier option, each of which has two possibilities. These 
combinations give eight types of barrier option (8=2×2×2). 

  Down/up.  The direction of the barrier in relation to spot. Almost all put barriers are 

down barriers and, similarly, almost all call barriers are up barriers. 

  Knock in/out. Knock-out (KO) options have a low premium and give the impression 
of being cheap; hence, they are usually bought by investors. Conversely, knock-in (KI) 
options are visually expensive (as knock-in options are a similar price to a vanilla) and 
are usually sold by investors (through structured products). For puts, a knock-in is the 
most popular barrier (structured product selling of down and knock-in puts). However, 
for calls this is reversed and knock-outs are the most popular. Recent volatility has made 
knock-out  products  less  popular  than  they  once  were,  as  many  hit  their  barrier  and 
became worthless. 

  Put/call.  The type of payout of the option. Put barriers are three to four times more 
popular  than  call  barriers,  due  to  the  combination  of  selling  from  structured  products 
(down and knock-in puts) and cheap protection buying (down and knock-out puts). 

5.1: Barrier Options 

135 

ONLY FOUR OF THE EIGHT TYPES OF BARRIER ARE TRADED 

The difference in price between a vanilla option and barrier option is only significant if the 
barrier occurs when the option has intrinsic value. If the only value of the option when the 
barrier knocks in/out is time value, then the pricing for the barrier option will be roughly 
equal to the vanilla option. Because of this, the naming convention for barrier options can 
be  shortened  to  knock  in  (or  out)  followed  by  call/put  (as  puts  normally  have  a  down 
barrier,  and  calls  an  up  barrier).  The  four  main  types  of  barrier  option  and  their  uses  are 
shown below. 

  Knock-in put (down and knock-in put). Knock-in puts are the most popular type of 
barrier option, as autocallables are normally hedged by selling a down and knock-in put 
to fund the high coupon. They have a barrier which is below both spot and strike and 
give an identical payoff to a put only once spot has gone below the down barrier. Until 
spot  reaches  the  down  barrier  there  is  no  payout.  However,  as  this  area  has  the  least 
intrinsic  value,  the  theoretical  price  is  similar  to  a  vanilla  and  therefore  visually 
expensive. 

  Knock-out  put  (down  and  knock-out  put).  Knock-out  puts  are  the  second  most 
popular  barrier  option  after  knock-in  puts  (although  knock-in  puts  are  three  times  as 
popular  as  knock-out  puts  due  to  structured  product  flow).  Knock-out  puts  give  an 
identical payout to a put, until spot declines through the down barrier (which is below 
both  spot  and  strike),  in  which  case  the  knock-out  option  becomes  worthless.  As  the 
maximum  payout  for  a  put  lies  below  the  knock-out  barrier,  knock-out  puts  are 
relatively cheap and are often thought of as a cheap method of gaining protection. 

  Knock-in call (up and knock-in call). Knock-in calls give an identical payout to a call, 
but  only  when  spot  trades  above  the  up  barrier,  which  lies  above  spot  and  the  strike. 
They are the least popular barrier option, as their high price is similar to the price of a 
call and structured product flow is typically less keen on selling upside than downside. 

  Knock-out call (up and knock-out call). Knock-out calls are the most popular barrier 
option for calls, but their popularity still lags behind both knock-in and knock-out puts. 
As they give the same upside participation as a vanilla call until the up barrier (which is 
above  spot  and  strike)  is  reached,  they  can  be  thought  of  as  a  useful  way  of  gaining 
cheap upside.

CHAPTER 5: LIGHT EXOTICS 

KNOCK-OUT DECREASE IN VALUE AS STRIKE APPROACHES 

While vanilla options (and knock-in options) will increase in value as spot moves further in 
the  money,  this  is  not  the  case  for  knock-out  options,  where  spot  is  near  the  strike.  This 
effect is caused by the payout equalling zero at the barrier, which can cause delta to be of 
opposite sign to the vanilla option. This effect is shown below for a one-year ATM put with 
80% knock-out. The peak value of the option is at c105%; hence, for values lower than that 
value  the  delta  is  positive  not  negative.  This  is  a  significant  downside  to  using  knock-out 
puts for protection, as their mark to market can increase (not decrease) equity sensitivity to 
the downside.

KNOCK-OUT PUT + KNOCK-IN PUT = (VANILLA) PUT 

If a knock-out put and a knock-in put have the same strike and barrier, then together the 
combined position is equal to a long vanilla put (PKO + PKI = P). This is shown in the charts 
below. The same argument can apply to calls (PKO + PKI = P). This relationship allows us to 
see  mathematically  that  if  knock-out  options  are  seen  as  visually  cheap,  then  knock-in 
options  must  be  visually  expensive  (as  a  knock-in  option  must  be  equal  to  the  price  of  a 
vanilla less the value of a visually cheap knock-out option).

CHAPTER 5: LIGHT EXOTICS 

KNOCK-OUTS COST C15%-25% OF PUT SPREAD COST 

The payout of a knock-out put is equal to a ‘shark fin’ (see top left chart in Figure 83 above) 
until the barrier is reached. A ‘shark fin’ is equal to a short digital position (at the barrier) 
plus a put spread (long put at strike of knock-out put, short put at barrier of knock-out put). 
The price of a knock-out put can therefore be considered to be the cost of a put spread, less 
a  digital  and  less  the  value  of  the  knock-out.  As  pricing  digitals  and  barriers  is  not  trivial, 
comparing the price of a knock-out put as a percentage of the appropriate put spread can be 
a quick way to evaluate value (the knock-out will have a lower value as it offers less payout 
to the downside). For reasonable barriers between 10% and 30% below the strike, the price 
of the knock-out option should be between c15% and c25% of the cost of the put spread. 

CONTINUOUS BARRIERS ARE CHEAPER THAN DISCRETE 

There are two types of barriers, continuous and discrete. A continuous barrier is triggered if 
the price hits the barrier intraday, whereas a discrete barrier is only triggered if the closing 
price  passes  through  the  barrier.  Discrete  knock-out  barriers  are  more  expensive  than 
continuous barriers, while the reverse holds for knock-in barriers (especially during periods 
of high volatility). There are also additional hedging costs to discrete barriers, as it is possible 
for spot to move through the barrier intraday without the discrete barrier being triggered (ie, 
if  the  close  is  the  correct  side  of the  discrete  barrier). As  these  costs  are  passed on  to the 
investor,  discrete  barriers  are  far  less  popular  than  continuous  barriers  for  single  stocks 
(c10%-20% of the market), although they do make up almost half the market for indices. 

Jumps in stock prices between close and open is a problem for all barriers 

While the hedge for a continuous barrier should, in theory, be able to be executed at a level 
close to the barrier, this is not the case should the underlying jump between close and open. 
In this case, the hedging of a continuous barrier suffers a similar problem to the hedging of a 
discrete barrier (delta hedge executed at a significantly different level to the barrier). 

DOUBLE BARRIERS ARE POSSIBLE, BUT RARE 

Double  barrier  options  have  both  an  up  barrier  and  a  down  barrier.  As  only  one  of  the 
barriers  is  significant  for  pricing,  they  are  not  common  (as  their  pricing  is  similar  to  an 
ordinary single-barrier option). They make up less than 5% of the light exotic market. 

 
5.1: Barrier Options 

139 

REBATES CAN COMPENSATE FOR TRIGGER OF BARRIER  

The main disadvantage of knock-out barrier options is that the investor receives nothing for 
purchasing  the  option  if  they  are  correct  about  the  direction  of  the  underlying  (option  is 
ITM)  but  incorrect  about  the  magnitude  (underlying  passes  through  barrier).  In  order  to 
provide compensation, some barrier options give the long investors a rebate if the barrier is 
triggered:  for  example,  an  ATM  call  with  120%  knock-out  that  gives  a  5%  rebate  if  the 
barrier is touched. Rebates comprise approximately 20% of the index barrier market but are 
very rare for single-stock barrier options. 

 
 
140 

CHAPTER 5: LIGHT EXOTICS 

5.2: WORST-OF/BEST-OF OPTIONS 

Worst-of  (or  best-of)  options  give  payouts  based  on  the  worst  (or  best)  performing 
asset. They are the second most popular light exotic due to structured product flow. 
Correlation is a key factor in pricing these options, and investor flow typically buys 
correlation  (making  uncorrelated  assets  with  low  correlation  the  most  popular 
underlyings). The underlyings can be chosen from different asset classes (due to low 
correlation), and the number of underlyings is typically between three and 20. They 
are always European, and normally ATM options. 

NORMALLY 1 YEAR MATURITY AND CAN BE CALLS OR PUTS 

Worst-of/best-of  options  can  be  any  maturity.  Although  the  most  popular  is  one-year 
maturity, up to three years can trade. As an option can be a call or a put, and either ‘worst-of’ 
or ‘best-of’; there are four types of option to choose from. However, the most commonly 
traded are worst-of options (call or put). The payouts of the four types are given below: 

Worst-of call = Max (Min (r1, r2,... , rN) , 0) where ri is the  return of N assets 

Worst-of put = Max (-Min (r1, r2,... , rN) , 0) where ri is the  return of N assets 

Best-of call = Max (Max (r1, r2,... , rN) , 0) where ri is the  return of N assets 

Best-of put = Max (-Max (r1, r2,... , rN) , 0) where ri is the  return of N assets 

WORST-OF CALLS ARE POPULAR TO BUY (AS CHEAP) 

The  payout  of  a  worst-of  call  option  will  be  equal  to  the  lowest  payout  of  individual  call 
options on each of the underlyings. As it is therefore very cheap, they are popular to buy. If 
all the assets are 100% correlated, then the value of the worst-of call is equal to the value of 
calls on all the underlyings (hence, in the normal case of correlation less than 100%, a worst-
of call will be cheaper than any call on the underlying). If we lower the correlation, the price 
of the worst-of call also decreases (eg, the price of a worst-of call on two assets with -100% 
correlation is zero, as one asset moves in the opposite direction to the other). A worst-of call 
option is therefore long correlation. As worst-of calls are cheap, investors like to buy them 
and, therefore, provide buying pressure to implied correlation.

141 

Rumour of QE2 lifted demand for worst-of calls on cross assets 

Before  QE2  (second  round  of  quantitative  easing)  was  announced,  there  was  significant 
buying  flow  for  worst-of  calls  on  cross  assets. The  assets  chosen  were  all  assets that  were 
likely  to  be  correlated  should  QE2  occur  but  that  would  normally  not  necessarily  be 
correlated (giving attractive pricing). QE2 was expected to cause USD weakening (in favour 
of other G10 currencies like the JPY, CHF and EUR), in addition to lifting ‘risk-on’ assets, 
like  equities  and  commodities.  The  buying  of  worst-of  calls  on  these  three  assets  would 
therefore  be  a  cheap  way  to  gain  exposure  to  the  expected  movements  of  markets  if 
quantitative easing was extended (which it was). 

WORST-OF PUTS ARE EXPENSIVE AND USUALLY SOLD 

A worst-of put will have a greater value than any of the puts on the underlying assets and is 
therefore very expensive to own. However, as correlation increases towards 100%, the value 
of the worst-of put will decrease towards the value of the most valuable put on either of the 
underlyings.  A  worst-of  put  is  therefore  short  correlation.  As  selling  (expensive)  worst-of 
puts is popular, this flow puts buying pressure on implied correlation (the same effect as the 
flow for worst-of calls). 

BEST-OF CALLS AND BEST-OF PUTS ARE RELATIVELY RARE 

While  worst-of  options  are  popular,  there  is  relatively  little  demand  for  best-of  options. 
There are some buyers of best-of puts (which again supports correlation); however, best-of 
calls are very rare. Figure 84 below summarises the popularity and direction of investor flows 
(normally from structured products) and the effect on implied correlation. A useful rule of 
thumb  for  worst-of/best-of  options  is  that  they  are  short  correlation  if  the  price  of  the 
option is expensive (worst-of put and best-of call) and the reverse if the price of the option 
is cheap. This is why the buying of cheap and selling of expensive worst-of/best-of options 
results in buying flow to correlation.

CHAPTER 5: LIGHT EXOTICS 

LIGHT EXOTIC OPTIONS FLOW LIFTS IMPLIED CORRELATION 

As  the  flow  from  worst-of/best-of  products  tends  to  support  the  levels  of  implied 
correlation, implied correlation typically trades above fair value. While other light exotic flow 
might  not  support  correlation  (eg,  outperformance  options,  which  are  described  below), 
worst-of/best-of  options  are  the  most  popular  light  exotic,  whose  pricing  depends  on 
correlation and are therefore the primary driver for this market. We would point out that the 
most  popular  light  exotics  –  barrier  options  –  have  no  impact  on  correlation  markets.  In 
addition,  worst-of/best-of 
in  uncorrelated  assets,  whereas 
is  concentrated 
outperformance options are usually on correlated assets.

5.3: Outperformance Options 

143 

5.3: OUTPERFORMANCE OPTIONS 

Outperformance  options  are  an  option  on  the  difference  between  returns  on  two 
different  underlyings.  They  are  a  popular  method  of  implementing  relative  value 
trades, as their cost is usually cheaper than an option on either underlying. The key 
unknown  parameter  for  pricing  outperformance  options  is  implied  correlation,  as 
outperformance  options  are  short  correlation.  The  primary  investor  base  for 
outperformance options is hedge funds, which are usually buyers of outperformance 
options on two correlated assets (to cheapen the price). Outperformance options are 
European and can always be priced as a call. Unless they are struck with a hurdle, 
they are an ATM option. 

OUTPERFORMANCE OPTIONS ARE SHORT-DATED CALLS 

Outperformance  options  give  a  payout  based  on  the  difference  between  the  returns  of  two 
underlyings.  While  any  maturity  can  be  used,  they  tend  to  be  for  maturities  up  to  a  year 
(maturities  less  than  three  months  are  rare).  The  payout  formula  for  an  outperformance 
option is below – by convention always quoted as a call of ‘rA over rB’’ (as a put of ‘r A over 
rB’ can be structured as a call on ‘rB over rA’). Outperformance options are always European 
(like all light exotics) and are traded OTC. 

Payout  =  Max  (rA  –  rB,  0)  where  rA  and  rB  are  the  returns  of  assets  A  and  B, 
respectively 

OPTIONS CAN HAVE HURDLE AND ALLOWABLE LOSS 

While  outperformance  options  are  normally  structured  ATM,  they  can  be  cheapened  by 
making it OTM through a hurdle or by allowing an allowable loss at maturity (which simply 
defers  the  initial  premium  to  maturity).  While  outperformance  options  can  be  structured 
ITM by having a negative hurdle, as this makes the option more expensive, this is rare. The 
formula for outperformance option payout with these features is: 

Payout = Max (rA – rB – hurdle, – allowable loss) 

OUTPERFORMANCE OPTIONS ARE SHORT CORRELATION 

The  pricing  of  outperformance  options  depends  on  both  the  volatility  of  the  two 
underlyings and the correlation between them. As there tends to be a more liquid and visible 
market  for  implied  volatility  than  correlation,  it  is  the  implied  correlation  that  is  the  key 
factor in determining pricing. Outperformance options are short correlation, which can be 
intuitively  seen  as:  the  price  of  an  outperformance  option  must  decline  to  zero  if  one 
assumes  correlation  rises  towards  100%  (two  identical  returns  give  a  zero  payout  for  the 
outperformance option). 

144 

CHAPTER 5: LIGHT EXOTICS 

As flow is to the buy side, some hedge funds outperformance call overwrite 

Outperformance  options  are  ideal  for  implementing  relative  value  trades,  as  they  benefit 
from  the  upside,  but  the  downside  is  floored  to  the  initial  premium  paid.  The  primary 
investor base for outperformance options are hedge funds. While flow is normally to the buy 
side, the overpricing of outperformance options due to this imbalance has led some hedge 
funds to call overwrite their relative value position with an outperformance option. 

MARGRABE’S FORMULA CAN BE USED FOR PRICING 

An outperformance option volatility σA-B can be priced using Margrabe’s formula given the 
inputs of the volatilities σA and σB of assets A and B, respectively, and their correlation ρ. 
This formula is shown below.

TEND TO BE USED FOR CORRELATED ASSETS 

The  formula  above  confirms  mathematically  that  outperformance  options  are  short 
correlation (due to the negative sign of the final term with correlation ρ). From an investor 
perspective, it therefore makes sense to sell correlation at high levels; hence, outperformance 
options tend to be used for correlated assets (so cross-asset outperformance options are very 
rare).  This  is  why  outperformance  options  tend  to  be  traded  on  indices  with  a  60%-90% 
correlation  and  on  single  stocks  that  are  30%-80%  correlated.  The  pricing  of  an 
outperformance  option  offer  tends  to  have  an  implied  correlation  5%  below  realised  for 
correlations  of  c80%,  and  10%  below  realised  for  correlations  of  c50%  (outperformance 
option offer is a bid for implied correlation). 

Best pricing is with assets of similar volatility 

The price of an outperformance is minimised if volatilities σA and σB of assets A and B are 
equal  (assuming  the  average  of  the  two  volatilities  is  kept  constant).  Having  two  assets  of 
equal volatility increases the value of the final term 2ρσAσB   (reducing the outperformance 
volatility σA-B). 

LOWER FORWARD FLATTERS OUTPERFORMANCE PRICING 

Assuming that the two assets have a similar interest rate and dividends, the forwards of the 
two assets approximately cancel each other out, and an ATM outperformance option is also 
ATMf  (ATM  forward  or  At  The  Money  Forward).  When  comparing  relative  costs  of 
outperformance options with call options on the individual underlyings, ATMf strikes must 
be  used.  If  ATM  strikes  are  used  for  the  individual  underlyings,  the  strikes  will  usually  be 
lower  than  ATMf  strikes  and  the  call  option  will  appear  to  be  relatively  more  expensive 
compared to the ATMf (= ATM) outperformance option. 

 
 
5.3: Outperformance Options 

145 

Pricing of ATM outperformance options is usually less than ATMf on either 
underlying 

If two assets have the same volatility (σA = σB) and are 50% correlated (ρ = 50%), then the 
input  for  outperformance  option  pricing  σA-B  is  equal  to  the  volatilities  of  the  two 
underlyings  (σA-B  = σA  =  σB).  Hence,  ATMf  (ATM  forward)  options  on  either  underlying 
will be the same as an ATMf (≈ATM) outperformance option. As outperformance options 
tend to be used on assets with higher than 50% correlation and whose volatilities are similar, 
outperformance options are usually cheaper than similar options on either underlying. 

 
 
146 

CHAPTER 5: LIGHT EXOTICS 

5.4: LOOK-BACK OPTIONS 

There  are  two  types  of  look-back  options,  strike  look-back  and  payout  look-back, 
and both are usually multi-year options. Strike reset (or look-back) options have their 
strike set to the highest, or lowest, value within an initial look-back period (of up to 
three months). These options are normally structured so the strike moves against the 
investor in order to cheapen the cost. Payout look-back options conversely tend to be 
more  attractive  and  expensive  than  vanilla  options,  as  the  value  for  the  underlying 
used is the best historical value. As with all light exotics, these options are European 
and OTC. 

STRIKE OF RESET OPTIONS MOVES AGAINST INVESTOR 

There  are  two  main  strike  reset  options,  and  both  have  an  initial  look-back  period  of 
typically one to three months, where the strike is set to be the highest (for a call) or lowest 
(for a put) traded value. While the look-back optionality moves against the investor, as the 
expiry of these options is multi-year (typically three), there is sufficient time for spot to move 
back  in  the  investor’s  favour,  and  the  strike  reset  cheapens  the  option  premium.  While 
having a strike reset that moves the strike to be the most optimal for the investor is possible, 
the high price means they are unpopular and rarely trade. While the cheaper form of strike 
reset  options  does  attract  some  flow  due  to  structured  products,  they  are  not  particularly 
popular. 

Strike resets are cheaper alternative to ATM option at end of reset period 

There are three possible outcomes to purchasing a strike reset option. Strike reset options 
can be considered a cheaper alternative to buying an ATM option at the end of the strike 
reset period, as the strike is roughly identical for two of the three possible outcomes (but at a 
lower price). 

  Spot  moves  in  direction  of  option  payout.  If  spot  moves  in  a  direction  that  would 
make the option ITM, the strike is reset to be equal to spot as it moves in a favourable 
direction, and the investor is left with a roughly ATM option. 

  Range-trading markets. Should markets range trade, the investor will similarly receive 

a virtually ATM option at the end of the strike reset period. 

  Spot  moves  in  opposite  direction  to  option  payout.  If  spot  initially  moves  in  the 
opposite  direction  to the  option  payout  (down for  calls,  up  for  puts),  then  the  option 
strike is identical to an option that was initially ATM (as the key value of the underlying 
for  the  strike  reset  is  the  initial  value)  and,  hence,  OTM  at  the  end  of  the  strike  rest 
period. The downside of this outcome is why strike reset options can be purchased for a 
lower cost than an ATM option. 

5.4: Look-Back Options 

147 

Strike resets perform best when there is an initial period of range trading 

Strike  reset  options  are  therefore  most  suitable  for  investors  who  believe  there  will  be  an 
initial period of range trading, before the underlying moves in a favourable direction. 

PAYOUT LOOK-BACK OPTIONS 

Having  a  look-back  option  that  selects  the  best  value  of  the  underlying  (highest  for  calls, 
lowest for puts) increases the payout of an option – and cost. These options typically have a 
five-year maturity and typically use end-of-month or end-of-year values for the selection of 
the optimal payout. 

 
 
148 

CHAPTER 5: LIGHT EXOTICS 

5.5: CONTINGENT PREMIUM OPTIONS 

Contingent premium options are initially zero-premium and only require a premium 
to be paid if the option becomes ATM on the close. The contingent premium to be 
paid is, however, larger than the initial premium would be, compensating for the fact 
that it might never have to be paid. Puts are the most popular, giving protection with 
zero  initial  premium.  These  typically  one-year  put  options  are  OTM  (or  the 
contingent  premium  would  almost  certainly  have  to  be  paid  immediately)  and 
European. 

CONTINGENT PREMIUM OPTION HAS ZERO UPFRONT COST 

While  contingent  premium  calls  are  possible,  the  most  popular  form  is  for  a  contingent 
premium put to allow protection to be bought with no initial cost. The cost of the premium 
to  be  paid  is  roughly  equal  to  the  initial  premium  of  the  vanilla  option,  divided  by  the 
probability of spot trading through the strike at some point during the life of the option (eg, 
an 80% put whose contingent premium has to be paid if the underlying goes below 80%). 
Using contingent premium options for protection has the benefit that no cost is suffered if 
the  protection  is  not  needed,  but  if  spot  dips  below  the  strike/barrier,  then  the  large 
premium has to be paid (which is likely to be more than the put payout unless there was a 
large decline). These can be thought of as a form of ‘crash put’. 

Conditional premium on a level other than strike is possible, but rare 

The  usual  structure  for  contingent  premium  options  is  to  have  the  level  at  which  the 
premium is paid equal to the strike. The logic is that although investors have to pay a large 
premium,  they  do  have  the  benefit  of  holding  an  option  that  is  slightly  ITM.  Having  the 
conditional premium at a level other than strike is possible, but rare (eg, an 80% put whose 
contingent premium has to be paid if the underlying reaches 110%). 

 
5.6: Composite and Quanto Options 

149 

5.6: COMPOSITE AND QUANTO OPTIONS 

There  are  two  types  of  option  involving  different  currencies.  The  simplest  is  a 
composite option, where the strike (or payoff) currency is in a different currency to 
the  underlying.  A  slightly  more  complicated  option  is  a  quanto  option,  which  is 
similar to a composite option, but the exchange rate of the conversion is fixed. 

COMPOSITE OPTIONS USE DIFFERENT VOLATILITY INPUT 

A  composite  option  is  a  cash  or  physical  option  on  a  security  whose  currency  is different 
from the strike or payoff currency (eg, Euro strike option on Apple). If an underlying is in a 
foreign currency, then its price in the payout (or strike) currency will usually be more volatile 
(and  hence  more  expensive)  due  to  the  additional  volatility  associated  with  currency 
fluctuations.  Only  for  significantly  negative  correlations  will  a  composite  option  be  less 
expensive  than  the  vanilla  option  (if  there  is  zero  correlation  the  effect  of  FX  still  lifts 
valuations). The value of a composite option can be calculated using Black-Scholes as usual, 
by  substituting the  volatility  of the  asset  with  the  volatility  of the  asset  in  payout  currency 
terms. The payout (or strike) currency risk-free rate should be used rather than the (foreign) 
security  currency  risk-free  rate.  The  dividend  yield  assumption  is  unchanged  (as  it  has  no 
currency) between a composite option and a vanilla option.

150 

CHAPTER 5: LIGHT EXOTICS 

Composite options are long correlation (if FX is foreign currency in domestic 
terms) 

The  formula  to  calculate  the  volatility  of  the  underlying  is  given  above.  As  the  payoff 
increases with a positive correlation between FX and the underlying, a composite option is 
long correlation (the positive payout will be higher due to FX, while FX moving against the 
investor  is  irrelevant  when  the  payout  is  zero).  Note  that  care  has  to  be  taken  when 
considering the definition of the FX rate; it should be the (foreign) security currency given in 
(domestic) payoff currency terms. 

For  example,  if  we  are  pricing  a  euro  option  on  a  dollar-based  security  and  assume  an 
extreme case of ρ = 100%, the volatility of the USD underlying in EUR will be the sum of 
the volatility of the underlying and the volatility of USD. 

QUANTO OPTIONS USE DIFFERENT DIVIDEND INPUT 

Quanto options are similar to a composite option, except the payout is always cash settled 
and a fixed FX rate is used to determine the payout. Quanto options can be modelled using 
Black-Scholes. As the FX rate for the payout is fixed, quanto options are modelled using the 
normal volatility of the underlying (as FX volatility has no effect). The payout is simply the 
fixed  FX  rate  multiplied  by  the  price  of  a  vanilla  option  with  the  same  volatility,  but  a 
different carry. The carry (risk-free rate - dividend) to be used is shown below (the risk-free 
rate for quanto options is assumed to be the risk-free rate of the security currency, ie, it is 
not the same as for composite options).

5.6: Composite and Quanto Options 

151 

Quanto options are either long or short correlation depending on the sign of 
the delta 

The  correlation  between  the  FX  and  the  security  has  an  effect  on  quanto  pricing,  the 
direction (and magnitude) of which depends on the delta of the option. This is because the 
dividend  risk  of  an  option  is  equal  to  its  delta,  and  the  dividend  used  in  quanto  pricing 
increases as correlation increases.  

Quanto option calls are short correlation (if FX is foreign currency in 
domestic terms) 

As a call option is short dividends (call is an option on the price of underlying, not the total 
return of the underlying), a quanto call option is short correlation. A quanto put option is 
therefore  slightly  long  correlation.  In  both  cases,  we  assume  the  FX  rate  is  the  foreign 
security currency measured in domestic payout terms. 

Intuitively,  we  can  see  a  quanto  call  option  is  short  correlation  by  assuming  the  dividend 
yield and both currency risk-free rates are all zero and comparing its value to a vanilla call 
option priced in the (foreign) security currency. If correlation is high, the vanilla call option 
is worth more than the quanto call option (as FX moves in favour of the investor if the price 
of the security rises). The reverse is also true (negative correlation causes a vanilla call option 
to  be  worth  less than  a  quanto  call  option).  As  the  price  of  a  vanilla  (single  currency)  call 
does  not  change  due  to  the  correlation  of  the  underlying  with  the  FX  rate,  this  shows  a 
quanto call option is short correlation.

RELATIVE VALUE AND CORRELATION 
TRADING 

Advanced  investors  often  use  equity  derivatives  to  gain  different  exposures;  for 
example, relative value or the jumps on earnings dates. We demonstrate how this can 
be done and also reveal how profits from equity derivatives are both path dependent 
and dependent on the frequency of delta hedging.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
154 

CHAPTER 6: RELATIVE VALUE AND CORRELATION TRADING 

6.1: RELATIVE VALUE TRADING 

Relative value is the name given to a variety of trades that attempt to profit from the 
mean  reversion  of  two  related  assets  that  have  diverged.  The  relationship  between 
the  two  securities  chosen  can  be  fundamental  (different  share  types  of  same 
company  or  significant  cross-holding)  or  statistical  (two  stocks  in  same  sector). 
Relative  value  can  be  carried  out  via  cash  (or  delta-1),  options  or  outperformance 
options. 

TRADES ARE USUALLY CHOSEN ON CORRELATED ASSETS 

The  payout  of  a  relative  value  trade  on  two  uncorrelated  securities  is  completely  random, 
and  the  investor  on  average  gains  no  benefit.  However,  if  two  securities  have  a  strong 
fundamental  or  statistical  reason  to  be  correlated,  they  can  be  thought  of  as  trading  in  a 
similar  direction  with  a  random  noise  component.  Assuming  the  correlation  between  the 
securities  is  sufficiently  strong,  the  noise  component  should  mean  revert.  Relative  value 
trades attempt to profit from this mean reversion. There are five main types of relative value 
trades. 

  Dual  listing.  If  a  share  trades  on  different  exchanges  (eg,  an  ADR),  the  two  prices 
should  be  equal.  This  is  not  always  the  case  due  to  execution  risk  (different  trading 
times) and perhaps due to indexation flow. Non-fungible shares or those with shorting 
restrictions are most likely to show the largest divergence in price. Of all relative value 
trades, dual-listing ones are likely to show the strongest correlation. 

  Share class. If there is more than one type of share, perhaps with voting or ownership 
restrictions, then the price of these shares can diverge from one another. For example, 
preference  shares  typically  have  a  higher  dividend  to  compensate  for  lack  of  voting 
rights, but suffer from less liquidity and (normally) exclusion from equity indices. During 
special  situations,  for  example,  during  the  Porsche/VW  saga,  the  difference  in  price 
between the two shares can diverge dramatically.  

  Cross-holding.  If  one  company  (potentially  a  holding  company)  owns  a  significant 
amount of another company, the prices of the two companies will be linked. Sometimes 
putting on a cross-holding trade is difficult in practice due to the high borrow cost of 
the smaller company. This trade is also known as a stub trade when the investor wants 
pure  exposure  to  the  larger  company,  and  hedges  out  the  unwanted  exposure  to  the 
equity holdings of the larger company. Potentially, these trades can occur when a larger 
company spins off a subsidiary but keeps a substantial stake post spin-off. 

 
 
6.1: Relative Value Trading 

155 

  Event-driven. In the event of a takeover that is estimated to have a significant chance 
of  succeeding,  the  share  prices  of  the  acquiring  and  target  company  should  be 
correlated. The target will usually trade at a discount to the bid price, to account for the 
probability the deals falls through (although if the offer is expected to be improved, or 
beaten by another bidder, the target could trade above the offer price). 

  Long-short. If a long and short position is initiated in two securities that do not have 
one of the above four reasons to be correlated, it is a long-short trade. The correlation 
between  the  two  securities  of  a  long-short  trade  is  likely  to  be  lower  than  for  other 
relative  values  trades.  Because  of  this,  often  two  stocks  within  a  sector  are  chosen,  as 
they  should  have  a  very  high  correlation  and  the  noise  component  is  likely  to  be 
bounded (assuming market share and profitability is unlikely to change substantially over 
the period of the relative value trade). 

Long-short can focus returns on stock picking ability (which is c10% of equity 
return) 

General market performance is typically responsible for c70% of equity returns, while c10% 
is due to sector selection and the remaining c20% due to stock picking. If an investor wishes 
to focus returns on the proportion due to sector or stock picking, they can enter into a long 
position in that security and a short position in the appropriate market index (or vice versa). 
This will focus returns on the c30% due to sector and stock selection. Typically, relatively 
large stocks are selected, as their systematic risk (which should cancel out in a relative value 
trade) is usually large compared to specific risk. Alternatively, if a single stock in the same 
sector (or sector index) is used instead of the market index, then returns should be focused 
on the c20% due to stock picking within a sector. 

SIZE OF POSITIONS SHOULD BE WEIGHTED BY BETA 

If the size of the long-short legs are chosen to have equal notional (share price × number of 
shares × FX), then the trade will break even if both stock prices go to zero. However, the 
legs of the trade are normally weighted by beta to ensure the position is market neutral for 
more modest moves in the equity market. The volatility (historical or implied) of the stock 
divided by the average volatility of the market can be used as an estimate of the beta. 

DELTA-1, OPTIONS AND OUTPERFORMANCE OPTIONS 

trades  can  be 

Relative  value 
implemented  via  cash/delta-1,  vanilla  options  or 
outperformance options. They have very different trade-offs between liquidity and risk. No 
one method is superior to others, and the choice of which instrument to use depends on the 
types of liquidity and risk the investor is comfortable with.

(1)  CASH/DELTA-1: BEST LIQUIDITY, BUT UNLIMITED RISK 

The deepest and most liquid market for relative value trades is the cash (or delta-1) market. 
While  there  are  limited  restrictions  in  the  size  or  stocks  available,  the  trade  can  suffer 
potentially  unlimited  downside.  While  there  are  many  similarities  between  cash  or  delta-1 
instruments, there are also important differences. 

Benefits of more beneficial taxation can be shared 

For many delta-1 products, the presence of investors with more beneficial taxation can result 
in more competitive pricing. Products that have to be based in one location, such as ETFs, 
suffer from being unable to benefit from the different taxation of other investors. 

(2)  OPTIONS: CONVEX PAYOFF AND CAN LIMIT DOWNSIDE ON LONG LEG 

Options  can  be  used  in  place  of  stock  or  delta-1  for  either  the  long  or  short  leg,  or 
potentially  both.  Options  offer  convexity,  allowing  a  position  to  profit  from  the  expected 
move  while  protecting  against  the  potentially  unlimited  downside.  Often  a  relative  value 
trade will be put on in the cash/delta-1 market, and the long leg rotated into a call once the 
long leg is profitable (in order to protect profits). While volatility is a factor in determining 
the attractiveness of using options, the need for safety or convexity is normally the primary 
driver for using options (as relative value traders do not delta hedge, the change in implied 
volatility is less of a factor in profitability than the delta/change in equity market). Investors 
who are concerned about the cost of options can cheapen the trade by using call spreads or 
put spreads in place of vanilla calls or puts. 

 
 
6.1: Relative Value Trading 

157 

Weighting options by volatility is similar to weighting by beta and roughly 
zero cost 

The most appropriate weighting for two relative value legs is beta weighting the size of the 
delta  hedge  of  the option  (ie,  same  beta  ×  number  of options  ×  delta  ×  FX),  rather  than 
having identical notional (share price × number of options × FX). Beta weighting ensures 
the  position  is  market  neutral.  Volatility  weighting  can  be  used  as  a  substitute  for  beta 
weighting, as volatility divided by average volatility of the market is a reasonable estimate for 
beta. Volatility weighting ATM (or ATMf) options is roughly zero cost, as the premium of 
ATM options is approximately linear in volatility. 

Choosing strike and maturity of option is not trivial 

One  disadvantage  of  using  options  in  place  of  equity  is  the  need  to  choose  a  maturity, 
although  some  investors  see  this  as  an  advantage  as  it  forces  a  view  to  be  taken  on  the 
duration  or  exit  point  of  the  trade  at  inception.  If  the  position  has  to  be  closed  or  rolled 
before expiry, there are potentially mark-to-market risks. Similarly, the strike of the option 
needs  to  be  chosen,  which  can  be  ATM  (at  the  money),  ATMf  (ATM  forward),  same 
percentage  of  spot/forward  or  same  delta.  Choosing  the  same  delta  of  an  OTM  option 
means trading a strike further away from spot/forward for the more volatile asset (as delta 
increases as volatility increases). We note that trading the same delta option is not the same 
as volatility weighting the options traded as delta is not linear in volatility. Delta also does 
not take into account the beta of the underlyings. 

(3)  OUTPERFORMANCE  OPTIONS:  LIMITED  DOWNSIDE  BUT  LOW 

LIQUIDITY 

Outperformance options are ideally suited to relative value trades, as the maximum loss is 
the premium paid and the upside is potentially unlimited. However, outperformance options 
suffer  from  being  relatively  illiquid.  While  pricing  is  normally  cheaper  than  vanilla  options 
(for  normal  levels  of  correlation),  it  might  not  be  particularly  appealing  depending  on  the 
correlation  between  the  two  assets.  As  there  are  usually  more  buyers  than  sellers  of 
outperformance options, some hedge funds use outperformance options to overwrite their 
relative value trades.

CHAPTER 6: RELATIVE VALUE AND CORRELATION TRADING 

6.2: RELATIVE VALUE VOLATILITY TRADING 

Volatility investors can trade volatility pairs in the same way as trading equity pairs. 
For  indices,  this  can  be  done  via  options,  variance  swaps  or  futures  on  a  volatility 
index  (such  as  the  VIX  or  vStoxx).  For  indices  that  are  popular  volatility  trading 
pairs, if they have significantly different skews this can impact the volatility market. 
Single-stock relative value volatility trading is possible, but less attractive due to the 
wider bid-offer spreads. 

TWO WAYS TO PROFIT FROM VOLATILITY PAIR TRADING 

When  a  pair  trade  between  two  equities  is  attempted, the  main  driver of  profits  is  from  a 
mean reversion of the equity prices. With volatility relative value trading, there are two ways 
of profiting: 

  Mean reversion. In the same way an equity pair trade profits from a mean reversion of 
stock prices, a volatility pair trade can profit from a mean reversion of implied volatility. 
For short-term trades, mean reversion is the primary driver for profits (or losses). For 
relative  value  trades  using  forward  starting  products  (eg,  futures  on  volatility  indices), 
this is the only driver of returns as forward starting products have no carry. The method 
for  finding  suitable  volatility  pair  trades  that  rely  on  a  short-term  mean  reversion  are 
similar to that for a vanilla pair trade on equities. 

  Carry. For an equity pair trade, the carry of the position is not as significant as, typically, 
the dividend yields of equities do not differ much from one another and are relatively 
small  compared  to  the  movement  in  spot.  However,  the  carry  of  a  volatility  trade 
(difference  between  realised  volatility  and  implied  volatility)  can  be  significant.  As  the 
duration of a trade increases, the carry increases in importance. Hence, for longer term 
volatility pair trades it is important to look at the difference between realised and implied 
volatility. 

IMPLIED VOL SPREAD BETWEEN PAIRS IS KEPT STABLE 

While  the  skew  of  different  indices  is  dependent  on  correlation,  traders  tend  to  keep  the 
absolute difference in implied volatility stable due to mean reversion. This is why if equity 
markets  move  down,  the  implied  volatility  of  the  S&P500  or  FTSE  (as  they  are  large 
diversified  indices  that  hence  have  high  skew)  tends  to  come  under  pressure,  while  the 
implied volatility of country indices with fewer members, such as the DAX, are likely to be 
supported. The SX5E tends to lie somewhere in between, as it has fewer members than the 
S&P500 or FTSE but is more diverse than other European country indices. Should markets 
rise, the reverse tends to occur (high skew indices implieds are lifted, low skew implieds are 
weighed on). 

6.2: Relative Value Volatility Trading 

159 

Difference between implieds is key, not the absolute level of each implied 

We note that for returns due to mean reversion, it is not the absolute level of volatility that is 
key but the difference. For example, let us assume stock A implieds trade between 20% and 
25% while stock B implieds trade between 30% and 35%. If stock A is at 25% implied (top 
of range) while stock B implied is at 30% implied (bottom of range), a short A volatility long 
B volatility position should be initiated. This is despite the 25% implied of A being less than 
the 30% implied of B. 

VOLATILITY PAIR TRADING GREEKS SIMILAR TO DISPERSION 

In dispersion trading, a (normally short) index volatility position is traded against a basket of 
(normally  long)  single-stock  volatility  positions.  This  position  of  index  volatility  vs  basket 
could  be  considered  to be a  pair  trade  where  one  leg  is  the  index  and  the  other  leg  is  the 
basket. A pair trade can be carried out via straddles / strangles or variance swaps, just like 
dispersion. We shall assume that the pair trade is being carried out by delta hedging options, 
for trading via variance swaps simply replaces notional in the table below with the vega of 
the  variance  swap. The  weighting  of  the  legs  in  order to  be  vega  / theta  or  gamma  flat  is 
similar to dispersion trading, as can be seen below.

Sign of theta, vega and gamma depends on which way round the pair trade is 
initiated 

The  sign  of  theta,  vega  and  gamma  are  based  on  a  trade  of  shorting  the  lower  volatility 
security and going long the higher volatility security (on an absolute basis) in order for easy 
comparison to dispersion trading (where, typically, the lower absolute volatility of the index 
is shorted against a long of the higher absolute volatility of the single stocks). For the reverse 
trade  (short  the  higher  absolute  volatility  security  and  long  the  lower  absolute  volatility 
security), the signs of the Greeks need to be reversed.

CHAPTER 6: RELATIVE VALUE AND CORRELATION TRADING 

PAIR TRADES CAN BE THETA OR VEGA WEIGHTED 

Theta  and  vega  weighted  are  the  most  common  methods  of  weighting  pair  trades.  Dollar 
gamma  weighted  is  rarely  used  and  is  included  for  completeness  purposes  only.  Theta-
weighted trades assume proportional volatility changes (eg, if stock A has 20% implied and 
stock B has 25% implied, if stock A rises from 20% to 30% implied that is a 50% increase 
and  stock  B  rises  50%  to  37.5%  implied).  Vega-weighted  trades  assume  absolute  volatility 
changes (eg, if stock A has 20% implied and stock B has 25% implied, if stock A rises from 
20% to 30% that is a 10 volatility point increase and stock B rises 10 volatility points to 35% 
implied). 

Pair trade between two securities of same type should be theta weighted 

If a pair trade between two securities of the same type (ie, two indices, or two single stocks) 
is attempted, theta weighting is the most appropriate. This is because the difference between 
a low volatility security and a high volatility security (of the same type) usually increases as 
volatility  increases (ie,  a  proportional  move).  If  a pair trade  between  an  index  and a  single 
stock  is  attempted,  vega  weighting  is  the  best  as  the  implied  volatility  of  an  index  is 
dependent  not  only  on  single-stock  implied  volatility  but  also  on  implied  correlation.  As 
volatility and correlation tend to move in parallel, this means the payout of a vega-weighted 
pair trade is less dependent on the overall level of volatility (hence the volatility mispricing 
becomes a more significant driver of the P&L of the trade)18. 

18  There  is  evidence  to  suggest  that  vega-weighted  index  vs  single-stock  pair  trades  on  average 
associate 2%-5% too much weight to the single-stock leg compared to the index leg. However, as this 
is so small compared to stock specific factors, it should be ignored.

6.3: CORRELATION TRADING 

The  volatility  of  an  index  is  capped  at  the  weighted  average  volatility  of  its 
constituents.  Due  to  diversification  (or  less  than  100%  correlation),  the  volatility  of 
indices  tends  to  trade  significantly  less  than  its  constituents.  The  flow  from  both 
institutions  and  structured  products  tends  to  put  upward  pressure  on  implied 
correlation, making index implied volatility expensive. Hedge funds and proprietary 
trading  desks try  to  profit  from this  anomaly  by  either  selling  correlation  swaps,  or 
through dispersion trading (going short index implied volatility and long single stock 
implied volatility). Selling correlation became an unpopular strategy following losses 
during the credit crunch, but demand is now recovering. 

INDEX IMPLIED LESS THAN SINGLE STOCKS 

The  volatility  of  an  index  is  capped  by  the  weighted  average  volatility  of  its  members.  In 
order to show this we shall construct a simple index of two equal weighted members who 
have the same volatility. If the two members are 100% correlated with each other, then the 
volatility  of  the  index  is  equal  to  the  volatility  of  the  members  (as  they  have  the  same 
volatility and weight, this is the same as the weighted average volatility of the constituents).

CHAPTER 6: RELATIVE VALUE AND CORRELATION TRADING 

Volatility of index has floor at zero when there is very low correlation  

If we take a second example of two equal weighted index members with the same volatility, 
but with a negative 100% correlation (ie, as low as possible), then the index is a straight line 
with zero volatility.

Index vol is bounded by zero and weighted average single stock vol 

While the simple examples above have an index with only two members, results for a bigger 
index are identical. Therefore, the equation below is true. While we are currently examining 
historical volatility, the same analysis can be applied to implied volatility. In this way, we can 
get  an  implied  correlation  surface  from  the  implied  volatility  surfaces  of  an  index  and  its 
single-stock  members.  However,  it  is  usually  easiest  to  look  at  variance  swap  levels  rather 
than implied volatility to remove any strike dependency.

INDEX CORRELATION CAN BE ESTIMATED FROM VARIANCE 

If  the  correlation  of  all  the  different  members  of  an  index  is  assumed  to  be  identical  (a 
heroic assumption, but a necessary one if we want to have a single measure of correlation), 
the correlation implied by index and single-stock implied volatility can be estimated as the 
variance of the index divided by the weighted average single-stock variance. This measure is 
a  point  or  two  higher  than  the  actual  implied  correlation  but  is  still  a  reasonable 
approximation.

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS LIFT IMPLIED CORRELATION 

Using correlation to visually cheapen payouts through worst-of/best-of options is common 
practice for structured products. Similarly, the sale of structured products, such as Altiplano 
(which receives a coupon provided none of the assets in the basket has fallen), Everest (payoff on 
the  worst  performing)  and  Himalayas  (performance  of  best  share  of  index),  leave  their 
vendors  short  implied  correlation.  This  buying  pressure  tends  to  lift  implied  correlation 
above  fair  value.  We  estimate  that  the  correlation  exposure  of  investment  banks  totals 
c€200mn  per  percentage  point  of  correlation.  The  above  formulae  can  show  that  two 
correlation points is equivalent to 0.3 to 0.5 (single-stock) volatility points. Similarly, the fact 
that institutional investors tend to call overwrite on single stocks but buy protection on an 
index also leads to buying pressure on implied correlation. The different methods of trading 
correlation are shown below. 

  Dispersion  trading.  Going  short  index  implied  volatility  and  going  long  single-stock 
implied volatility is known as a dispersion trade. As a dispersion trade is short Volga, or 
vol  of  vol,  the  implied  correlation  sold  should  be  c10pts  higher  value  than  for  a 

 
 
 
 
 
6.3: Correlation Trading 

165 

correlation  swap.  A  dispersion  trade  was  historically  put  on  using  variance  swaps,  but 
the  large  losses  from  being  short  single  stock  variance  led  to  the  single  stock  market 
becoming  extinct.  Now  dispersion  is  either  put  on  using  straddles,  or  volatility  swaps. 
Straddles  benefit  from  the  tighter  bid-offer  spreads  of  ATM  options  (variance  swaps 
need  to  trade  a  strip  of  options  of  every  strike).  Using  straddles  does  imply  greater 
maintenance  of  positions,  but  some  firms  offer  delta  hedging  for  5-10bp.  A 
disadvantage of using straddles is that returns are path dependent. For example, if half 
the stocks move up and half move down, then the long single stocks are away from their 
strike and the short index straddle is ATM. 

  Correlation  swaps.  A  correlation  swap  is  simply  a  swap  between  the  (normally  equal 
weighted) average pairwise correlation of all members of an index and a fixed amount 
determined  at  inception.  Market  value-weighted  correlation  swaps  are  c5  correlation 
points  above  equal  weighted  correlation,  as  larger  companies  are  typically  more 
correlated than smaller companies. While using correlation swaps to trade dispersion is 
very simple, the relative lack of liquidity of the product is a disadvantage. We note the 
levels of correlation sold are typically c5pts above realised correlation. 

  Covariance swaps. While correlation swaps are relatively intuitive and are very similar 
to  trading  correlation  via  dispersion,  the  risk  is  not  identical  to  the  covariance  risk  of 
structured  product  sellers  (from  selling  options  on  a  basket).  Covariance  swaps  were 
invented to better hedge the risk on structure books, and they pay out the correlation 
multiplied by the volatility of the two assets. 

  Basket options. Basket options (or options on a basket) are similar to an option on an index, 
except  the  membership  and  weighting  of  the  members  does  not  change  over  time.  The  most 
popular basket option is a basket of two equal weighted members, usually indices. 

  Worst-of/best-of option. The pricing of worst-of and best-of options has a correlation 
component. These products are discussed in the section 5.2 Worst-of/Best-of Options in the 
Forward Starting Products and Light Exotics chapter. 

  Outperformance  options.  Outperformance  options  pricing  has  as  an  input  the 
correlation between the two assets. These products are also discussed in the section 5.3 
Outperformance Options in the Forward Starting Products and Light Exotics chapter. 

 
 
 
166 

CHAPTER 6: RELATIVE VALUE AND CORRELATION TRADING 

Implied correlation of dispersion and level of correlation swap are not the 
same measure 

We note that the profit from theta-weighted (explained later in section) variance dispersion 
is roughly the difference between implied and realised correlation multiplied by the average 
single-stock volatility. As correlation is correlated to volatility, this means the payout when 
correlation is high is increased (as volatility is high) and the payout when correlation is low is 
decreased (as volatility is low). A short correlation position from going long dispersion (short 
index  variance,  long  single-stock  variance)  will  suffer  from  this  as  profits  are  less  than 
expected  and  losses  are  greater.  Dispersion  is  therefore  short  vol  of  vol;  hence,  implied 
correlation tends to  trade  c10  correlation points  more than  correlation  swaps  (which  is  c5 
points above realised correlation). We note this does not necessarily mean a long dispersion 
trade  should  be  profitable  (as  dispersion  is  short  vol  of  vol,  the  fair  price  of  implied 
correlation is above average realised correlation). 

Implied vs realised correlation increases for low levels of correlation 

For  example,  in  normal  market  conditions  the  SX5E  and  S&P500  will  have  an  implied 
correlation of 50-70 and a realised of 30-60. If realised correlation is 30, implied will tend to 
be at least 50 (as investors price in the fact correlation is unlikely to be that low for very long; 
hence, the trade has more downside than upside). The NKY tends to have correlation levels 
ten points below the SX5E and SPX.

DISPERSION MARKET SHRANK POST CREDIT CRUNCH 

Selling  correlation  led  to  severe  losses  when  the  market  collapsed  in  2008,  as  implied 
correlation  spiked  to  c90%,  which  led  many  investors  to  cut  back  exposures  or  leave  the 
market. Similar events occurred in the market during the May 2010 correction. The amount 
of  crossed  vega  has  been  reduced  from  up  to  €100mn  at  some  firms  to  €5-20mn  now 
(crossed  vega  is  the  amount  of  offsetting  single-stock  and  index  vega,  ie,  €10mn  crossed 
vega is €10mn on single stock and €10mn on index). Similarly, the size of trades has declined 
from a peak of €2.5mn to €0.5mn vega now.

CBOE INDICES ALLOW CORRELATION TO BE PLOTTED 

There are now correlation indices for calculating the implied correlation of dispersion trades 
calculated by the CBOE. As there are 500 members of the S&P500, the CBOE calculation 
only takes the top 50 stocks (to ensure liquidity). There are three correlation indices tickers 
(ICJ, JCJ and KCJ), but only two correlation indices are calculated at any one time. On any 
date one correlation index has a maturity up to one year, and another has a maturity between 
one  and  two  years.  The  calculation  uses  December  expiry  for  S&P500  options,  and  the 
following January expiry for the top 50 members as this is the only listed expiry (US single 
stocks  tend  to  be  listed  for  the  month  after  index  triple  witching  expiries).  The  index  is 
calculated until the previous November expiry, as the calculation tends to be very noisy for 
maturities  only  one  month  to  December  index  expiry.  On  the  November  expiry,  the  one 
month  maturity  (to  S&P500  expiry)  index  ceases  calculation,  and  the  previously  dormant 
index starts calculation as a two-year (and one-month) maturity index. For the chart below, 
we use the longest dated available index.

CORRELATION SWAPS HAVE PURE CORRELATION EXPOSURE 

Correlation  swaps  (which,  like  variance  swaps,  are  called  swaps  but  are  actually  forwards) 
simply have a clean payout of the (normally equal-weighted) correlation between every pair 
in  the  basket  less  the  correlation  strike  at  inception.  Correlation  swaps  usually  trade  on  a 
basket, not an index, to remove the names where a structured product has a particularly high 
correlation risk. Half of the underlyings are typically European, a third US and the final sixth 
Asian stocks. The product started trading in 2002 as a means for investment banks to reduce 
their  short  correlation  exposure  from  their  structured  products  books.  While  a  weighted 
pairwise  correlation  would  make  most  sense  for  a  correlation  swap  on  an  index,  the 
calculation is typically equal-weighted as it is normally on a basket. 

Equal-weighted correlation is c5 points below market value-weighted  

Market value-weighted correlation swaps tends to trade c5 correlation points above realised 
correlation (a more sophisticated methodology is below). This level is c10 correlation points 
below the implied correlation of dispersion (as dispersion payout suffers from being short 
volga).  In  addition,  the  correlation  levels  for  equal-weighted  correlations  tends  to  be  c5 
correlation points lower than for market value-weighted, due to the greater weight allocated 
to smaller – and hence less correlated – stocks. The formula for the payout of a correlation 
swap is below.

Correlation swaps tend to trade c5 correlation points above realised 

A  useful  rule  of  thumb  for  the  level  of  a  correlation  swap  is  that  it  trades  c5  correlation 
points above realised correlation (either equal-weighted or market value-weighted, depending 
on the type of correlation swap). However, for very high or very low values of correlation, 
this  formula  makes  less  sense.  Empirically,  smaller  correlations  are  typically  more  volatile 
than higher correlations. Therefore, it makes sense to bump the current realised correlation 
by  a  larger  amount  for  small  correlations  than  for  higher  correlations  (correlation  swaps 
should  trade  above  realised  due  to  demand  from  structured  products).  The  bump  should 
also  tend  to  zero  as  correlation  tends  to  zero,  as  having  a  correlation  swap  above  100% 
would result in arbitrage (can sell correlation swap above 100% as max correlation is 100%). 
Hence, a more accurate rule of thumb (for very high and low correlations) is given by the 
formula below. 

Correlation swap level = ρ + α (1 - ρ) 

where 

ρ   = realised correlation 

α   = bump factor (typical α = 0.1) 

Maturity of correlation swap is typically between one and three years 

Structured  products  typically  have  a  maturity  of  5+  years;  however,  many  investors  close 
their positions before expiry. The fact that a product can also delete a member within the 
lifetime of the product has led dealers to concentrate on the three-year maturity rather than 

  
 
  
 
170 

CHAPTER 6: RELATIVE VALUE AND CORRELATION TRADING 

five-year. As the time horizon of hedge funds is short dated, correlation swaps typically trade 
between one and three years. The size is usually between €250k and €1,000k. 

Correlation swaps suffer from lack of liquidity 

The market for correlation swaps has always been smaller than for dispersion. Whereas the 
variance  swap  or  option  market  has  other  market  participants  who  ensure  liquidity  and 
market visibility, the investor base for correlation swaps is far smaller. This can be an issue 
should  a  position  wish  to  be  closed  before  expiry.  It  can  also  cause  mark-to-market 
problems.  The  correlation  swap  market  grew  from  2002  onwards  until  the  credit  crunch, 
when investor appetite for exotic products disappeared. At its peak, it is estimated that some 
structured derivative houses shed up to c10% of their short correlation risk to hedge funds 
using correlation swaps. 

DISPERSION IS THE MOST POPULAR METHOD OF TRADING 
CORRELATION 

As  the  levels  of  implied  correlation  are  usually  overpriced  (a  side  effect  of  the  short 
correlation position of structured product sellers), index implied volatility is expensive when 
compared  with  the  implied  volatility  of  single  stocks.  A  long  dispersion  trade  attempts  to 
profit from this by selling index implied and going long single-stock implied19. Such a long 
dispersion trade is short implied correlation. While dispersion is the most common method 
of  trading  implied  correlation,  the  payoff  is  also  dependent  on  the  level  of  volatility.  The 
payout  of  (theta-weighted)  dispersion  is  shown  below.  Because  of  this,  and  because 
correlation is correlated to volatility, dispersion trading is short vol of vol (volga).

There are four instruments that can be used to trade dispersion: 

  Straddle  (or  call)  dispersion.  Using  ATM  straddles  to  trade  dispersion  is  the  most 
liquid  and  transparent  way  of  trading.  Because  it  uses  options,  the  simplest  and  most 
liquid  volatility  instrument,  the  pricing  is  usually  the  most  competitive.  Trading  90% 
strike  rather  than  ATM  allows  higher  levels  of  implied  correlation  to  be  sold.  Using 
options is very labour intensive, however, as the position has to be delta-hedged (some 
firms  offer  delta  hedging  for  5-10bp).  In  addition,  the  changing  vega  of  the  positions 
needs to be monitored, as the risks are high given the large number of options that have 
to be traded. In a worst-case scenario, an investor could be right about the correlation 
position  but  suffer  a  loss  from  lack  of  vega  monitoring.  We  believe  that  using  OTM 
strangles  rather  than  straddles  is  a  better  method  of  using  vanilla  options  to  trade 
dispersion  as  OTM strangles  have  a  flatter  vega  profile.  This  means  that spot  moving 

19 Less liquid members of an index are often excluded, eg, CRH for the Euro STOXX 50. 

 
 
                                                      
6.3: Correlation Trading 

171 

away from strike is less of an issue, but we acknowledge that this is a less practical way 
of trading. 

  Variance  swap  dispersion.  Because  of  the  overhead  of  developing  risk  management 
and  trading  infrastructure  for  straddle  dispersion,  many  hedge  funds  preferred  to  use 
variance swaps to trade dispersion. With variance dispersion it is easier to see the profits 
(or  losses)  from  trading  correlation than  it  is  for  straddles.  Variance  dispersion  suffers 
from the disadvantage that not all the members of an index will have a liquid variance 
swap  market.  Since  2008,  the  single-stock  variance  market  has  disappeared  due  to  the 
large losses suffered from single-stock variance sellers (as dispersion traders want to go 
long  single-stock  variance,  trading  desks  were  predominantly  short  single-stock 
variance). It is now rare to be able to trade dispersion through variance swaps. 

  Volatility swap dispersion.  Since liquidity disappeared from the single-stock variance 
market,  investment  banks  have  started  to  offer  volatility  swap  dispersion  as  an 
alternative. Excluding dispersion trades, volatility swaps rarely trade. 

  Gamma  swap  dispersion.  Trading  dispersion  via  gamma  swaps  is  the  only  ‘fire  and 
forget’ way of trading dispersion. As a member of an index declines, the impact on the 
index volatility declines. As a gamma swap weights the variance payout on each day by 
the closing price on that day, the payout of a gamma swap similarly declines with spot. 
For all other dispersion trades, the volatility exposure has to be reduced for stocks that 
decline and increased for stocks that rise. Despite the efforts of some investment banks, 
gamma swaps never gained significant popularity. 

Need to decide on weighting scheme for dispersion trades 

While a dispersion trade always involves a short index volatility position and a long single-
stock volatility position, there are different strategies for calculating the ratio of the two trade 
legs. If we assume index implied is initially 20%, if it increases to 30% the market could be 
considered to have risen by ten volatility points or risen by 50%. If the market is considered 
to rise by ten volatility points and average single-stock implied is 25%, it would be expected 
to  rise  to  50%  (vega-weighted).  If  the  market  is  considered  to  rise  by  50%  and  average 
single-stock  implied  is  30%,  it  would  be  expected  to  rise  to  45%  (theta-  or  correlation-
weighted). The third weighting, gamma-weighted, is not often used in practice. 

  Vega-weighted.  In a vega-weighted dispersion, the index vega is equal to the sum of 
the  single-stock  vega.  If  both  index  and  single-stock  vega  rise  one  volatility  point,  the 
two legs cancel and the trade neither suffers a loss or reveals a profit. 

  Theta-  (or  correlation-)  weighted.  Theta  weighting  means  the  vega  multiplied  by 
√variance (or volatility for volatility swaps) is equal on both legs. This means there is a 
smaller single-stock vega leg than for vega weighting (as single-stock volatility is larger 
than  index  volatility,  so  it  must  have  a  smaller  vega  for  vega  ×  volatility  to  be  equal). 
Under theta-weighted dispersion, if all securities have zero volatility, the theta of both 

 
172 

CHAPTER 6: RELATIVE VALUE AND CORRELATION TRADING 

the long and short legs cancels (and total theta is therefore zero). Theta weighting can be 
thought of as correlation-weighted (as correlation ≈ index var / average single stock var 
= ratio of single-stock vega to index vega). If volatility rises 1% (relative move) the two 
legs cancel and the dispersion breaks even. 

  Gamma-weighted.  Gamma  weighting  is  the  least  common  of  the  three  types  of 
dispersion. As gamma is proportional to vega/vol, then the vega/vol of both legs must 
be equal. As single-stock vol is larger than index vol, there is a larger single-stock vega 
leg than for vega-weighted. 

Greeks of dispersion trading depend on weighting used 

The Greeks of a dispersion trade20 are very much dependent on the vega weighting of the 
two  legs.  The  easiest  weighting  to  understand  is  a  vega-weighted  dispersion,  which  by 
definition  has  zero  vega  (as  the  vega  of  the  short  index  and  long  single-stock  legs  are 
identical). A vega-weighted dispersion is, however, short gamma and short theta (ie, have to 
pay theta). 

Theta-weighted  dispersion  needs  a  smaller  long  single-stock  leg  than  the  index  leg  (as 
reducing the long position reduces theta paid on the long single-stock leg to that of the theta 
earned  on  the  short  index  leg).  As  the  long  single-stock  leg  is  smaller,  a  theta-weighted 
dispersion is very short gamma (as it has less gamma than vega-weighted, and vega-weighted 
is short gamma). 

Gamma-weighted  dispersion  needs  a  larger  long  single-stock  leg  than  the  index  leg  (as 
increasing the long position increases the gamma to that of the short index gamma). As the 
long single-stock leg is larger, the theta paid is higher than that for vega-weighted.

DISPERSION CAN BE THETA, VEGA AND GAMMA-WEIGHTED

weighted dispersion. The change in volatility for the different trades to break even is shown. 
As  can  be  seen,  only  theta-weighted  dispersion  gives  correlation  exposure  (ie,  if  realised

CHAPTER 6: RELATIVE VALUE AND CORRELATION TRADING 

Theta-weighted dispersion is best weighting for almost pure correlation 
exposure 

The  sole  factor  that  determines  if  theta-weighted  dispersion  makes  a  profit  or  loss  is  the 
difference  between  realised  and  implied  correlation.  For  timing  entry  points  for  theta-
weighted dispersion, we believe investors should look at the implied correlation of an index 
(as  theta-weighted  dispersion  returns  are  driven  by  correlation).  Note  that  theta-weighted 
dispersion  breaks  even  if  single  stock  and  index  implied  moves  by  the  same  percentage 
amount  (eg,  index  vol  of  20%,  single-stock  vol  of  25%  and  both  rise  50%  to  30%  and 
37.5%, respectively). 

Vega-weighted dispersion gives hedged exposure to mispricing of correlation 

When a dispersion trade is vega-weighted, it can be thought of as being the sum of a theta-
weighted  dispersion  (which  gives  correlation  exposure),  plus  a  long  single-stock  volatility 
position. This volatility exposure can be thought of as a hedge against the short correlation 
position (as volatility and correlation are correlated); hence, a vega-weighted dispersion gives 
greater exposure to the mispricing of correlation. When looking at the optimal entry point 
for  vega-weighted  dispersion,  it  is  better  to  look  at  the  difference  between  average  single-
stock volatility and index volatility (as this applies an equal weight to both legs, like in a vega-
weighted  dispersion).  Note  that  vega-weighted  dispersion  breaks  even  if  single  stock  and 
index implied moves by the same absolute amount (eg, index vol of 20%, single-stock vol of 
25%  and  both  rise  ten  volatility  points  to  30%  and  35%,  respectively).  Empirically,  the 
difference  between  single-stock  and  index  volatility  (ie,  vega-weighted  dispersion)  is  not 
correlated  to  volatility21,  which  supports  our  view  of  vega-weighted  dispersion  being  the 
best. 

Gamma-weighted dispersion is rare, and not recommended 

While  gamma  weighting  might  appear  mathematically  to  be  a  suitable  weighting  for 
dispersion, in practice it is rarely used. It seems difficult to justify a weighting scheme where 
more  single-stock  vega  is  bought  than  index  (as  single  stocks  have  a  higher  implied  than 
index and, hence, should move more). We include the details of this weighting scheme for 
completeness, but do not recommend it. 

21  Single-stock  leg  is  arguably  2%-5%  too  large;  however,  slightly  over-hedging  the  implicit  short 
volatility position of dispersion could be seen as an advantage.

DISPERSION TRADES ARE SHORT VOL OF VOL (VOLGA) 

The P&L of a theta-weighted dispersion trade is proportional to the spread between implied 
and realized market value-weighted correlation (ρ), multiplied by a factor that corresponds to 
a weighted average variance of the components of the index22.

ρ = market value weighted correlation 

The payout of a theta-weighted dispersion is therefore equal to the difference in implied and 
realised  correlation  (market  value-weighted  pairwise  realised  correlation)  multiplied  by  the 
weighted  average  variance.  If  vol  of  vol  was  zero  and  volatility  did  not  change,  then  the 
payout would be identical to a correlation swap and both should have the same correlation 
price.  If  volatility  is  assumed  to  be  correlated to  correlation  (as  it  is,  as both  volatility  and 
correlation increase in a downturn) and the correlation component is profitable, the profits 
are reduced (as it is multiplied by a lower volatility). Similarly, if the correlation suffers a loss, 
the  losses  are  magnified  (as  it  is  multiplied  by  a  higher  volatility).  Dispersion  is  therefore 
short  volga  (vol  of  vol)  as  the  greater  the  change  in  volatility,  the  worse  the  payout.  To 
compensate for this short volga position, the implied correlation level of dispersion is c10 
correlation points above the level of correlation swaps. 

BASKET OPTIONS ARE MOST LIQUID CORRELATION PRODUCT 

The most common product for trading correlation is a basket option (otherwise known as an 
option on a basket). If the members of a basket are identical to the members of an index and 
have identical weights, then the basket option is virtually identical to an option on the index. 
The two are not completely identical, as the membership and weight of a basket option does 
not  change23,  but  it  can  for  an  index  (due  to membership  changes,  rights  issues,  etc).  The 
formula for basket options is below.

CHAPTER 6: RELATIVE VALUE AND CORRELATION TRADING 

MOST POPULAR BASKET OPTIONS ARE ON TWO INDICES 

While the above formula can be used for all types of basket, the most popular is a basket on 
two  equal  weighted  indices.  In  this  case  the  correlation  traded  is  not  between  multiple 
members of a basket (or index) but the correlation between only two indices. As the options 
usually wants the two indices to have identical value, it is easier to define the basket as the 
equal weighted sum of the two security returns (see the below formula setting n = 2). The 
previous  formula  could  be  used,  but  the  weight  w  would  not  be  0.5  (would  be  0.5  /  Si  at 
inception).

PAYOFF IS BASED ON COVARIANCE, NOT CORRELATION 

The payout of basket options is based on the correlation multiplied by the volatility of the 
two securities, which is known as covariance. The formula for covariance is shown below. 
As  basket  options  are  typically  the  payout  of structured  products,  it  is  better  to  hedge  the 
exposure using products whose payout is also based on covariance. It is therefore better to 
use  covariance  swaps  rather  than  correlation  swaps  or  dispersion  to  offset  structured 
product risk. 

Covariance(A,B) = 

BAσρσ  where ρ is the correlation between A and B 

COVARIANCE SWAPS BETTER REPRESENT STRUCTURED 
PRODUCT RISK 

The  payout  of  structured  products  is  often  based  on  a  basket  option.  The  pricing  of  an 
option  on  a  basket  involves  covariance,  not  correlation.  If  an  investment  bank  sells  an 
option  on  a  basket  to  a  customer  and  hedges  through  buying  correlation  (via  correlation 
swaps or dispersion) there is a mismatch24. Because of this, attempts were made to create a 
covariance swap market, but liquidity never took off.

6.4: TRADING EARNINGS 

ANNOUNCEMENTS/JUMPS 

From  the  implied  volatilities  of  near  dated  options,  it  is  possible  to  calculate  the 
implied  jump  on  key  dates.  Trading  these  options  in  order  to  take  a  view  on  the 
likelihood  of  unanticipated  (low  or  high)  volatility  on  reporting  dates  is  a  very 
common  strategy.  We  examine  the  different  methods  of  calculating  the  implied 
jump, and show how the jump calculation should normalise for index term structure. 

TOTAL VOL = DIFFUSIVE VOL + JUMP VOL 

While  stock  prices  under  Black-Scholes  are  modelled  as  having  a  GBM  (Geometric 
Brownian  Motion)  with  constant  volatility,  in  reality  there  are  certain  dates  where  there  is 
likely  to  be  more  volatility  than  average.  These  key  dates  are  usually  reporting  dates,  but 
could also coincide with conference dates or investor days (in fact, any day where material 
non-public information is released to the public). The implied volatility of an option whose 
expiry is after a key date can be considered to be the sum of the normal diffusive volatility 
(normal volatility for the stock in the absence of any significantly material information being 
released) and the volatility due to the anticipated jump on the key date. While options of any 
expiry after the key date could be used, we shall assume the expiry chosen is the expiry just 
after the key date (to ensure the greatest percentage of the options’ time value is associated 
with the jump).  

Implied jumps can be traded as part of a relative value trade 

Trading  an  option  whose  expiry  is  just  after  the  key  date  gives  exposure  not  only  to  the 
implied  jump,  but  also  the  normal  diffusive  volatility.  If  the  expiry  is  far  away  then  there 
should be another expiry just before the key date. In this case the long position in the expiry 
just after the key date can  be hedged by shorting the expiry just before the key date. This 
relative value trade assumes the investor wishes to be long the implied volatility jump. If an 
investor wishes to short an expensive implied volatility jump then the reverse position (short

ESTIMATING DIFFUSIVE VOLATILITY IS NOT TRIVIAL 

In order to calculate the implied jump due to a key date, the diffusive (normal) volatility of 
the stock needs to be estimated. While the diffusive volatility could be estimated by looking 
at historical volatility, it is usual to look at implied volatility (as there are several measures of 
historical  volatility,  but  only  one  implied  volatility).  If  there  is  an  option  that  expires  just 
before the key date, then the implied volatility of this option can be used. If not, the forward 
volatility after the key date is used as the estimate for the normal volatility of the security.

CHAPTER 6: RELATIVE VALUE AND CORRELATION TRADING 

Implied jumps normally calculated for near-dated events 

Implied jumps are normally only calculated for near-dated events, as the effect of the jump 
tends to be too diluted for far dated expiries (and hence would be untradeable taking bid-
offer spreads into account). Forward starting options could be used to trade jumps after the 
first expiry, but the wider bid-offer spread could be greater than potential profits. 

Forward volatility can be calculated with implied of two options 

The  calculation  for  forward  volatility  is  derived  from  the  fact  variance  (time  weighted)  is 
additive. The formula is given below (σx is the implied volatility for options of maturity Tx).

JUMP VOLATILITY CAN BE CALCULATED FROM DIFFUSIVE

As  variance  is  additive,  the  volatility  due  to  the  jump  can  be  calculated  from  the  total 
volatility and the diffusive volatility. We note this assumes the normal diffusive volatility is 
constant, whereas volatility just after a reporting date is, in fact, typically ¾ of the volatility 
just before a reporting date (as the previously uncertain earnings are now known).

EQUITY JUMP ASSUMES FLAT TERM STRUCTURE 

The  methodology  for  extracting  jumps  from  the  difference  between  the  front-month 
implieds  is  simply  a  case  of  mathematics,  assuming  the  volatility  of  a  stock  is  equal  to  a 
‘normal’ volatility on every day plus an ‘abnormal’ jump on reporting. In order to calculate 
the  ‘abnormal’  jump,  we  need  to  estimate  the  ‘normal’  volatility,  and  this  estimate  usually 
requires a flat term structure to be assumed.

Adjusting for index term structure removes macro effects 

Single stock term structure is the sum of index (or macro) term structure and the impact of 
the  jump  on  reporting.  If  the  index  term  structure  is  used  to  adjust  the  single-stock  term 
structure, then a more accurate implied jump can be calculated  25(assuming the single-stock 
term structure would be identical to index term structure without the effect of a reporting 
date). For simplicity, the diagrams below assume reporting is between expiry 2 and 3, but the 
effect will be similar if earnings is between expiry 1 and 2.

SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

We  examine  how  skew  and  term  structure  are  linked  and  the  effect  on  volatility 
surfaces of the square root of time rule. The correct way to measure skew and smile is 
examined, and we show how skew trades only breakeven when there is a static local 
volatility surface.

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

7.1: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE ARE LINKED 

When there is an equity market decline, there is normally a larger increase in ATM 
implied  volatility  at  the  near  end  of  volatility  surfaces  than  the  far  end.  Assuming 
sticky  strike,  this  causes  near-dated  skew  to  be  larger  than  far-dated  skew.  The 
greater  the  term  structure  change  for  a  given  change  in  spot,  the  higher  skew  is. 
Skew is also positively correlated to term structure (this relationship can break down 
in  panicked  markets).  For  an  index,  skew  (and  potentially  term  structure)  is  also 
lifted by the implied correlation surface. Diverse indices tend to have higher skew for 
this reason, as the ATM correlation is lower (and low strike correlation tends to 100% 
for all indices). 

SKEW & TERM STR CUT SURFACE IN DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS 

A  volatility  surface  has  three  dimensions  (strike,  expiry  and  implied  volatility),  which  is 
difficult  to  show  on  a  two  dimensional  page.  For  simplicity,  a  volatility  surface  is  often 
plotted as two separate two dimensional graphs. The first plots implied volatility vs expiry 
(similar to the way in which a yield curve plots credit spread against expiry) in order to show 
term structure (the difference in implied volatility for options with different maturities and 
the same strike). The second plots implied volatility vs strike to show skew (the difference in 
implied  volatility  for  options  with  different  strikes  and  the  same  maturity).  We  examine  a 
volatility  surface  in  both  these  ways  (ie,  term  structure  and  skew)  and  show  how  they  are 
related. 

TERM STRUCTURE IS NORMALLY UPWARD SLOPING 

When there is a spike in realised volatility, near-dated implied volatility tends to spike in a 
similar way (unless the spike is due to a specific event such as earnings). This is because the 
high  realised  volatility  is  expected  to  continue  in  the  short  term.  Realised  volatility  can  be 
expected  to  mean  revert  over  a  c8-month  period,  on  average.  Hence  far-dated  implied 
volatilities  tend  to  rise  by  a  smaller  amount  than  near-dated  implied  volatilities  (as  the 
increased volatility of the underlying will only last a fraction of the life of a far-dated option). 
Near-dated implieds are therefore more volatile than far-dated implieds. The theoretical term 
structure  for  different  strikes  is  shown  in  Figure  98  below,  which  demonstrates  that  near-
dated  implieds  are  more  volatile.  We  have  shown  ATM  (100%)  term  structure  as  upward 
sloping as this is how it trades on average (for the same reasons credit spread term structure 
is  normally  upward  sloping,  ie,  risk  aversion  and  supply-demand  imbalances  for  long 
maturities).

If equity markets decline, term structure becomes inverted 

Typically,  an  increase  in  volatility  tends  to  be  accompanied  by  a decline  in  equity markets, 
while a decline in volatility tends to occur in periods of calm or rising markets. If volatility 
surfaces are assumed not to move as spot moves (ie, sticky strike), then this explains why the 
term  structure  of  low  strike  implied  volatility  is  normally  downward  sloping  (as  the  80% 
strike term structure will be the ATM term structure when equities fall 20%). Similarly, this 
explains why the  term structure of high strike implieds is normally upward sloping (as the 
120% strike term structure will become the ATM term structure when equities rise 20%). 

Slope of rising term structure is shallower than slope of inverted term 
structure 

While Figure 98 above shows the term structure of a theoretical volatility surface, in practice 
the slope of rising term structure is shallower than the slope of inverted term structure. This 
can be seen by looking at a volatility cone (Figure 99). 

Despite the fact that the inverted term structure is steeper, the more frequent case of upward 
sloping term structure means the average term structure is slightly upward sloping26.  

26 Positive implied correlation term structure will also lift index term structure relative to single stock.

Implied volatility is usually greater than realised volatility and less volatile 

While historic and realised volatility are linked, there are important differences which can be 
seen when looking at empirical volatility cones. Average implied volatility lies slightly above 
average realised volatility, as implieds are on average slightly expensive. Implied volatility is 
also  less  volatile  (it  has  a  smaller  min-max  range)  than  realised  volatility  for  near-dated 
maturities. This is because implieds are forward looking (ie, similar to an average of possible 
outcomes)  and  there  is  never  100%  probability  of  the  maximum  or  minimum  possible 
realised.  This  effect  fades  for  longer  maturities,  potentially  due  to  the  additional  volatility 
caused by supply-demand imbalances (eg, varying demand for put protection). This causes 
inverted  implied  volatility  term  structure  to  be  less  steep  than  realised  volatility  term 
structure.  

 
 
 
 
 
7.1: Skew and Term Structure Are Linked 

187 

SKEW IS INVERTED & LARGEST FOR NEAR-DATED EXPIRIES  

Assuming  volatility  surfaces  stay  constant  (ie,  sticky  strike),  the  effect  of  near-dated  ATM 
implieds  moving  further  than  far-dated  implieds  for  a  given  change  in  spot  is  priced  into 
volatility surfaces by having a larger near-dated skew. The example data given in Figure 98 is 
plotted  in  Figure  100  below  with  a  change  of  axes  to  show  skew  for  options  of  different 
maturity.  This  graph  shows  that  near-dated  implieds  have  higher  skew  than  far-dated 
implieds. The more term structure changes for a given change in spot, the steeper skew is. 
As  near-dated  ATM  volatility  is  more  volatile  than  far-dated  ATM  volatility,  near-dated 
implied volatility has higher skew.

Skew for equities is normally inverted 

Unless there is a high likelihood of a significant jump upwards (eg, if there were a potential 
takeover event), equities normally have negative skew (low strike implied greater than high 
strike  implied).  There  are  many  possible  explanations  for  this,  some  of  which  are  listed 
below. 

  Big jumps in spot tend to be down, rather than up. If there is a jump in the stock 
price, this is normally downwards as it is more common for an unexpectedly bad event 
to occur (bankruptcy, tsunami, terrorist attack, accident, loss or death of key personnel, 
etc)  than  an  unexpectedly  good  event  to  occur  (positive  drivers  are  normally  planned 
for). 

 
 
 
 
188 

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

  Volatility  is  a  measure  of  risk  and  leverage  (hence  risk)  increases  as  equities 
decline. If we assume no change in the number of shares in issue or amount of debt, 
then  as  a  company’s  stock  price  declines  its  leverage  (debt/equity)  increases.  Both 
leverage and volatility are a measure of risk and, hence, they are correlated, with volatility 
rising as equities fall. 

  Demand  for  protection  and  call  overwriting.  Typically,  investors  are  interested  in 
buying  puts  for  protection,  rather  than  selling  them.  This  lifts  low  strike  implieds. 
Additionally,  some  investors  like  to  call  overwrite  their  positions,  which  weighs  on 
higher strike implieds. 

REASONS WHY SKEW & TERM STR ARE CORRELATED 

The correlation between skew and term structure is shown below. The diagram only shows 
data for positive term structure, as the relationship tends to break down during a crisis.

There are three reasons why skew and term structure are correlated 

  Credit events, such as bankruptcy, lift both skew and term structure 

  Implied volatility is ‘sticky’ for low strikes and long maturities 

  Implied correlation is ‘sticky’ for low strikes and long maturities (only applies to index) 

(1)  BANKRUPTCY LIFTS BOTH SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE 

There are various models that show the effect of bankruptcy (or credit risk) lifting both skew 
and term structure. As implieds with lower strikes have a greater sensitivity to credit risk (as 
most  of  the  value  of  low  strike  puts  is  due  to  the  risk  of  bankruptcy),  their  implieds  rise 
more, which causes higher skew. Similarly, options with longer maturity are more sensitive to 
credit  risk  (causing  higher  term  structure,  as  far-dated  implieds  rise  more).  Longer-dated 
options have a higher sensitivity to credit risk as the probability of entering default increases 
with  time  (hence  a  greater  proportion  of  an  option’s  value  will  be  associated  with  credit 
events  as  maturity  increases).  More  detail  on  the  link  between  volatility  and  credit  can  be 
seen in section A12 capital Structure Arbitrage in the Appendix. 

(2)  IMPLIED VOL IS ‘STICKY’ FOR LOW STRIKES AND LONG MATURITIES 

Term structure should rise if near-dated ATM implieds fall, as far-dated ATM implieds are 
relatively  constant  (as  they  tend  to  include  complete  economic  cycles).  This  is  shown 
in Figure 102 below.

Skew tends to rise as ATM implieds fall as low strike implieds are ‘sticky’ 

If there is a sudden decline in equity markets, it is reasonable to assume realised volatility will 
jump to a level in line with the peak of realised volatility. Therefore, low-strike, near-dated 
implieds should be relatively constant (as they should trade near the all-time highs of realised 
volatility). If a low-strike implied is constant, the difference between a low-strike implied and 
ATM  implied  increases  as  ATM  implieds  falls.  This  means  near-dated  skew  should  rise  if 
near-dated ATM implieds decline (see Figure 103 above).  

Term structure & skew are correlated as both rise as implied volatility falls 

A decline in near dated ATM implied volatility lifts term structure and skew as low strike and 
long  maturity  implied  volatility  is  ‘sticky’.  Hence  skew  and  term  structure  should  be 
correlated as a fall in near-dated ATM implied lifts both of them. 

Skew is often mistakenly used as a risk indicator 

We do not view skew as a  reliable risk indicator, as it can be inversely correlated to ATM 
volatility27.  The  effect  of falling  implieds  causing  an  increase  in  90%-100% skew  is shown 
with  empirical  data  in  Figure  104  below  (many  investors  prefer  to  use  90%-100%  skew 
rather than 90%-110%, as upside 100%-110% skew flattens as implieds reach a bottom).

(3)  CORRELATION  SURFACE  CAUSES  INDEX  SKEW  AND  TERM  STRUCTURE 

TO BE CORRELATED 

27 ATM volatility is a risk measure; hence, a measure often inversely correlated to ATM volatility, such 
as skew, is not a reliable risk measure.

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

In the same way implied volatility is ‘sticky’ for low strikes and long maturities, so is implied 
correlation (in a crisis correlation tends to 100% hence low strike correlation is ‘sticky’, and 
in  the  long  run  macro  trends  are  the  primary  driver  for  all  stock  prices  hence  long  dated 
correlation is also ‘sticky’). This can be an additional reason why index skew and index term 
structure are correlated. 

CORRELATION LIFTS INDEX SKEW ABOVE SINGLE-STOCK SKEW 

An  approximation  for  implied  correlation  is  the  index  volatility  squared  divided  by  the 
average single-stock volatility squared [ρ = σIndex² ÷ average(σSingle  stock)²]. Implied correlation 
is assumed to tend towards 100% for low strikes, as all stocks can be expected to decline in a 
crisis.  This  causes  index  skew  to  be  greater  than  single  stock  skew.  Index  skew  can  be 
thought of as being caused by both the skew of the single stock implied volatility surface, 
and the skew of the implied correlation surface. 

Example of how index skew can be positive with flat single-stock skew 

We  shall  assume  all  single  stocks  in  an  index  have  the  same  (flat)  implied  volatility  and 
single-stock  skew  is  flat.  Low  strike  index  volatility  will  be  roughly  equal  to  the  constant 
single-stock volatility (as implied correlation is close to 100%), but ATM index volatility will 
be less than this value due to diversification (as implied correlation ρ for ATM strikes is less 
than 100% and σIndex² = ρ × average(σSingle  stock)². Despite single stocks having no skew, the 
index has a skew (as low strike index implieds > ATM index implieds) due to the change in 
correlation. For this reason, index skew is always greater than the average single-stock skew. 

Implied correlation is likely to be sticky for low strikes and long maturities 

A  correlation  surface  can  be  constructed  for  options  of  all  strikes  and  expiries,  and  this 
surface is likely to be close to 100% for very low strikes. The surface is likely to be relatively 
constant  for  far  maturities;  hence,  implied  correlation  term  structure  and  skew  will  be 
correlated (as both rise when near-dated ATM implied correlation falls, similar to volatility 
surfaces). This also causes skew and term structure to be correlated for indices. 

DIVERSE INDICES HAVE HIGHER SKEW  

As  index  skew  is  caused  by  both  single-stock  skew  and  implied  correlation  skew,  a  more 
diverse  index  should  have  a  higher  skew  than  a  less  diverse  index  (assuming  there  is  no 
significant difference in the skew of the single-stock members). This is due to the fact that 
diverse indices have a lower ATM implied, but low strike implieds are in line with (higher) 
average single-stock implieds for both diverse and non-diverse indices. 

 
 
7.2: √Root of Time Rule Can Compare Different Term Structures and Skews 

193 

7.2: SQUARE ROOT OF TIME RULE CAN COMPARE 
DIFFERENT TERM STRUCTURES AND SKEWS 

When  implied  volatility  changes,  the  change  in  ATM  volatility  multiplied  by  the 
square  root  of  time  is  generally  constant.  This  means  that  different  (T2-T1)  term 
structures  can  be  compared  when  multiplied  by  √(T2T1)/(√T2-√T1),  as  this 
normalises against 1Y-3M term structure. Skew weighted by the square root of time 
should  also  be  constant.  Looking  at  the  different  term  structures  and  skews,  when 
normalised by the appropriate weighting, can allow us to identify calendar and skew 
trades  in  addition  to  highlighting  which  strike  and  expiry  is  the  most  attractive  to 
buy (or sell). 

REALISED VOLATILITY MEAN REVERTS AFTER 8 MONTHS 

When there is a spike in realised volatility, it takes on average eight months for three-month 
realised  volatility  to  settle  back  down  to  levels  seen  before  the  spike.  The  time  taken  for 
volatility to normalise is generally longer if the volatility is caused by a negative return, than if 
it is caused by a positive return (as a negative return is more likely to be associated with an 
event  that  increases  uncertainty  than  a  positive  return).  This  mean  reversion  is  often 
modelled via the square root of time rule. 

VOL MOVE MULTIPLIED BY √TIME IS USUALLY CONSTANT 

The  near-dated  end  of  volatility  surfaces  is  highly  correlated  to realised  volatility, as  hedge 
funds  and  prop  desks  typically  initiate  long/short  gamma  positions  should  there  be  a 
significant  divergence.  As  volatility  mean  reverts,  the  far-dated  end  of  volatility  surfaces  is 
more stable (as investors know that any spike in volatility will be short-lived and not last for 
the full length of a far-dated option). A common way to model the movement of volatility 
surfaces, is to define the movement of one-year implied and then adjust the rest of the curve 
by that move divided by time (in years) to the power of p. Only two parameters (the one-
year move and p) are needed to adjust the whole surface. Fixing the power (or p) at 0.5 is the 
most common and is known as the square root of time rule (which only has one parameter, 
the one-year change).

Square root of time rule has power 0.5, parallel moves are power 0 

While the above method is usually used with power 0.5 (square root of time rule), any power 
can  be  used.  If  there  is  a  parallel  movement  in  volatility  surfaces  (all  maturities  move  the 
same  amount),  then  a  power  of  0  should  be  used.  In  practice,  implied  volatility  tends  to 
move  with  power  0.44,  suggesting  that  surfaces  move  primarily  in  a  square  root  of  time 
manner  but  at  times  also  in  parallel.  If  implieds  rise  (or  decline)  in  a  square  root  of  time 
manner when equities decline (or rise), then this causes skew to decay by the square root of 
time as well (assuming sticky strike). This means that the skews of different maturities can be 
compared with each other by simply multiplying the skew by the square root of the maturity 
(see Figure 104 below).

POSITIVE PUT/CALL SPREADS IMPLY √TIME RULE FOR SKEW 

Structures such as put spreads or call spreads, which can only have a positive payout, must 
have a cost associated with them, or investors would simply purchase an infinite amount of 
them for zero cost (or small profit) and enter a position which could never suffer a loss. This 
means  that  when  the  strike  of  a  put  is  increased,  its  premium  must  rise  too  (intuitively 
correct, as the strike is the amount of money you receive when you ‘put’ the stock, so the 
higher the strike the better). Conversely, as the strike of a call increases, its premium must 
decrease. It can be shown that enforcing positive put/call spreads puts a cap/floor on skew, 
which  decays  by  the  square  root  of  time.  This  provides  mathematical  support  for  the 
empirical evidence, suggesting implied volatility should normally move in a power weighted 
(by square root of time) manner28. For more details, see the section A6 Modelling Volatility 
Surfaces in the Appendix.

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

√TIME RULE CAN COMPARE DIFFERENT TERM STRUCTURES 

ATM term structure can be modelled as flat volatility, with a square root of time adjustment 
on  top.  With  this  model,  flat  volatility  is  equal  to  the  volatility  for  an  option  of  infinite 
maturity.  There  are,  therefore,  two  parameters  to  this  model,  the  volatility  at  infinity  (V∞) 
and the scale of the square root of time adjustment ,which we define to be z (for one-year 
implied). 

Volatility = V∞ – z /√T 

where z = scale of the square root of time adjustment (which we define as normalised term 
structure) 

We have a negative sign in front of z, so that a positive z implies an upward sloping term 
structure and a negative z is a downward sloping term structure. 

Different term structures are normalised by multiplying by √(T2T1)/(√T2-√T1) 

Using  the  above  definition,  we  can  calculate  the  normalised  term  structure  z  from  two 
volatility points V1 and V2 (whose maturity is T1 and T2). 

V1 = V∞ – z /√T1  

V2 = V∞ – z /√T2  

V1 + z /√T1 = V2 + z /√T2 = V∞ 

z (1/√T1 – 1/√T2) = V2 – V1 

z = (V2 – V1) × 

TT

−

V2 – V1 is the normal definition for term structure. Hence, term structure can be normalised 
by  multiplying  by  √(T2T1)/(√T2-√T1).  We  note  that  the  normalisation  factor  for  1Y-3M 
term structure is 1. Therefore, normalising allows all term structure to be compared to 1Y-
3M term structure.

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

7.3: TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

The  supply-demand  imbalances  of  different  products  on  implied  volatility  surfaces 
can create opportunity for other investors. The degree of the imbalance depends on 
the popularity of the product at the time. Investors who are willing to take the other 
side of the trade should be able to profit from the imbalance, and the risk taken can 
be hedged with other maturities or related securities. 

TERM STRUCTURE TRADES CAN PROFIT FROM IMBALANCES 

The graph below shows the imbalances of the different products by maturity for both single 
stock  and  index.  The  demand  for  long  dated  hedges  typically  lifts  term  structure,  an 
imbalance that an investor can profit from by selling term structure.

CALENDARS CONSTANT IF SURFACES FOLLOW √TIME RULE 

Given that the square root of time appears in the Black-Scholes formula for premium, the 
price  of  a  1x1  calendar  (long  one  far-dated  option,  short  one  near-dated  option)  remains 
approximately constant if implied volatility surfaces move in a square root of time manner. 
Calendars can therefore be used to trade term structure imbalances as the trade is indifferent 
to the level of volatility as long as volatility moves in a power weighted manner. 

 
 
 
7.3: Term Structure Trading 

199 

IDENTIFYING WHEN TO GO LONG, OR SHORT, CALENDARS 

When examining term structure trades, the power of the movement in volatility surfaces can 
be compared to the expected 0.5 power of the square root of time rule. If the movement has 
a  power  significantly  different  from  0.5,  then  a  long  (or  short)  calendar  position  could  be 
initiated  to  profit  from  the  anticipated  correction.  This  method  assumes  calendars  were 
previously fairly priced (otherwise the move could simply be a mean reversion to the norm). 

If vol rises with power less than 0.5, investors should short calendars 

If surfaces rise with a power less than 0.5 (ie, a more parallel move) then near-dated implieds 
have not risen as much as expected and a short calendar (long near-dated, short far-dated) 
position should be initiated. This position will profit from the anticipated correction. Should 
surfaces  fall  with  a  power  less  than  0.5,  a  long  calendar  (short  near-dated,  long  far-dated) 
would profit from the anticipated further decline of near-dated implieds. 

If vol rises with power more than 0.5, investors should go long calendars 

Conversely, if surfaces rise with a power greater than 0.5, near-dated implieds have risen too 
far and a long calendar position should be initiated. On the other hand, if surfaces fall with a 
power greater than 0.5, a short calendar position should be initiated (as near-dated implieds 
have fallen too far). 

POWER VEGA IS VEGA DIVIDED BY THE √TIME 

As  volatility surfaces  tend  to  move  in  a square root  of  time  manner,  many systems  report 
power  vega  (vega  divided  by  square  root  of  time).  Power  vega  takes  into  account  the  fact 
that the implied volatility of near-dated options is more volatile than far-dated options. 

VARIANCE TERM STRUCTURE CAN INDENTIFY TRADES 

To determine if a term structure trade is needed, we could look at variance term structure 
rather  than  implied  volatility  term  structure.  Using  variance  term  structure  eliminates  the 
need to choose a strike (an ATM term structure will not be ATM as soon as the spot moves, 
so  it  is  effectively  strike  dependent,  but  simply  delegates  the  choice of strike  to the  equity 
market).  Variance  term  structure  is  similar  to  ATM  term  structure,  despite  variance  being 
long skew and skew being greater for near-dated implieds. This is because the time value of 
an OTM option increases with maturity. Hence, the increased weight associated with OTM 
options cancels the effect of smaller skew for longer maturities. 

 
200 

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

Forward starting var swaps (or options) can be used to trade term structure 

Trading  term  structure  via  a  long  and  short  variance  swap  is  identical  to  a  position  in  a 
forward starting variance swap  (assuming the weights of the long and short variance swap 
are  correct;  if  not,  there  will  be  a  residual  variance  swap  position  left  over).  The  correct 
weighting  for  long  and  short  variance  swaps  to  be  identical  to  a  forward  starting  variance 
swap is detailed in the section 4.1 Forward Starting Products. If an investor wants to trade term 
structure,  but does  not  want  to  have  exposure  to  current  volatility  (ie,  wants  to  have  zero 
theta and gamma), then forward starting products (variance swaps or options) can be used. 
Note  that  while  forward  starting  products  have  no  exposure  to  current  realised  volatility, 
they  do  have  exposure  to  future  expectations  of  volatility  (ie,  implied  volatility  hence  has 
positive vega). 

 
 
7.4: How to Measure Skew and Smile 

201 

7.4: HOW TO MEASURE SKEW AND SMILE 

The implied volatilities for options of the same maturity, but of different strike, are 
different  from  each  other  for  two  reasons.  Firstly,  there  is  skew,  which  causes  low 
strike implieds to be greater than high strike implieds due to the increased leverage 
and risk of bankruptcy. Secondly, there is smile (or convexity/kurtosis), when OTM 
options have a higher implied than ATM options. Together, skew and smile create 
the ‘smirk’ of volatility surfaces. We look at how skew and smile change by maturity 
in  order  to  explain  the  shape  of  volatility  surfaces  both 
intuitively  and 
mathematically. We also examine which measures of skew are best, and why. 

MOMENTS DESCRIBE THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION 

In order to explain skew and smile, we shall break down the probability distribution of log 
returns  into  moments.  Moments  can  describe  the  probability  distribution29.  From  the 
formula  below  we  can  see  that  the  zero-th  moment  is  1  (as  the  sum  of  a  probability 
distribution  is  1,  as  the  probability  of  all  outcomes  is  100%).  The  first  moment  is  the 
expected value (ie, mean or forward) of the variable. The second, third and fourth moments 
are variance, skew and kurtosis, respectively (see table on the left below). For moments of 
two  or  greater  it  is  usual  to  look  at  central  moments,  or  moments  about  the  mean  (we 
cannot for the first moment as the first central moment would be 0). We shall normalise the 
central moment by dividing it by σn in order to get a dimensionless measure. The higher the 
moment, the greater the number of data points that are needed in order to get a reasonable 
estimate.

29 The combination of all moments can perfectly explain any distribution as long as the distribution 
has a positive radius of convergence or is bounded (eg, a sine wave is not bounded; hence, it cannot 
be explained by moments alone).

VEGA, VANNA AND VOLGA MEASURE 2ND, 3RD & 4TH MOMENTS 
While  there  is  not  an  exact  mapping,  the  Greeks  that  best  measure  the  2nd,  3rd  and  4th 
moments  are  vega,  vanna  and  volga  (VOL  GAmma)  respectively.  The  driver  for  these 
Greeks are implied volatility, skew and vol of vol.  

Options with high volga benefit from volatility of volatility 

Just as an option with high gamma benefits from high stock price volatility, an option with 
high  volga  benefits  from  volatility  of  volatility.  The  level  of  volatility  of  volatility  can  be 
calculated in a similar way to how volatility is calculated from stock prices (taking log returns 
is recommended for volatility as well). The more OTM an option is, the greater the volatility 
of volatility exposure. This is because the more implied volatility can change, the greater the 
chance of it rising and allowing an OTM option to become ITM. This gives the appearance 
of a ‘smile’, as the OTM option’s implied volatility is lifted while the ATM implied volatility 
remains constant. 

Stock returns have positive excess kurtosis and are leptokurtic 

Kurtosis is always positive30. Hence, excess kurtosis (kurtosis -3) is usually used. The kurtosis 
(or  normalised  fourth  moment)  of  the  normal  distribution  is  three;  hence,  normal 
distributions  have  zero  excess  kurtosis  (and  are  known  as  mesokurtic).  High  kurtosis 
distributions  (eg,  stock  price  log  returns)  are  known  as  leptokurtic,  whereas  low  kurtosis 
distributions (pegged currencies that change infrequently by medium-sized adjustments) are 
known as platykurtic. 

30 Kurtosis is only zero for a point distribution.

VEGA MEASURES SIZE OF VOLATILITY POSITION 

Vega measures the change in price of an option for a given (normally 1%) move in implied 
volatility. Implied volatility for far-dated options is relatively flat compared to near-dated, as 
both skew and kurtosis decay with maturity. Vega is highest for ATM options, as can be seen 
in the right hand chart in Figure 113 below.

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

IMPLIED VOL SMIRK IS A COMBINATION OF SKEW AND SMILE 

The final ‘smirk’ for options of the same maturity is the combination of skew (3rd moment) 
and  smile  (4th  moment).  The  exact  smirk  depends  on  maturity.  Kurtosis  (or  smile)  can  be 
assumed to decay with maturity by dividing by time34 and, hence, is most important for near-
dated  expiries.  For  medium-  (and  long-)  dated  expiries,  the  skew  effect  will  dominate 
kurtosis, as skew usually decays by the reciprocal of the square root of time (for more details, 
see the section A6 Modelling Volatility Surfaces in the Appendix). Skew for equities is normally 
negative and therefore have mean < median < mode (max) and a greater probability of large 
negative  returns  (the  reverse  is  true  for  positively  skewed  distributions).  For  far-dated 
maturities, the effect of both skew and kurtosis fades; hence, implieds converge to a flat line 
for  all  strikes.  Skew  can  be  thought  of  as  the  effect  of  changing  volatility  as  spot  moves, 
while smile can be thought of as the effect of jumps (up or down).

THERE ARE 3 WAYS TO MEASURE SKEW 

There are 3 main ways skew can be measured. While the first is the most mathematical, in 
practice the other 2 are more popular with market participants. 

  Third moment 

  Strike skew (eg, 90%-110%) 

  Delta skew (eg, [25 delta put – 25 delta call] / 50 delta) 

(1) THIRD MOMENT IS DEFINITION OF CBOE SKEW INDEX 

CBOE  have  created  a  skew  index  on  the  S&P500.  This  index  is  based  on  the  normalised 
third  central  moment;  hence,  it  is  strike  independent.  The  formula  for  the  index  is  given 
below. For normal negative skew, if the size of skew increases, so does the index (as negative 
skew is multiplied by -10). 

SKEW = 100 – 10 × 3rd moment 

 (2) STRIKE SKEW SHOULD NOT BE DIVIDED BY VOLATILITY 

The  most  common  method  of  measuring  skew  is  to  look  at  the  difference  in  implied 
volatility  between  two  strikes,  for  example  90%-110%  skew  or  90%-ATM  skew.  It  is  a 
common mistake to believe that strike skew should be divided by ATM volatility in order to 
take  into  account  the  fact  that  a  5pt  difference  is  more  significant  for  a  stock  with  20% 
volatility than 40% volatility. This ignores the fact that the strikes chosen (say 90%-110% for 
20% volatility stocks) should also be wider for high volatility stocks (say 80%-120%, or two 
times wider, for 40% volatility stocks as the volatility is 2×20%). The difference in implied 
volatility  should  be  taken  between  two  strikes  whose  width  between  the  strikes  is 
proportional to the volatility (similar to taking the implied volatility of a fixed delta, eg, 25% 
delta). An approximation to this is to take the fixed strike skew, and multiply by volatility, as 
shown  below.  As  the  two  effects  cancel  each  other  out,  we  can  simply  take  a  fixed  strike 
skew without dividing by volatility. 

Difference in vol between 2 strikes = 90-110% 

Difference in vol between 2 strikes whose width increases with vol = 90-110% × ATM 

Skew =  Difference in vol between 2 strikes whose width increases with vol 
ATM 

  Skew =  90-110% × ATM

  Skew =  90-110%

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

90%-100% (or 90%-110%) skew is correct measure for fixed strike skew 

The best measure of skew is one that is independent of the level of volatility. If this were not 
the  case,  then  the  measure  would  be  partly  based  on  volatility  and  partly  on  skew,  which 
would make it more difficult to determine if skew was cheap or expensive. We have shown 
mathematically  that  an  absolute  difference  (eg,  90%-110%  or  90%-100%)  is  the  correct 
measure  of  skew,  but  we  can  also  show  it  empirically.  The  left-hand  chart  in  Figure  119 
below  shows  that  there  is  no  correlation  between  volatility  and  skew  (90%-110%)  for  any 
European stocks that have liquid equity derivatives. If skew is divided by volatility, there is 
unsurprisingly  a  negative  correlation  between  this  measure  and  volatility  (see  right-hand 
chart below).

(3) DELTA SKEW IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO STRIKE SKEW 

Arguably  the  best  measure  of  skew  is  delta  skew,  where  the  difference  between  constant 
delta puts and calls is divided by 50 delta implied. An example of skew measured by delta is 
[25 delta put – 25 delta call] / 50 delta. As this measure widens the strikes examined as vol 
rises, in addition to normalising (ie, dividing) by the level of volatility, it is a ‘pure’ measure of 
skew (ie, not correlated to the level of volatility). While delta skew is theoretically the best 
measure, in practice it is virtually identical to strike skew. As there is a R2 of 93% between 
delta  skew  and  strike  skew,  we  believe  both  are  viable  measures  of  skew  (although  strike 
skew is arguably more practical as it represents a more intuitive measure).

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

7.5: SKEW TRADING 

The profitability of skew trades is determined by the dynamics of a volatility surface. 
We  examine  sticky  delta  (or  ‘moneyness’),  sticky  strike,  sticky  local  volatility  and 
jumpy volatility regimes. Long skew suffers a loss in both a sticky delta and sticky 
strike regimes due to the carry cost of skew. Long skew is only profitable with jumpy 
volatility. We also show how the best strikes for skew trading can be chosen. 

4 IDEALISED REGIMES DESCRIBE MOVEMENT OF VOL SURFACE 

There are four idealised regimes for a volatility surface. While sticky delta, sticky strike and 
(sticky)  local  volatility  are  well  known  and  widely  accepted  names,  we  have  added  ‘jumpy 
volatility’  to  define  volatility  with  a  high  negative  correlation  with  spot.  These  regimes  are 
summarised below, and more details are given on pages 216-222 of this section. 

(1)  Sticky  delta  (or  sticky  moneyness).  Sticky  delta  assumes  a  constant  volatility  for 
options of the same strike as a percentage of spot. For example, ATM or 100% strike 
volatility  has  constant  volatility.  As  this  model  implies  there  is  a  positive  correlation 
between volatility and spot, the opposite of what is usually seen in the market, it is not a 
particularly realistic model (except over a very long time horizon). 

(2)  Sticky strike. A sticky strike volatility surface has a constant volatility for options with 
the  same  fixed  currency  strike.  Sticky  strike  is  usually  thought  of  as  a  stable  (or 
unmoving)  volatility  surface  as  real-life  options  (with  a  fixed  currency  strike)  do  not 
change their implied volatility. 

(3)  Sticky local volatility. Local volatility is the instantaneous volatility of stock at a certain 
stock price. When local volatility is static, implied volatility rises when markets fall (ie, 
there  is  a  negative  correlation  between  stock  prices  and  volatility).  Of  all  the  four 
volatility regimes, it is arguably the most realistic and fairly prices skew. 

(4)  Jumpy  volatility.  We  define  a  jumpy  volatility  regime  as  one  in  which  there  is  an 
excessive jump in implied volatility for a given movement in spot. There is a very high 
negative correlation between spot and volatility. This regime usually occurs over a very 
short time horizon in panicked markets (or a crash).

LONG SKEW TRADES HAVE A COST (SKEW THETA) 

If an investor initiates a long skew position by buying an OTM put and selling an OTM call, 
the  implied  volatility  of  the  put  purchased  has  a  higher  implied  volatility  than  the  implied 
volatility sold through the call. The long skew position therefore has a cost associated with it, 
which  we  shall  define  as  ‘skew  theta’.  Skew  theta  is  the  difference  between  the  cost  of 
gamma (theta per unit of dollar gamma) of an OTM option compared to an ATM option. If 
skew is flat, then all strikes have an identical cost of gamma, but as OTM puts have a higher 
implied volatility than ATM ones they pay more per unit of gamma. Skew theta is explained 
in  greater  depth  at  the  end  of  this  section.  If  the  long  skew  position  does  not  give  the 
investor enough additional profit to compensate for the skew theta paid, then skew can be 
sold at a profit. 

Skew trades profit from negative spot volatility correlation 

If there is a negative correlation between the movement of a volatility surface and spot (as is 
usually seen in practice), then this movement will give a long skew position a profit when the 
volatility surface is re-marked. For example, let us assume an investor is long skew via a risk 
reversal  (long  an  OTM  put  and  short  an  OTM  call).  If  equity  markets  decline,  the  put 
becomes ATM and is the primary driver of value for the position (as the OTM call becomes 
further  OTM  it  is  far  less  significant).  The  rise  in  the  volatility  surface  (due  to  negative 
correlation between spot and volatility) boosts the value of the (now ATM) put and, hence, 
the value of the risk reversal. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
212 

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

SKEW TRADES BREAK EVEN IF LOCAL VOL IS CONSTANT 

If the local volatility surface stays constant, the amount volatility surfaces move for a change 
in spot is equal to the skew (ie, ATM volatility moves by twice the skew, once for moving up 
the  skew  and  another  by  the  movement  of  the  volatility  surface  itself).  This  movement  is 
exactly  the  correct  amount  for  the  profit  (or  loss)  on  a  volatility  surface  re-mark  to 
compensate  for  the  cost  (or  benefit)  of  skew  theta35.  The  profit  (or  loss)  caused  by  skew 
trades given the four volatility regimes are shown below.

SKEW IS USUALLY OVERPRICED DUE TO HEDGING 

As  volatility  markets  tend  to  trade  between  a  static  strike  and  static  local  volatility  regime, 
long skew trades are usually unprofitable (usually there is negative spot volatility correlation, 
but not enough to compensate for the skew theta). As long skew trades break even during 
static  local  volatility  regimes,  they  are  only  profitable  in  periods  of  jumpy  volatility.  This 
overpricing of skew can be considered to be a result of excessive demand for downside put 
options, potentially caused by hedging. Another reason for the overpricing of skew could be 
the  popularity  of  short  volatility  long  (downside)  skew  trades  (traders  often  hedge  a  short 
volatility  position  with  a  long  skew  (OTM  put)  position,  in  order  to  protect  themselves 
should markets suddenly decline). The profits from shorting expensive volatility are likely to 
more  than  compensate  for  paying  an  excessive  amount  for  the  long  skew  position  (OTM 
put). 

35 More details on local volatility can be found in the section A1 Local Volatility in the Appendix.

VOL REGIME DETERMINED BY TIME AND SENTIMENT 

Implied  volatility  can  be  thought  of  as  the  market’s  estimate  of  future  volatility36.  It  is 
therefore  investor  sentiment  that  determines  which  implied  volatility  regime  the  market 
trades  in,  and  this  choice  is  largely  determined  by  how  much  profit  (or  loss)  a  long  skew 
position  is  expected  to  reveal  over  a  certain  time  period.  The  choice  of  regime  is  also 
determined by the time horizon chosen. 

Sticky delta regimes occur over long time horizon or trending markets 

A sticky delta regime is typically one in which markets are trending in a stable manner (either 
up or down, with ATM volatility staying approximately constant) or over a very long time 
horizon of months or years (as over the long term the implied volatility mean reverts as it 
cannot go below zero or rise to infinity). 

Jumpy vol regimes occur over short time horizons and panicked markets 

It is rare to find a jumpy volatility regime that occurs over a long time horizon, as they tend 
to last for periods of only a few days or weeks. Markets tend to react in a jumpy volatility 
manner  after  a  sudden  and  unexpected  drop  in  equity  markets  (large  increase  in  implied 
volatility given a decline in spot) or after a correction from such a decline (a bounce in the 
markets  causing  implied  volatility  to  collapse).  Figure  124  below  summarises  the  different 
time horizons for the different volatility regimes.

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

Markets tend to trade between a sticky strike and sticky local vol regime 

Sticky delta and jumpy volatility are the two extremes of volatility regimes. Sticky strike and 
sticky  local  volatility  are  far  more  common  volatility  regimes.  Sticky  strike  is  normally 
associated  with  calmer  markets  than  sticky  local  volatility  (as  it  is  closer  to  a  sticky  delta 
model than jumpy volatility).

DELTA OF OPTION DEPENDS ON VOLATILITY REGIME 

How  a  volatility  surface  reacts  to  a  change  in  spot  changes  the  value  of  the  delta  of  the 
option. For sticky strike, as implied volatilities do not change, the delta is equal to the Black-
Scholes delta. 

However, if we assume a sticky delta volatility regime if an investor is long a call option, then 
the implied volatility of that option will decline if there is a fall in the market. The value of 
the call is therefore lower than expected for falls in the market. The reverse is also true as 
implied volatility increases if equities rise. As the value of the call is lower for declines and 
higher  for  rises  (as  volatility  is  positively  correlated  to  spot),  the  delta  is  higher  than  that 
calculated by Black-Scholes (which is equal to the sticky strike delta). 

A similar argument can be made for sticky local volatility (as volatility is negatively correlated 
to spot, the delta is less than the Black-Scholes delta). 

EXAMINE VOL IN RELATIVE OR ABSOLUTE DIMENSIONS 

To evaluate the profit – or loss – from a skew trade, assumptions have to be made regarding 
the  movement  of  volatility  surfaces  over  time.  As  we  assume  a  skew  trader  always  delta 
hedges, we are not concerned with the change in premium only the change in volatility.  

 
 
 
 
 
7.5: Skew Trading 

215 

Typically,  traders  use  two  main  ways  to  examine  implied  volatility  surfaces.  Absolute 
dimensions tend to be used when examining individual options, a snapshot of volatilities, or 
plotting implied  volatilities over a relatively short period of time. Relative dimensions tend 
to be used when examining implied volatilities over relatively long periods of time37. 

  Absolute dimensions. In absolute dimensions, implied volatility surfaces are examined 
in terms of fixed maturity (eg, Dec14 expiry) and fixed strike (eg, €4,000). This surface is 
a useful way of examining how the implied volatility of actual traded options changes. 

  Relative  dimensions.  An  implied  volatility  surface  is  examined  in  terms  of  relative 
dimensions when it is given in terms of relative maturity (eg, three months or one year) 
and relative strike (eg, ATM, 90% or 110%). Volatility surfaces tend to move in relative 
dimensions  over  a  very  long  period  of  time,  whereas  absolute  dimensions  are  more 
suitable for shorter periods of time. 

Care must be taken when examining implieds in relative dimensions 

As the options (and variance swaps) investors buy or sell are in fixed dimensions with fixed 
expiries and strikes, the change in implied volatility in absolute dimensions is the key driver 
of  volatility  profits  (or  losses).  However,  investors  often  use  ATM  volatility  to  determine 
when to enter (or exit) volatility positions, which can be misleading. For example, if there is 
a skew (downside implieds higher than ATM) and equity markets decline, ATM implieds will 
rise even though volatility surfaces remain stable. A plot of ATM implieds will imply buying 
volatility was profitable over the decline in equity markets; however, in practice this is not 
the case. 

Absolute implied volatility is the key driver for equity derivative profits 

As options that are traded have a fixed strike and expiry, it is absolute implied volatility that 
is the driver for equity derivative profits and skew trades. However, we accept that relative 
implied  volatility  is  useful  when  looking  at  long-term  trends.  For  the  volatility  regimes  (1) 
sticky  delta  and  (2)  sticky  strike,  we  shall  plot  implieds  using  both  absolute  and  relative 
dimensions  in  order  to  explain  the  difference.  For  the  remaining  two  volatility  regimes 
(sticky local volatility and jumpy volatility), we shall only plot implied volatility using absolute 
dimensions (as that is the driver of profits for traded options and variance swaps).  

37 This is usually for liquidity reasons, as options tend to be less liquid for maturities greater than two 
years (making implied volatility plots of more than two years problematic in absolute dimensions).

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

(1) STICKY DELTA ASSUMES ATM VOL IS CONSTANT 

A sticky delta model assumes a constant implied volatility for strikes as a percentage of spot 
(eg,  ATM  stays  constant).  How  a  volatility  surface  moves  with  a  change  in  spot  is  shown 
below for both absolute/fixed strike and relative strike in Figure 125.

RANGE-BOUND VOL SUPPORTS A STICKY DELTA MODEL 

As  implied  volatility  cannot  be  negative,  it  is  therefore  usually  floored  close  to  the  lowest 
levels of realised volatility. Although an infinite volatility is theoretically possible, in practice 
implied volatility is typically capped close to the all-time highs of realised volatility. Over a 
long  period  of  time,  ATM  implied  volatility  can  be  thought  of  as  being  range  bound  and 
likely to trend towards an average value (although this average value will change over time as 
the  macro  environment  varies).  As  the  trend  towards  this  average  value  is  independent  of 
spot, the implied volatility surface in absolute dimensions (fixed currency strike) has to move 
to  keep  implied  volatility  surface  in  relative  dimensions  (strike  as  percentage  of  spot) 
constant.  Thinking  of  implied  volatility  in  this  way  is  a  sticky  delta  (or  sticky  moneyness) 
implied volatility surface model. 

Sticky delta most appropriate over long term (many months or years) 

While over the long term implied volatility tends to return to an average value, in the short 
term volatility can trade away from this value for a significant period of time. Typically, when 
there is a spike in volatility it takes a few months for volatility to revert back to more normal 
levels.  This  suggests  a  sticky  delta  model  is  most  appropriate  for  examining  implied 
volatilities for periods of time of a year or more. As a sticky delta model implies a positive 
correlation  between  (fixed  strike)  implied  volatility  and  spot,  the  opposite  of  what  is 
normally seen, it is not usually a realistic model for short periods of time. Trending markets 
(calmly  rising  or  declining)  are  usually  the  only  situation  when  a  sticky  delta  model  is 
appropriate for short periods of time. In this case, the volatility surface tends to reset to keep 
ATM volatility constant, as this implied volatility level is in line with the realised volatility of 
the market.

LONG SKEW UNPROFITABLE IN STICKY DELTA VOL REGIME 

In a sticky delta volatility regime the fixed strike implied volatility (of traded options) has to 
be re-marked when spot moves. The direction of this re-mark for long skew positions causes 
a  loss,  as  skew  should  be  flat  if  ATM  volatility  is  going  to  remain  unchanged  as  markets 
move  (we  assume  skew  is  negative).  Additionally,  the  long  skew  position  carries  the 
additional  cost  of  skew  theta,  the  combination  of  which  causes  long  skew  positions  to  be 
very unprofitable. 

(2) STICKY STRIKE HAS NO SPOT VOL CORRELATION 

A  sticky  strike  model  assumes  that  options  of  a  fixed  currency  strike  are  fixed  (absolute 
dimensions).  The  diagrams  below  show  how  a  volatility  surface  moves 
in  both 
absolute/fixed strike and relative strike due to a change in spot.

TRADER’S SYSTEMS CAN GIVE ILLUSION OF STICKY STRIKE 

While Figure 124 above on page 214 describes which volatility regime normally applies in any 
given environment, there are many exceptions. A particular exception is that for very small 
time horizons volatility surfaces can seem to trade in a sticky strike regime. We believe this is 
due to many trading systems assuming a static strike volatility surface, which then has to be 
re-marked  by  traders  (especially  for  less  liquid  instruments,  as  risk  managers  are  likely  to 
insist  on  volatilities  being  marked  to  their  last  known  traded  implied  volatility)38.  As  the 
effect of these trading systems on pricing is either an illusion (as traders will re-mark their 
surface when asked to provide a firm quote) or well within the bid-offer arbitrage channel, 
we believe this effect should be ignored. 

38 Anchor delta measures the effect of re-marking a volatility surface and is described in the section 
A9 Advanced (Practical or Shadow) Greeks in the Appendix.

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

LONG SKEW IS UNPROFITABLE WITH STICKY STRIKE 

While  there  is  no  profit  or loss from  re-marking  a  surface  in  a  sticky  strike  model,  a  long 
skew position still has to pay skew theta. Overall, a long skew position is still unprofitable 
with sticky strike, but it is less unprofitable than with sticky delta. 

(3) STICKY LOCAL VOLATILITY PRICES SKEW FAIRLY 

As  a  sticky  local  volatility  causes  a  negative  correlation  between  spot  and  Black-Scholes 
volatility (shown below), this re-mark is profitable for long skew positions. As the value of 
this re-mark is exactly equal to the cost of skew theta, skew trades break even in a sticky local 
volatility regime. If volatility surfaces move as predicted by sticky local volatility, then skew is 
priced fairly (as skew trades do not make a loss or profit). 

BLACK-SCHOLES VOL IS AVERAGE OF LOCAL VOL 

Local  volatility  is  the  name  given  for  the  instantaneous  volatility  of  an  underlying  (ie,  the 
exact volatility it has at a certain point). The Black-Scholes volatility of an option with strike 
K  is  equal  to  the  average  local  (or  instantaneous)  volatility  of  all  possible  paths  of  the 
underlying  from  spot  to  strike  K.  This  can  be  approximated  by  the  average  of  the  local 
volatility at spot and the local volatility at strike K. This approximation gives two results39: 

  The ATM Black-Scholes volatility is equal to the ATM local volatility. 

  Black-Scholes skew is half the local volatility skew (due to averaging). 

Example of local volatility skew = 2x Black-Scholes skew 

The second point can be seen if we assume the local volatility for the 90% strike is 22% and 
the ATM local volatility is 20%. The 90%-100% local volatility skew is therefore 2%. As the 
Black-Scholes 90% strike option will have an implied volatility of 21% (the average of 22% 
and 20%), it has a 90%-100% skew of 1% (as the ATM Black-Scholes volatility is equal to 
the 20% ATM local volatility). 

39 As this is an approximation, there is a slight difference which we shall ignore.

STICKY LOCAL VOL => NEGATIVE SPOT VOL CORRELATION 

As local volatility skew is twice the Black-Scholes skew, and ATM volatilities are the same, a 
sticky  local  volatility  surface  implies  a  negative  correlation  between  spot  and  implied 
volatility.  This  can  be  seen  by  the  ATM  Black-Scholes  volatility  resetting  higher  if  spot 
declines and is shown in the diagrams above. 

Example of negative correlation between spot and Black-Scholes volatility 

We  shall  use  the  values  from  the  previous  example,  with  the  local  volatility  for  the  90% 
strike = 22%, Black-Scholes of the 90% strike = 21% and the ATM volatility for both (local 
and  Black-Scholes)  =  20%.  If  markets  decline  10%,  then  the  90%  strike  option  Black-
Scholes volatility will rise 1% from 21% to 22% (as ATM for both local and Black-Scholes 
volatility must be equal). This 1% move will occur in parallel over the entire surface (as the 
Black-Scholes skew has not changed). Similarly, should markets rise 10%, the Black-Scholes 
volatility surface will fall 1% (assuming constant skew).

LONG SKEW PROFITS FROM VOLATILITY SURFACE RE-MARK 

In  order  to  demonstrate  how  the  negative  correlation  between  spot  and  (Black-Scholes) 
implied  volatility  causes  long  skew  positions  to  profit  from  volatility  surfaces  re-mark,  we 
shall  assume  an  investor  is  long  a  risk  reversal  (long  OTM  put,  short  OTM  call).  This 
position is shown in Figure 128 above. 

When  markets  fall, the  primary  driver  of  the risk  reversal’s  value  is  the  put  (which  is now 
more ATM than the call), and the put value will increase due to the rise in implied volatility 
(due to negative correlation with spot). Similarly, the theoretical value of the risk reversal will 
rise  (as  the  call  is  now  more  ATM  –  and  therefore  the  primary  driver  of  value  –  and,  as 
implied volatilities decline as markets rise, the value of the short call will rise as well). The 
long skew position therefore profits from both a movement up or down in equity markets, 
as can be seen in the diagram below as both the long call and short put position increase in 
value.

VOL RE-MARK WITH STICKY LOCAL VOL = SKEW THETA 

While  a  sticky  local  volatility  regime  causes  long  skew  positions  to  profit  from  (Black-
Scholes)  implied  volatility  changes,  the  position  still  suffers  from  skew  theta.  The 
combination of these two cancel exactly, causing a long (or short) skew trade to break even. 
As skew trades break even under a static local volatility model, and as there is a negative spot 
vol correlation, it is arguably the most realistic volatility model.

(4) JUMPY VOLATILITY IS ONLY REGIME WHERE LONG 
SKEW IS PROFITABLE 

During  very  panicked  markets,  or  immediately  after  a  crash,  there  is  typically  a  very  high  correlation 
between spot and volatility. During this volatility regime (which we define as jumpy volatility) volatility 
surfaces move in excess of that implied by sticky local volatility. As the implied volatility surface re-mark 
for a long skew position is in excess of skew theta, long skew positions are profitable. A jumpy volatility 
regime tends to last for a relatively short period of time.

Example of volatility regimes and skew trading 

If  one-year  90%-100%  skew  is  25bp  per  1%  (ie,  2.5%  for  90-100%)  and  markets  fall  1%, 
volatility surfaces have to rise by 25bp for the profit from realised skew to compensate for 
the cost of skew theta. If surfaces move by more than 25bp, surfaces are moving in a jumpy 
volatility way and skew trades are profitable. If surfaces move by less than 25bp then skew 
trades suffer a loss. 

SKEW ONLY FAIRLY PRICED IF ATM MOVES BY TWICE THE SKEW 

For a given movement in spot from S0 to S1, we shall define the movement of the (Black-
Scholes)  implied  volatility  surface  divided  by  the  skew  (implied  volatility  of  strike  S 1  – 
implied volatility of strike S0) to be the realised skew. The realised skew can be thought of as 
the  profit  due  to  re-marking  the  volatility  surface.  Defining  realised  skew  to  be  the 
movement in the volatility surface is similar to the definition of realised volatility, which is 
the movement in spot. 

realised skew = movement of surface/skew 

where: 

movement of surface   = movement of surface when spot moves from S0 to S1 

skew  

= difference in implied volatility between S1 and S0 

The ATM volatility can then be determined by the below equation: 

ATMtime 1 = ATMtime 0 + skew + movement of surface 

ATMtime 1 = ATMtime 0 + skew + (skew × realised skew) 

ATMtime 1 = ATMtime 0 + skew × (1 + realised skew) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7.5: Skew Trading 

223 

The realised skew for sticky delta is therefore -1 in order to keep ATM constant (and hence 
skew flat) for all movements in spot. A sticky strike regime has a realised skew of 0, as there 
is  no  movement  of  the  volatility  surface  and  skew  is  fixed.  A  local  volatility  model  has  a 
realised skew of 1, which causes ATM to move by twice the value implied by a fixed skew. 
As local volatility prices skew fairly, skew is only fairly priced if ATM moves by twice the 
skew. We shall assume the volatility surface for jumpy volatility moves more than it does for 
sticky local volatility, hence has a realised skew of more than 1. 

Skew profit is proportional to realised skew – 1 (due to skew theta) 

In  order  to  calculate  the  relative  profit  (or  loss)  of  trading  skew,  the  value  of  skew  theta 
needs to be taken away, and this value can be thought of as -1. Skew profit is then given by 
the formula below: 

Skew profit α realised skew - 1 

SKEW TRADING IS EQUIVALENT TO TRADING 2ND ORDER GAMMA 

Determining the current volatility regime helps a trader decide if skew trades are likely to be 
profitable. In order to determine the strikes used to initiate long or short skew positions, a 
trader  needs  to  evaluate  the  richness  or  cheapness  of  skew  across  different  strikes.  It  is 
possible  to  show  intuitively,  and  mathematically,  that  skew  trading  is  very  similar  to  delta 
hedging gamma. Given this relationship, comparing vanna (dVega/dSpot), weighted by the 
square root of time, to skew theta can be a useful rule of thumb to identify potential trading 
opportunities.

markets fall, and a trader is trading skew using a long OTM put and short OTM call (ie, a 
risk reversal). As the delta of OTM options increases in value if implied volatility increases, 
and vice versa, the delta hedging of the long skew position is impacted by the movement in 
volatility surfaces.

Trader needs to buy stock (or futures) if market declines 

If there is a decline in spot, the volatility of the long put (which is now more ATM and the 
primary driver of value) increases. This causes the delta of the position to decrease (absolute 
delta of put increases and, as delta of put is negative, the delta decreases). A trader has to buy 
more stock (or futures) than expected in order to compensate for this change, as shown on 
the left of Figure 132  above.  

Conversely, trader needs to sell stock (or futures) if the market rises 

The opposite trade occurs if markets rise as, for an increase in spot, the volatility of the short 
call  (which  is now  more  ATM  and  the primary  driver of  value)  decreases. This  causes the 
delta  of  the  position  to  increase  (delta  of  call  decreases  as  delta  of  short  call  increases). 
Traders have to sell more stock (or futures) than they expect to compensate for this change 
(as shown on the right of Figure 132  above.), which is the reverse trade of that which occurs 
for a decline in the market.

DELTA HEDGING SKEW SIMILAR TO DELTA HEDGING GAMMA 

Let us assume a negative correlation between spot and volatility (ie, for sticky local volatility 
or jumpy volatility) and that a trader is initially delta hedged40 and intends to remain so. The 
movement of the volatility surface means the trader has to buy more stock (or futures) than 
he  expects  if  markets  fall  and  sell  more  stock  (or  futures)  if  markets  rise.  Buying low  and 
selling high locks in the profit from the long skew position. This trade is identical to delta 
hedging a long gamma position, which can be seen in Figure 133 above. 

If  there  is  a  positive  relationship  between  spot  and  volatility  (ie,  a  sticky  delta  volatility 
regime), then the reverse trade occurs with stock (or futures) being sold if markets decline 
and bought if markets rise. For sticky delta regimes, a long skew position is similar to being 
short gamma (and hence very unprofitable, given skew theta has to be paid as well). 

MATHEMATICALLY, SKEW TRADING α GAMMA TRADING 

It  is  possible  to  show  mathematically  the  relationship  between  skew  trading  and  gamma 
trading if one assumes a correlation between spot and volatility. Vanna, the rate of change in 
vega for a change in spot (dVega/dSpot) measures the size of a skew position. This can be 
seen intuitively from the arguments above; as markets decline, the OTM put becomes more 
ATM and hence the primary driver of value. It is this change in vega (long put dominating 
the short call) for a change in spot, that causes volatility surface re-marks to be profitable for 
skew trading. Vanna is not only equal to dVega/dSpot, but is also equal to dDelta/dVol41. 
The equations below show that this relationship, when combined with spot being correlated 
to volatility, links skew and gamma trading. 

Vanna = dDelta/dVol (and = dVega/dSpot) 

As Vol α Spot  

40 A long put and short call risk reversal would be delta hedged with a long stock (or futures) position. 
41 The proof of this relationship is outside of the scope of this publication

CHAPTER 7: SKEW AND TERM STRUCTURE TRADING 

Vanna α dDelta/dSpot 

As Gamma = dDelta/dSpot 

Vanna α Gamma 

Therefore,  gamma  can  be  considered  to  be  second  order  gamma  due  to  the  negative 
correlation between volatility and spot.  

SKEW THETA PAYS FOR SKEW, GAMMA THETA PAYS FOR GAMMA  

In order to break down an option’s profit into volatility and skew, the total theta paid needs 
to  be  separated  into  gamma  theta  and  skew  theta.  Gamma  theta  pays  for  gamma  (or 
volatility) while skew theta pays for skew. We note that skew across the term structure can 
be compared with each other if weighted by the square root of time. As skew is measured by 
vanna,  skew  theta  should  therefore  be  compared  to  power  vanna  (vanna  weighted  by  the 
square root of time) to identify skew trading opportunities. This is equivalent to comparing 
gamma to gamma theta. The method for calculating skew theta is given below. 

Total theta = gamma theta + skew theta (all measured in theta per units of cash gamma) 

Cash (or dollar) gamma = γ × S2 / 100 = notional cash value bought (or sold) per 1% spot 
move  

GAMMA THETA IDENTICAL FOR ALL OPTIONS IF IMPLIEDS 
IDENTICAL 

Gamma theta is the cost (or income) from a long (or short) gamma position. To calculate 
the  cost  of  gamma,  we  shall  assume  an  index  has  a  volatility  of  20%  for  all  strikes  and 
maturities. We shall ignore interest rates, dividends and borrowing costs and assume spot is 
currently at 3000pts.

Both gamma and theta are high for short-dated ATM options 

As can be seen in Figure 134 above, both cash gamma and theta are highest for near-dated 
and ATM options. When the cost per unit of cash gamma is calculated, it is identical for all 
strikes and expiries as the implied volatility is 20% for them all (see Figure 135 below).  This 
is, essentially, the values on the left in Figure 134 divided by the values on the right in Figure 
134. We shall define the ATM theta cost per unit of cash gamma to be gamma theta (in units 
of 1 million cash gamma to have a reasonably sized number).

TERM STRUCTURE CHANGES GAMMA THETA BY MATURITY 

In order to have a more realistic volatility surface we shall introduce positive sloping term 
structure (TS), while keeping the implied volatility of one-year maturity options identical. As 
there is no skew in the surface, all the theta is solely due to the cost of gamma or gamma 
theta. The gamma theta is now lower for near-dated maturities, which is intuitively correct as 
near-dated implieds are now lower than the far-dated implieds.

SKEW MAKES IT MORE EXPENSIVE TO OWN PUTS THAN CALLS 

If  we  introduce  skew to  the  volatility  surface  we  increase  the  cost of  gamma  for puts  and 
decrease it for calls. This can be seen on the right of Figure 137; the ATM options have the 
same cost of gamma as before but the wings now have a different value.

SKEW THETA IS THE COST OF GOING LONG SKEW 

As we have defined the theta paid for ATM option gamma (or gamma theta) as the fair price 
for gamma, the difference between this value and other options’ cost of gamma is the cost of 
skew  (or  skew  theta).  Skew  theta  is  therefore  calculated  by  subtracting  the  cost  of  ATM 
gamma from all other options (and hence skew theta is zero for ATM options by definition).

The  annual  cost  for  a  million  units  of  cash  gamma  for  three-month  90% strike  options  is 
€10,496, whereas ATM options only have to pay €7,163. The additional cost of being long 
90%  options  (rather  than  ATM)  is  therefore  €10,496  -  €7,163  =  €3,333.  This  additional 
€3,333 cost is the cost of being long skew, or skew theta. 

Strikes lower than ATM suffer from skew theta 

For low strike options there is a cost (negative sign) to owning the option and hence being 
long  skew.  High  strike  options  benefit  from  an  income  of  skew  theta  (which  causes  the 
lower cost of gamma) to compensate for being short skew (hence they have a positive sign). 

VOL SLIDE THETA HAS A MINOR EFFECT ON SKEW TRADING 

If  one  assumes  volatility  surfaces  have  relative  time  (one-year  skew  stays  the  same)  rather 
than  absolute  time  (ie,  Dec14  skew  stays  the  same)  then  one  needs  to  take  into  account 
volatility  slide  theta  (to  factor  in  the  increase  in  skew  as  the  maturity  of  the  option 
decreases).  Volatility  slide  theta  partly  compensates  for  the  cost  of  skew  theta.  For  more 
details, see the section A9 Advanced (Practical or Shadow) Greeks in the Appendix.

APPENDIX 

A.1: LOCAL VOLATILITY 

While  Black-Scholes  is  the  most  popular  method  for  pricing  vanilla  equity 
derivatives, exotic equity derivatives (and ITM American options) usually require a 
more  sophisticated  model.  The  most  popular  model  after  Black-Scholes  is  a  local 
volatility  model  as  it  is  the  only  completely  consistent  volatility  model42.  A  local 
volatility  model  describes  the  instantaneous  volatility  of  a  stock,  whereas  Black-
Scholes is the average of the instantaneous volatilities between spot and strike. 

LOCAL VOL IS INSTANTANEOUS VOL OF UNDERLYING 

Instantaneous volatility is the volatility of an underlying at any given local point, which we 
shall  call  the  local  volatility.  We  shall  assume  the  local  volatility  is  fixed  and  has  a  normal 
negative  skew  (higher  volatility  for  lower  spot  prices). There  are  many paths from  spot to 
strike and, depending on which path is taken, they will determine how volatile the underlying 
is during the life of the option (see Figure 139 below).

42 Strictly speaking, this is true only for deterministic models. However, as the expected volatility of 
non-deterministic  models  has  to  give  identical  results  to  a  local  volatility  model  to  be  completely 
consistent, they can be considered to be a ‘noisy’ version of a local volatility model.

BLACK-SCHOLES VOL IS AVERAGE OF LOCAL VOLATILITIES 

It  is  possible  to  calculate  the  local  (or  instantaneous)  volatility  surface  from  the  Black-
Scholes implied volatility surface. This is possible as the Black-Scholes implied volatility of 
an option is the average of all the paths between spot (ie, zero maturity ATM strike) and the 
maturity  and  strike  of  the  option.  A  reasonable  approximation  is  the  average  of  all  local 
volatilities on a direct straight-line path between spot and strike. For a normal relatively flat 
skew, this is simply the average of two values, the ATM local volatility and the strike local 
volatility. 

Black-Scholes skew is half local volatility skew as it is the average 

If the local volatility surface has a 22% implied at the 90% strike, and 20% implied at the 
ATM strike, then the Black-Scholes implied volatility for the 90% strike is 21% (average of 
22%  and  20%).  As  ATM  implieds  are  identical  for  both  local  and  Black-Scholes  implied 
volatility,  this  means  that  90%-100%  skew  is  2%  for  local  volatility  but  1%  for  Black-
Scholes. Local volatility skew is therefore twice the Black-Scholes skew. 

ATM volatility is the same for both Black-Scholes and local volatility 

For ATM implieds, the local volatility at the strike is equal to ATM, hence the average of the 
two identical numbers is simply equal to the ATM implied. For this reason, Black-Scholes 
ATM implied is equal to local volatility ATM implied. 

LOCAL VOL IS THE ONLY COMPLETE CONSISTENT VOL MODEL 

A  local  volatility  model  is  complete  (it  allows  hedging based  only  on  the  underlying  asset) 
and consistent (does not contain a contradiction). It is often used to calculate exotic option 
implied  volatilities  to  ensure  the  prices  for  these  exotics  are  consistent  with  the  values  of 
observed  vanilla  options  and  hence  prevent  arbitrage.  A  local  volatility  model  is  the  only 
complete  consistent  volatility  model;  a  constant  Black-Scholes  volatility  model  (constant 
implied volatility for all strikes and expiries) can be considered to be a special case of a static 
local  volatility  model  (where  the  local  volatilities  are  fixed  and  constant  for  all  strikes  and 
expiries).

APPENDIX 

A.2: MEASURING HISTORICAL VOLATILITY  

The  implied  volatility  for  a  certain  strike  and  expiry  has  a  fixed  value.  There  is, 
however, no single calculation for historical volatility. The number of historical days 
for  the  historical  volatility  calculation  changes  the  calculation,  in  addition  to  the 
estimate of the drift (or average amount stocks are assumed to rise). There should, 
however,  be  no  difference  between  the  average  daily  or  weekly  historical  volatility. 
We  also  examine  different  methods  of  historical  volatility  calculation,  including 
close-to-close volatility and exponentially weighted volatility, in addition to advanced 
volatility  measures  such  as  Parkinson,  Garman-Klass  (including  Yang-Zhang 
extension),  Rogers  and  Satchell  and  Yang-Zhang.  We  also  show  that  it  is  best  to 
assume  a  zero  drift  assumption  for  close-to-close  volatility,  and  that  under  this 
condition variance is additive. 

DEFINITION OF VOLATILITY 

Assuming  that  the  probability  distribution  of  the  log  returns  of  a  particular  security  is 
normally  distributed  (or  follows  a  normal  ‘bell-shape  distribution’),  volatility  σ  of  that 
security  can  be  defined  as  the  standard  deviation  of  the  normal  distribution  of  the  log 
returns.  As  the  mean  absolute  deviation  is  √(2/π)  (≈0.8)  ×  volatility,  the  volatility  can  be 
thought of as c1.25× the expected percentage change (positive or negative) of the security. 

σ= standard deviation of log returns × 

t∆/1

CLOSE-TO-CLOSE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY IS THE MOST 
COMMON 

Volatility  is  defined  as  the  annualised  standard  deviation  of  log  returns.  For  historical 
volatility the usual measure is close-to-close volatility, which is shown below.

A.2: Measuring Historical Volatility 

233 

Historical volatility is calculated as the standard deviation of the log returns of a particular 
securities’  time  series.  If  the  log  returns  calculation  is  based  on  daily  data,  we  have  to 
multiply  this  number by  the  square  root  of  252  (the  number  of  trading  days  in  a calendar 
= 252 ). As 
year) in order to annualise the volatility calculation (as 
a general rule, to annualise the volatility calculation, regardless of the periodicity of the data, 
the  standard  deviation  has  to  be  multiplied  by  the  square  root  of  the  number  of 
days/weeks/months within a year (ie, 

t∆ = 1/252 hence 

t∆/1

BEST TO ASSUME ZERO DRIFT FOR VOL CALCULATION 

The calculation for standard deviation calculates the deviation from the average log return 
(or  drift).  This  average  log  return  has  to  be  estimated  from  the  sample,  which  can  cause 
problems  if  the  return  over  the  period sampled  is  very  high  or  negative.  As  over  the  long 
term  very  high  or  negative  returns  are  not  realistic,  the  calculation  of  volatility  can  be 
corrupted by using the sample log return as the expected future return. For example, if an 
underlying rises 10% a day for ten days, the volatility of the stock is zero (as there is zero 
deviation from the 10% average return). This is why volatility calculations are normally more 
reliable if a zero return is assumed. In theory, the expected average value of an underlying at 
a future date should be the value of the forward at that date. As for all normal interest rates 
(and dividends, borrow cost) the forward return should be close to 100% (for any reasonable 
sampling frequency,  ie, daily/weekly/monthly). Hence,  for  simplicity reasons  it  is easier  to 
assume a zero log return as Ln(100%) = 0. 

WHICH HISTORICAL VOLATILITY SHOULD I USE? 

When  examining  how  attractive  the  implied  volatility  of  an  option  is,  investors  will  often 
compare it to historical volatility. However, historical volatility needs two parameters. 

  Length of time (eg, number of days/weeks/months) 

  Frequency of measurement (eg, daily/weekly) 

 
 
 
 
 
A.2: Measuring Historical Volatility 

235 

LENGTH OF TIME FOR HISTORICAL VOLATILITY 

Choosing  the  historical  volatility  number  of  days  is  not  a  trivial  choice.  Some  investors 
believe the best number of days of historical volatility to look at is the same as the implied 
volatility of interest. For example, one-month implied should be compared to 21 trading day 
historical  volatility  (and  three-month  implied  should  be  compared  to  63-day  historical 
volatility, etc). While an identical duration historical volatility is useful to arrive at a realistic 
minimum and maximum value over a long period of time, it is not always the best period of 
time to determine the fair level of long-dated implieds. This is because volatility mean reverts 
over a period of c8 months. Using historical volatility for periods longer than c8 months is 
not likely to be the best estimate of future volatility (as it could include volatility caused by 
earlier events, whose effect on the market has passed). Arguably a multiple of three months 
should be used to ensure that there is always the same number of quarterly reporting dates in 
the  historical  volatility  measure.  Additionally,  if  there  has  been  a  recent  jump  in  the  share 
price that is not expected to reoccur, the period of time chosen should exclude that jump.  

The best historical volatility period does not have to be the most recent 

If  there  has  been  a  rare  event  which  caused  a  volatility  spike,  the  best  estimate  of  future 
volatility is not necessary the current historical volatility. A better estimate could be the past 
historical  volatility  when  an  event  that  caused  a  similar  volatility  spike  occurred.  For 
example, the volatility post credit crunch could be compared to the volatility spike after the 
Great Depression or during the bursting of the tech bubble. 

FREQUENCY OF HISTORICAL VOLATILITY 

While historical volatility can be measured monthly, quarterly or yearly, it is usually measured 
daily  or  weekly.  Normally,  daily  volatility  is  preferable  to  weekly  volatility  as  five  times  as 
many  data  points  are  available.  However,  if  volatility  over  a  long  period  of  time  is  being 
examined  between  two  different  markets,  weekly  volatility  could  be  the  best  measure  to 
reduce the influence of different public holidays (and trading hours44). If stock price returns 
are  independent,  then  the  daily  and  weekly  historical  volatility  should  on  average  be  the 
independent,  there  could  be  a  difference.

Autocorrelation is the correlation between two different returns so independent returns have 
an autocorrelation of 0%.  

Trending markets imply weekly volatility is greater than daily volatility 

With  100%  autocorrelation,  returns  are  perfectly  correlated  (ie,  trending  markets).  Should 
autocorrelation be -100% correlated, then a positive return is followed by a negative return 
(mean reverting or range trading markets). If we assume markets are 100% daily correlated 
with a 1% daily return, this means the weekly return is 5%. The daily volatility is therefore

High market share of HFT should prevent autocorrelation 

Historically (decades ago), there could have been positive autocorrelation due to momentum 
buying,  but  once  this  became  understood  this  effect  is  likely  to  have  faded.  Given  the 
current  high  market  share  of  HFT  or  high  frequency  trading  (accounting  for  up  to  three-
quarters of US equity trading volume), it appears unlikely that a simple trading strategy such 
as  ‘buy  if  security  goes  up,  sell  if  it  goes  down’  will  provide  above-average  returns  over  a 
significant period of time45.  

Panicked markets could cause temporary negative autocorrelation 

While positive autocorrelation is likely to be arbitraged out of the market, there is evidence 
that markets can overreact at times of stress as market panic (rare statistical events can occur 
under  the  weak  form  of  efficient  market  hypotheses).  During  these  events  human  traders 
and  some  automated  trading  systems  are  likely  to  stop  trading  (as  the  event  is  rare,  the 
correct response is unknown), or potentially exaggerate the trend (as positions get ‘stopped 
out’  or  to  follow  the  momentum  of  the  move).  A  strategy  that  is  long  daily  variance  and 
short weekly variance will therefore usually give relatively flat returns, but occasionally give a 
positive return. 

INTRADAY VOLATILITY IS NOT CONSTANT 

For  most  markets,  intraday  volatility  is  greatest  just  after  the  open  (as  results  are  often 
announced  around  the  open)  and  just  before  the  close  (performance  is  often  based  upon 
closing  prices).  Intraday  volatility  tends  to  sag  in  the  middle  of  the  day  due  to  the 
combination  of  a  lack  of  announcements  and  reduced  volumes/liquidity  owing  to  lunch 
breaks. For this reason, using an estimate of volatility more frequent than daily tends to be

EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED VOL IS RARELY USED 

An  alternate  measure  could  be  to  use  an  exponentially  weighted  moving  average  model, 
which is shown below. The parameter λ is between zero (effectively one-day volatility) and 
one  (ignore  current  vol  and  keep  vol  constant).  Normally,  values  of  c0.9  are  used. 
Exponentially weighted volatilities are rarely used, partly due to the fact they do not handle 
regular volatility-driving events such as earnings very well. Previous earnings jumps will have 
least weight just before an earnings date (when future volatility is most likely to be high) and 
most  weight  just  after  earnings  (when  future  volatility  is  most  likely  to  be  low).  It  could, 
however, be of some use for indices.

Exponentially weighted volatility avoids volatility collapse of historic volatility 

Exponential volatility has the advantage over standard historical volatility in that the effect of 
a spike in volatility gradually fades (as opposed to suddenly disappearing causing a collapse in 
historic  volatility).  For  example,  if  we  are  looking  at  the  historical  volatility  over  the  past 
month and a spike in realised volatility suddenly occurs the historical volatility will be high 
for  a  month,  then  collapse.  Exponentially  weighted  volatility  will  rise  at  the  same  time  as 

 
 
 
 
 
238 

APPENDIX 

historical  volatility  and  then  gradually  decline  to  lower  levels  (arguably  in  a  similar  way  to 
how implied volatility spikes, then mean reverts). 

ADVANCED VOLATILITY MEASURES 

Close-to-close volatility is usually used as it has the benefit of using the closing auction prices 
only.  Should  other prices  be  used, then they  could  be vulnerable  to  manipulation or  a  ‘fat 
fingered’ trade. However, a large number of samples need to be used to get a good estimate 
of  historical  volatility,  and  using  a  large  number  of  closing  values  can  obscure  short-term 
changes  in  volatility.  There  are,  however,  different  methods  of  calculating  volatility  using 
some or all of the open (O), high (H), low (L) and close (C). The methods are listed in order 
of their maximum efficiency (close-to-close var divided by alternative measure var). 

  Close to close (C). The most common type of calculation that benefits from only using 
reliable prices from closing auctions. By definition its efficiency is one at all times. 

  Parkinson (HL). As this estimate only uses the high and low price for an underlying, it 
is less sensitive to differences in trading hours. For example, as the time of the EU and 
US closes are approximately half a trading day apart, they can give very different returns. 
Using the high and low means the trading over the whole day is examined, and the days 
overlap.  As  it  does  not  handle  jumps,  on  average  it  underestimates  the  volatility,  as  it 
does  not  take  into  account  highs  and  lows  when  trading  does  not  occur  (weekends, 
between close and open). Although it does not handle drift, this is usually small. While 
other measures are more efficient based on simulated data, some studies have shown it 
to be the best measure for actual empirical data. 

  Garman-Klass (OHLC). This estimate is the most powerful for stocks with Brownian 
motion, zero drift and no opening jumps (ie, opening price is equal to closing price of 
previous period). Like Parkinson, it also underestimates the volatility (as it assumes no 
jumps). 

  Rogers-Satchell (OHLC). The efficiency of the Rogers-Satchell estimate is similar to 
that  for  Garman-Klass;  however,  it  benefits from  being  able  to  handle  non-zero  drift. 
Opening  jumps  are  not  handled  well  though,  which  means  it  underestimates  the 
volatility. 

  Garman-Klass Yang-Zhang extension (OHLC). Yang-Zhang extended the Garman-
Klass method that allows for opening jumps hence it is a fair estimate, but does assume 
zero drift. It has an efficiency of eight times the close-to-close estimate. 

  Yang-Zhang  (OHLC).  The  most  powerful  volatility  estimator  which  has  minimum 
estimation error. It is a weighted average of Rogers-Satchell, the close-open volatility and 

 
A.2: Measuring Historical Volatility

the open-close volatility. It is up to a maximum of 14 times as efficient (for two days of 
data) as the close-to-close estimate.

EFFICIENCY AND BIAS DETERMINE BEST VOL MEASURE 

There  are  two  measures  that  can  be  used  to  determine  the  quality  of  a  volatility  measure: 
efficiency and bias. Generally, for small sample sizes the Yang-Zhang measure is best overall, 
and for large sample sizes the standard close to close measure is best.

where 

xσ  is the volatility of the estimate and 

ccσ  is 

the volatility of the standard close to close estimate. 

  Bias.  Difference  between  the  estimated  variance  and  the  average  (ie,  integrated) 

volatility. 

Efficiency measures the volatility of the estimate  

The  efficiency  describes  the  variance,  or  volatility  of  the  estimate.  The  efficiency  is 
dependent on the number of samples, with efficiency decreasing the more samples there are 
(as close-to-close will converge and become less volatile with more samples). The efficiency 
is  the  theoretical  maximum  performance  against  an  idealised  distribution,  and  with  real 
empirical  data  a  far  smaller  benefit  is  usually  seen  (especially  for  long  time  series).  For 
example, while the Yang-Zhang based estimators deal with overnight jumps if the jumps are 
large  compared  to  the  daily  volatility  the  estimate  will  converge  with  the  close-to-close 
volatility and have an efficiency close to one. 

Close-to-close vol should use at least five samples (and ideally 20 or more) 

The  variance  of  the  close-to-close  volatility  can  be  estimated  as  a  percentage  of  the  actual 
variance by the formula 1/(2N) where N is the number of samples. This is shown in Figure 
143  below  and  demonstrates  that  at  least  five  samples  are  needed  (or  the  estimate  has  an

Variance, volatility and gamma swaps should look at close to close 

As the payout of variance, volatility and gamma swaps are based on close-to-close prices, the 
standard  close-to-close  volatility  (or  variance)  should  be  used  for  comparing  their  price 
against  realised.  Additionally,  if  a  trader  only  hedges  at  the  close  (potentially  for  liquidity 
reasons) then again the standard close-to-close volatility measure should be used.

Bias depends on the type of distribution of the underlying 

While  efficiency  (how  volatile  the  measure  is)  is  important,  so  too  is  bias  (whether  the 
measure is, on average, too high or low). Bias depends on the sample size, and the type of 
distribution  the  underlying  security  has.  Generally,  the  close-to-close  volatility  estimator  is 
too big46 (as it does not model overnight jumps), while alternative estimators are too small 
(as  they  assume  continuous  trading,  and  discrete  trading  will  have  a  smaller  difference 
between the maximum and minimum). The key variables that determine the bias are:  

  Sample size. As the standard close-to-close volatility measure suffers with small sample 
sizes, this is where alternative measures perform best (the highest efficiency is reached 
for only two days of data). 

  Volatility  of  volatility.  While  the  close-to-close  volatility  estimate  is  relatively 
insensitive  to  a  changing  volatility  (vol  of  vol),  the  alternative  estimates  are  far  more 
sensitive. This bias increases the more vol of vol increases (ie, more vol of vol means a 
greater underestimate of volatility).  

  Overnight  jumps  between  close  and  open.  Approximately  one-sixth  of  equity 
volatility  occurs  outside  the  trading  day  (and  approximately  twice  that  amount  for 
ADRs). Overnight jumps cause the standard close-to-close estimate to overestimate the 
volatility,  as  jumps  are  not  modelled.  Alternative  estimates  that  do  not  model  jumps 
(Parkinson,  Garman  Klass  and  Rogers-Satchell)  underestimate  the  volatility.  Yang-
Zhang  estimates  (both  Yang-Zhang  extension  of  Garman  Klass  and  the  Yang-Zhang 
measure itself) will converge with standard close-to-close volatility if the jumps are large 
compared to the overnight volatility. 

  Drift of underlying. If the drift of the underlying is ignored as it is for Parkinson and 
Garman Klass (and the Yang Zhang extension of Garman Glass), then the measure will 
overestimate  the  volatility.  This  effect  is  small  for  any  reasonable  drifts  (ie,  if  we  are 
looking at daily, weekly or monthly data). 

  Correlation  daily  volatility  and  overnight  volatility.  While  Yang-Zhang  measures 
deal with overnight volatility, there is the assumption that overnight volatility and daily 
volatility  are  uncorrelated.  Yang-Zhang  measures  will  underestimate  volatility  when 
there is a correlation between daily return and overnight return (and vice versa), but this 
effect is small.

CLOSE-TO-CLOSE 

APPENDIX 

The  simplest  volatility  measure  is  the  standard  close-to-close  volatility.  We  note  that  the 
volatility should be the standard deviation multiplied by √N/(N-1) to take into account the 
fact we are sampling the population (or take standard deviation of the sample)47. We ignored 
this in the earlier definition as for reasonably large n it √N/(N-1) is roughly equal to one.

The  first  advanced  volatility  estimator  was  created  by  Parkinson  in  1980,  and  instead  of 
using closing prices it uses the high and low price. One drawback of this estimator is that it 
assumes  continuous  trading,  hence  it  underestimates  the  volatility  as  potential  movements 
when the market is shut are ignored.

GARMAN-KLASS  

Later  in  1980  the  Garman-Klass  volatility  estimator  was  created.  It  is  an  extension  of 
Parkinson which includes opening and closing prices (if opening prices are not available the 
close  from  the  previous  day  can  be  used  instead).  As  overnight  jumps  are  ignored  the 
measure underestimates the volatility.

All of the previous advanced volatility measures assume the average return (or drift) is zero. 
Securities  that  have  a  drift,  or  non-zero  mean,  require  a  more  sophisticated  measure  of 
volatility. The Rogers-Satchell volatility created in the early 1990s is able to properly measure 
the volatility for securities with non-zero mean. It does not, however, handle jumps; hence, it 
underestimates the volatility.

GARMAN-KLASS YANG-ZHANG EXTENSION  

Yang-Zhang modified the Garman-Klass volatility measure in order to let it handle jumps. 
The measure does assume a zero drift; hence, it will overestimate the volatility if a security 
has a non-zero mean return. As the effect of drift is small, the fact continuous prices are not 
available  usually  means  it  underestimates  the  volatility  (but  by  a  smaller  amount  than  the 
previous alternative measures).

YANG-ZHANG  

APPENDIX 

In 2000 Yang-Zhang created a volatility measure that handles both opening jumps and drift. 
It is the sum of the overnight volatility (close-to-open volatility) and a weighted average of 
the Rogers-Satchell volatility and the open-to-close volatility. The assumption of continuous 
prices does mean the measure tends to slightly underestimate the volatility.

A.3: PROOF IMPLIED JUMP FORMULA 

In the section 6.4 Trading earnings announcements/jumps we showed that the implied jump 
from an earnings announcement (or any one off event) can be backed out from the 
implied volatility of two options. We prove the formula for the expected daily return 
from the implied volatility jump. 

ADDITIVE VAR ALLOWS JUMP VOL TO BE CALCULATED 

The  formula  for  calculating  the  jump  volatility  (which  relies  on  variance  being  additive)  is 
shown below.

PROOF OF IMPLIED JUMP (EXPECTED DAILY RETURN) 

The derivation of how to calculate the implied daily return on the day of the jump (which is 
a  combination  of  the  normal  daily  move  and  the  effect  of  the  jump)  from  the  implied

APPENDIX 

A.4: PROOF VARIANCE SWAPS CAN BE HEDGED BY 

LOG CONTRACT (=1/K2) 

A log contract is a portfolio of options of all strikes (K) weighted by 1/K2. When this 
portfolio of options is delta hedged on the close, the payoff is identical to the payoff 
of a variance swap. We prove this relationship and hence show that the volatility of a 
variance swap can be hedged with a static position in a log contract. 

PORTFOLIO OF OPTIONS WITH CONST VEGA WEIGHTED 1/K2 
In order to prove that a portfolio of options with flat vega has to be weighted 1/K2, we will 
define  the  variable  x  to  be  K/S  (strike  K  divided  by  spot  S).  With  this  definition  and 
assuming  zero  interest  rates,  the  standard  Black-Scholes  formula  for  vega  of  an  option 
simplifies to: 

Vega of option = τ × S × f(x, v) 

where  

x = K / S (strike a ratio of spot)

APPENDIX 

A.5: PROOF VARIANCE SWAP NOTIONAL = VEGA/2σ  

For  small  differences  between  the  future  volatility  and  current  (implied)  swap 
volatility, the payout of a volatility swap can be approximated by a variance swap. We 
show how the difference in their notionals should be weighted by 2σ. 

Proof that Variance Swap Notional = vega/2σ  

We  intend  to  calculate  the  relative  size  (Z)  of  the  variance  swap  notional  compared  to 
volatility swap notional (volatility swap notional = vega by definition) so they have a similar 
payout (for small differences between realised and implied volatility). 

Notional variance swap ≈ Z × Notional volatility swap 

  (σF – σS) ≈ Z (σF

2 – σS

2)  

where: 

σF = future volatility (that occurs over the life of contract) 

σS = swap rate volatility (fixed at the start of contract) 

As  there  is  a  small  difference  between  future  (realised)  volatility  and  swap  rate  (implied) 
volatility, then we can define σF = σS + x where x is small. 

  ((σS + x) – σS) ≈ Z ( (σS + x)2 - σS

2) for simplification we shall replace σS with σ  

  x ≈ Z ( (σ2 + 2σx + x2) - σ2)  

  x ≈ Z (2σx + x2)  

  1 ≈ Z (2σ + x) and as x is small 

  1/2σ ≈ Z  

Hence Notional variance swap = vega / 2σ (as vega = Notional volatility swap) 

 
A.6: Modelling Volatility Surfaces 

251 

A.6: MODELLING VOLATILITY SURFACES 

There are a variety of constraints on the edges of a volatility surface, and this section 
details some of the most important constraints from both a practical and theoretical 
point  of  view.  We  examine  the  considerations  for  very  short-dated  options  (a  few 
days  or  weeks),  options  at  the  wings  of  a  volatility  surface  and  very  long-dated 
options. 

IMPLIED VOL IS LESS USEFUL FOR NEAR-DATED OPTIONS 

Options that only have a few days or a few weeks to expiry have a very small premium. For 
these  low-value  options,  a  relatively  small  change  in  price  will  equate  to  a  relatively  large 
change in implied volatility. This means the implied volatility bid-offer arbitrage channel is 
wider, and hence less useful. The bid-offer spread is more stable in cash terms for options of 
different maturity, so shorter-dated options should be priced more by premium rather than 
implied volatility. 

Need to price short-dated options with a premium after a large collapse in the 
market 

If there has been a recent dip in the market, there is a higher than average probability that 
the markets could bounce back to their earlier levels. The offer of short-dated ATM options 
should not be priced at a lower level than the size of the decline. For example, if markets 
have  dropped  5%,  then  a  one-week  ATM  call  option  should  not  be  offered  for  less  than 
c5% due to the risk of a bounce-back. 

SKEW SHOULD DECAY BY SQUARE ROOT OF TIME 

The payout of a put spread (and call spread) is always positive; hence, it should always have a 
positive cost. If it was possible to enter into a long put (or call) spread position for no cost 
(or  potentially  earning  a  small  premium),  any  rational  investor  would  go  long  as  large  a 
position  as  possible  and  earn  risk-free  profits  (as  the  position  cannot  suffer  a  loss).  A  put 
spread will have a negative cost if the premium earned by selling the lower strike put is more 
than  the  premium  of  the  higher  strike  put  bought.  This  condition  puts  a  cap  on  how 
negative skew can be: for high (negative) skew, the implied of the low strike put could be so 
large the premium is too high (ie, more than the premium of higher strike puts). The same 
logic applies for call spreads, except this puts a cap on positive skew (ie, floor on negative 
skew). As skew is normally negative, the condition on put spreads (see  

Figure  144  below  on  the  left)  is  usually  the  most  important.  As  time  increases,  it  can  be 
shown that the cap and floor for skew (defined as the gradient of first derivative of volatility 
with  respect  to  strike,  which  is  proportional  to  90%-100%  skew)  decays  by  roughly  the 
square root of time. This gives a mathematical basis for the ‘square root of time rule’ used by 
traders.

Far-dated skew should decay by time for long maturities (c5 years) 

It is possible to arrive at a stronger limit to the decay of skew by considering leveraged ratio 
put spreads (see chart above on the right). For any two strikes A and B (assume A<B), then 
the  payout  of  going  long  A×  puts  with  strike  B,  and  going  short  B×  puts  with  strike  A 
creates  a  ratio  put  spread  whose  value  cannot  be  less  than  zero.  This  is  because  the 
maximum payouts of both the long and short legs (puts have maximum payout with spot at 
zero) is A×B. This can be seen in the  

Figure 144 above on the right (showing a 99-101 101x99 ratio put spread). Looking at such 
leveraged ratio put spreads enforces skew decaying by time, not by the square root of time. 
However, for reasonable values of skew this condition only applies for long maturities (c5 
years). 

PROOF SKEW IS CAPPED AND FLOORED BY √TIME 

Enforcing positive values for put and call spreads is the same as the below two conditions: 

  Change  in  price  of  a  call  when  strike  increases  has  to  be  negative  (intuitively 

makes sense, as you have to pay more to exercise the higher strike call). 

  Change in price of a put when strike increases has to be positive (intuitively makes 

sense, as you receive more value if the put is exercised against you). 

These conditions are the same as saying the gradient of x (=Strike/Forward) is bound by:

Proof of theoretical cap for skew works in practice 

In  the  above  example,  for  a  volatility  of  25%  the  mathematical  lower  bound  for  one-year 
skew (gradient of volatility with respect to strike) is -1.39. This is the same as saying that the 
maximum  difference  between  99%  and  100%  strike  implied  is  1.39%  (ie,  90%-100%  or 
95%-105% skew is capped at 13.9%). This theoretical result can be checked by pricing one-
year put options with Black-Scholes. 

  Price 100% put with 25% implied = 9.95% 

  Price 99% put with 26.39% implied = 9.95% (difference of implied of 1.39%) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
254 

APPENDIX 

In practice, skew is likely to be bounded well before mathematical limits 

While a 90%-100% one-year skew of 13.9% is very high for skew, we note buying cheap put 
spreads  will  appear  to  be  attractive  long  before  the  price  is  negative.  Hence,  in  practice, 
traders are likely to sell skew long before it hits the mathematical bounds for arbitrage (as a 
put spread’s price tends to zero as skew approaches the mathematical bound). However, as 
the  mathematical  bound  decays  by  the  square  root  of  time,  so  too  should  the  ‘market 
bound’. 

OTM IMPLIEDS AT WINGS HAVE TO BE FLAT IN LOG SPACE 

While it is popular to plot implieds vs delta, it can be shown for many models48 that implied 
volatility  must  be  linear  in  log  strike  (ie,  Ln[K/F])  as  log  strike  goes  to  infinity.  Hence  a 
parameterisation  of  a  volatility  surface  should,  in  theory,  be  parameterised  in  terms  of  log 
strike, not delta. In practice, however, as the time value of options for a very high strike is 
very small, modelling implieds against delta can be used as the bid-offer should eliminate any 
potential arbitrage.

A.7: BLACK-SCHOLES FORMULA 

The most popular method of valuing options is the Black-Scholes-Merton model. We 
show  the  key  formulas  involved  in  this  calculation.  The  assumptions  behind  the 
model are also discussed. 

BLACK-SCHOLES MAKES A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS 

It is often joked that Black-Scholes is the wrong model with the wrong assumptions that gets 
the  right  price.  The  simplicity  of  the  model  has  ensured  that  it  is  still  used  despite  the 
competition from other, more complicated models. The assumptions are below: 

  Constant (known) volatility 

  Constant interest rates 

  No dividends (a constant dividend yield can, however, be incorporated into the interest 

rate) 

  Zero borrow cost, zero trading cost and zero taxes 

  Constant trading 

  Stock price return is log normally distributed 

  Can trade infinitely divisible amounts of securities 

  No arbitrage

APPENDIX 

DELTA MEASURES EQUITY EXPOSURE 

The most commonly examined Greek is delta, as it gives the equity sensitivity of the option 
(change  of  option  price  due  to  change  in  underlying  price).  Delta  is  normally  quoted  in 
percent. For calls it lies between 0% (no equity sensitivity) and 100% (trades like a stock). 
The delta of puts lies between -100% (trades like short stock) and 0%. If a call option has a 
delta  of  50%  and  the  underlying  rises  €1,  the  call  option  increases  in  value  €0.50  (=  €1  * 
50%).  Note  the  values  of  the  call  and  put  delta  in  the  formula  below  give  the  equity 
sensitivity of a forward of the same maturity as the option expiry. The equity sensitivity to 
spot is slightly different. Please note that there is a (small) difference between the probability 
that an option expires ITM and delta.

GAMMA MEASURES CONVEXITY (AMOUNT EARN HEDGING) 

Gamma measures the change in delta due to the change in underlying price. The higher the 
gamma,  the  more  convex  is  the  theoretical  payout.  Gamma  should  not  be  considered  a 
measure  of  value  (low  or  high  gamma  does  not  mean  the  option  is  expensive  or  cheap); 
implied volatility is the measure of an option’s value. Options are most convex, and hence 
have  the  highest  gamma,  when  they  are  ATM  and  also  about  to  expire.  This  can  be  seen 
intuitively as the delta of an option on the day of expiry will change from c0% if spot is just 
below  expiry  to  c100%  if  spot  is  just  above  expiry  (a  small  change  in  spot  causes  a  large 
change in delta; hence, the gamma is very high).

THETA MEASURES TIME DECAY (COST OF LONG GAMMA) 

Theta  is  the  change  in  the  price  of  an  option  for  a  change  in  time  to  maturity;  hence,  it 
measures  time  decay.  In  order  to  find  the  daily  impact  of  the  passage  of  time,  its value  is 
normally divided by 252 (trading days in the year). If the second term in the formula below is 
ignored,  the  theta  for  calls  and  puts  are  identical  and  proportional  to  gamma.  Theta  can 
therefore be considered the cost of being long gamma.

VEGA MEASURES VOL EXPOSURE (AVERAGE OF GAMMAS) 

Vega gives the sensitivity to volatility of the option price. Vega is normally divided by 100 to 
give the price change for a 1 volatility point (ie, 1%) move in implied volatility. Vega can be 
considered to be the average gamma (or non-linearity) over the life of the option. As vega 
has a √T in the formula power vega (vega divided by square root of time) is often used as a 
risk measure (to compensate for the fact that near dated implieds move more than far-dated 
implieds).

RHO MEASURES INTEREST RATE RISK (RELATIVELY SMALL) 

Rho measures the change in the value of the option due to a move in the risk-free rate. The 
profile  of  rho  vs  spot  is  similar  to  delta,  as  the  risk-free  rate  is  more  important  for  more 
equity-sensitive options (as these are the options where there is the most benefit in selling 
stock and replacing it with an option and putting the difference in value on deposit). Rho is 
normally divided by 10,000 to give the change in price for a 1bp move.

VOLGA MEASURES VOLATILITY OF VOLATILITY EXPOSURE 

Volga is short for VOLatility GAmma, and is the rate of change of vega due to a change in 
volatility.  Volga  (or  Vomma/vega  convexity)  is  highest  for  OTM  options  (approximately 
10% delta), as these are the options where the probability of moving from OTM to ITM has 
the greatest effect on its value. For more detail on Volga, see the section 7.4 How to Measure

VANNA MEASURES SKEW EXPOSURE 

Vanna has two definitions as it measures the change in vega given a change in spot and the 
change in delta due to a change in volatility. The change in vega for a change in spot can be 
considered to measure the skew position, as this will lead to profits on a long skew trade if 
there is an increase in volatility as spot declines. The extreme values for vanna occur for c15 
delta options, similar to volga’s c10 delta peaks. For more detail on vanna, see the section 7.4 
How to Measure Skew and Smile.

APPENDIX 

A.9: ADVANCED (PRACTICAL OR SHADOW) GREEKS 

How a volatility surface changes over time can impact the profitability of a position. 
While the most important aspects have already been covered (and are relatively well 
understood  by  the  market)  there  are  ‘second  order’  Greeks  that  are  less  well 
understood.  Two  of  the  most  important  are  the  impact  of  the  passage  of  time  on 
skew (volatility slide theta), and the impact of a movement in spot on OTM options 
(anchor  delta).  These  Greeks  are  not  mathematical  Greeks,  but  are  practical  or 
‘shadow’ Greeks. 

SKEW INCREASE AS TIME PASSES CAUSES ‘VOL SLIDE THETA’ 

As an option approaches expiry, its maturity decreases. As near-dated skew is larger than far-
dated skew, the skew of a fixed maturity option will increase as time passes. This can be seen 
by  assuming  that  skew  by  maturity  (eg,  three-month  or  one-year)  is  constant  (ie,  relative 
time, the maturity equivalent of sticky moneyness or sticky delta). We also assume that three-
month skew is larger than the value of one year skew. If we buy a low strike one year option 
(ie, we are long skew) then, assuming spot and ATM volatility stay constant, when the option 
becomes a three-month option its implied will have risen (as three-month skew is larger than 
one-year skew and ATM volatility has not changed). We define ‘volatility slide theta’ as the 
change in price of an option due to skew increasing with the passage of time49.  

VOL SLIDE THETA IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR NEAR EXPIRIES  

Given that skew increases as maturity decreases, this change in skew will increase the value 
of long skew positions (as in the example) and decrease the value of short skew positions. 
The  effect  of  ‘volatility  slide  theta’  is  negligible  for  medium-  to  far-dated  maturities,  but 
increases  in  importance  as  options  approach  expiry.  If  a  volatility  surface  model  does  not 
take into account ‘volatility slide theta’, then its impact will be seen when a trader re-marks 
the volatility surface. 

VOL SLIDE THETA MEASURES IMPACT OF CONST SMILE RULE  

The  constant smile rule  (CSR)  details  how forward  starting  options should  be  priced.  The 
impact of this rule on valuations is given by the ‘volatility slide theta’ as they both assume a 
fixed  maturity  smile  is  constant.  The  impact  of  this  assumption  is  more  important  for 
forward starting options than for vanilla options. 

49  While  we  concentrate  on  Black-Scholes  implied  volatilities,  volatility  slide  theta  also  affects  local 
volatility surfaces.

WHEN TRADERS CHANGE THEIR ‘ANCHOR’ THIS INTRODUCES A 
SECOND ORDER DELTA (‘ANCHOR DELTA’) 

Volatility  surfaces  are  normally  modelled  via  a  parameterisation. One  of  the  more popular 
parameterisations is to set the ATMf volatility from a certain level of spot, or ‘anchor’, and 
then define the skew (slope). While this builds a reasonable volatility surface for near ATM 
options, the wings will normally need to be slightly adjusted. Normally a fixed skew for both 
downside puts and upside calls will cause upside calls to be too cheap (as volatility will be 
floored) and downside puts to be too expensive (as volatility should be capped at some level, 
even for very low strikes). As the ‘anchor’ is raised, the implied volatility of OTM options 
declines (assuming the wing parameters for the volatility surface stay the same). We call this 
effect ‘anchor delta’. 

Implied volatility has to be floored, and capped, for values to be realistic 

There are many different ways a volatility surface parameterisation can let traders correct the 
wings,  but  the  effect  is  usually  similar.  We  shall  simply  assume  that  the  very  OTM  call 
implied volatility is lifted by a call accelerator, and very OTM put implied volatility is lowered 
by  a  put  decelerator.  This  is  necessary  to  prevent  call  implieds  going  too  low  (ie,  below 
minimum  realised  volatility),  or  put  implieds  going  too  high  (ie,  above  maximum  realised 
volatility). The effect of these wing parameters is shown in Figure 152 below.

APPENDIX 

Traders tend to refresh a surface by only changing the key parameters 

For liquid underlyings such as indices, a volatility surface is likely to be updated several times 
a day (especially if markets are moving significantly). Usually only the key parameters will be 
changed,  and  the  less  key  parameters  such  as  the  wing  parameters  are  changed  less 
frequently. We shall assume that there will be many occasions where there is a movement in 
spot along the skew (ie, static strike for near ATM strikes). In these cases a trader is likely to 
change the anchor (and volatility at the anchor, which has moved along the skew), but leave 
the  remaining  skew  and  wing  parameters  (which  are  defined  relative  to  the  anchor) 
unchanged. In order to have the same implied volatility for OTM options after changing the 
anchor,  the  call  accelerator  should  be  increased  and  the  put  decelerator  decreased.  In 
practice  this  does  not  always  happen,  as  wing  parameters  are  typically  changed  less 
frequently. The effect of an increase in anchor along the (static strike) skew while leaving the 
wing parameters unchanged is shown below.

OTM options have a second order ‘anchor delta’ 

To  simplify  the  example  we  shall  assume  the  call  wing  parameter  increases  the  implied 
volatility  for  strikes  110%  and  more,  and  the  put  wing  parameter  decreases  the  implied 
volatility  for  strikes  90%  or  lower.  If  spot  rises  10%,  the  120%  call  implied  volatility  will 
suffer when the anchor is re-marked 10% higher, because the call implied volatility is initially 
lifted by the call wing parameter (which no longer has an effect). OTM calls therefore have a 
negative ‘anchor delta’ as they lose value as anchor rises. Similarly, as anchor rises the effect 
of the put wing will increase, lowering the implied volatility of puts of strike 90% or less as 
anchor rises. So, under this scenario all options that are OTM have a negative ‘anchor delta’ 
that needs to be hedged.

A.10: SHORTING STOCK BY BORROWING SHARES 

The hedging of equity derivatives assumes you can short shares by borrowing them. 
We show the processes involved in this operation. The disadvantages, and benefits, 
to an investor who lends out shares are also explained. 

NO COUNTERPARTY RISK WHEN YOU LEND SHARES 

To short shares initially, the shares must first be borrowed. In order to remove counterparty 
risk, when an investor lends out shares he/she receives collateral (cash, stock, bonds, etc) for 
the same value. Both sides retain the beneficial ownership of both the lent security and the 
collateral,  so  any  dividends,  coupons,  rights  issues  are  passed  between  the  two  parties.  If 
cash is used as collateral, the interest on the cash is returned. Should a decision have to be 
made, ie, to receive a dividend in cash or stock, the decision is made by the original owner of 
the security. The only exception is that the voting rights are lost, which is why lent securities 
are often called back before votes.

Mark to market P&L has to be settled in cash 

To ensure there is no counterparty risk during the time the security is lent out, the collateral 
and lent security is marked to market and the difference settled for cash (while a wide range 
of securities can be used as initial collateral, only cash can be used for the change in value of 
the lent security). 

SELLING STOCK YOU HAVE BORROWED GIVES SHORT POSITION 

Once an investor has borrowed shares, these shares can be sold in the market. The proceeds 
from this sale can be used as the collateral given to the lender. Selling borrowed shares gives 
a short position, as profits are earned if the stock falls (as it can be bought back at a lower 
price than it was sold for, and then returned to the original owner).

APPENDIX 

EARN SHORT REBATE WHEN YOU SHORT 

The investor who has shorted the shares receives interest on the collateral, but has to pass 
dividends and borrow cost to the original owner. The net of these cash flows is called the 
short rebate, as it is the profit (or loss for high dividend paying stocks) that occurs if there is 
no change in the price of the shorted security. Shorting shares is therefore still profitable if 
shares rise by less than the short rebate. 

Short rebate = interest rate (normally central bank risk free rate) – dividends – borrow cost

A.11: SORTINO RATIO 

If an underlying is distributed normally, standard deviation is the perfect measure of 
risk.  For  returns  with  a  skewed  distribution,  such  as  with  option  trading  or  call 
overwriting, there is no one perfect measure of risk; hence, several measures of risk 
should be used. The Sortino is one of the most popular measures of skewed risk, as it 
only takes into account downside risk. 

SORTINO RATIO IS MODIFICATION OF SHARPE RATIO 

The Sharpe ratio measures the excess return, or amount of return (R) that is greater than the 
target  rate  of  return  (T).  Often  zero  or  risk-free  rate  is  used  as  the  target  return.  To  take 
volatility  of  returns  into  account,  this  excess  return  is  divided  by  the  standard  deviation. 
However, this takes into account both upside and downside risks. As investors are typically 
more focused on downside risks, the Sortino ratio modifies the Sharpe ratio calculation to 
only  divide  by  the  downside  risk (DR). The  downside risk  is  the  square  root  of  the  target 
semivariance, which can be thought of as the amount of standard deviation due to returns 
less than the target return. The Sortino ratio therefore only penalises large downside moves, 
and is often thought of as a better measure of risk for skewed returns.

APPENDIX 

A.12: CAPITAL STRUCTURE ARBITRAGE 

When Credit Default Swaps were created in the late 1990’s, they traded independently 
of the equity derivative market. The high levels of volatility and credit spreads during 
the  bursting  of  the  TMT  bubble  demonstrated  the  link  between  credit  spreads, 
equity,  and  implied  volatility.  We  examine  four  models  that  demonstrate  this  link 
(Merton model, jump diffusion, put vs CDS, and implied no-default volatility). 

NORMALLY TRADE CREDIT VS EQUITY, NOT VOLATILITY 

Capital structure arbitrage models can link the price of equity, credit and implied volatility. 
However, the relatively wide bid-offer spreads of equity derivatives mean trades are normally 
carried  out  between  credit  and  equity  (or  between  different  subordinations  of  credit  and 
preferred  shares  vs  ordinary  shares).  The  typical  trade  is  for  an  investor  to  go  long  the 
security that is highest in the capital structure, for example, a corporate bond (or potentially 
a convertible bond), and short a security that is lower in the capital structure, for example, 
equity. Reverse trades are possible, for example, owning a subordinated higher yielding bond 
and  shorting  a  senior  lower  yielding  bond  (and  earning  the  positive  carry  as  long  as 
bankruptcy does not occur). Only for very wide credit spreads and high implied volatility is 
there  a  sufficiently  attractive  opportunity  to  carry  about  an  arbitrage  between  credit  and 
implied  volatility.  We  shall  concentrate  on  trading  credit  vs  equity,  as  this  is  the  most 
common type of trade. 

Credit spread is only partly due to default risk 

The  OAS  (Option  Adjusted  Spread)  of  a  bond  over  the  risk-free  rate  can  be  divided  into 
three categories. There is the expected loss from default; however, there is also a portion due 
to general market risk premium and additionally a liquidity cost. Tax effects can also have an 
effect  on  the  corporate  bond  market.  Unless  a  capital  structure  arbitrage  model  takes  into 
account the fact that not all of a bond’s credit spread is due to the risk of default, the model 
is likely to fail. The fact that credit spreads are higher than they should be if bankruptcy risk 
was  the  sole  risk  of  a  bond  was  often  a  reason  why  long  credit  short  equity  trades  have 
historically been more popular than the reverse (in addition to the preference to being long 
the security that is highest in the capital structure in order to reduce losses in bankruptcy). 

 
A.12: Capital Structure Arbitrage 

271 

CDS usually better than bonds for credit leg, as they are unfunded and easier 
to short  

Using CDS rather than corporate bonds can reduce many of the discrepancies in spread that 
a corporate bond suffers and narrow the difference between the estimated credit spread and 
the  actual  credit spread.  We  note  that  CDS  are  an  unfunded  trade  (ie,  leveraged), whereas 
corporate bonds are a funded trade (have to fund the purchase of the bond) that has many 
advantages when there is a funding squeeze (as occurred during the credit crunch). CDS also 
allow  a  short  position  to  be  easily  taken,  as  borrow  for  corporate  bonds  is  not  always 
available, is usually expensive and can be recalled at any time. While borrow for bonds was 
c50bp before the credit crunch it soared to c5% following the crisis. 

Credit derivatives do not have established rules for equity events 

While  credit  derivatives  have  significant  language  against  credit  events,  they  have  no 
language for equity events, such as special dividends or rights issues. Even for events such as 
takeovers and mergers, where there might be relevant documentation, credit derivatives are 
likely to behave differently than equity (and equity derivatives). 

CREDIT CAN LEAD EQUITY MARKET AND VICE VERSA 

We  note  that  there  are  occasions  when  corporate  bond  prices  lag  a  movement  in  equity 
prices,  simply  as  traders  have  not  always  updated  levels  (but  this  price  would  be  updated 
should an investor request a firm price). CDS prices suffer less from this effect, and we note 
for many large companies the corporate bond market is driven by the CDS market and not 
vice  versa  (the  tail  wags  the  dog).  Although  intuitively  the  equity  market  should  be  more 
likely to lead the CDS market than the reverse (due to high frequency traders and the greater 
number of market participants), when the CDS market is compared to the equity market on 
average  neither  consistently  leads  the  other.  Even  if  the  CDS  and  equity  on  average  react 
equally  as  quickly  to  new  news,  there  are  still  occasions  when  credit  leads  equity  and  vice 
versa.  Capital  structure  arbitrage  could  therefore  be  used  on  those  occasions  when  one 
market has a delayed reaction to new news compared to the other. 

GREATEST OPPORTUNITY ON BBB OR BB RATED BONDS 

In  order  for  capital  structure  arbitrage  to  work,  there  needs  to  be  a  strong  correlation 
between credit and equity. This is normally found in companies that are rated BBB or BB. 
The credit spread for companies with ratings of A or above is normally more correlated to 
the  general  credit  supply  and  interest  rates  than  the  equity  price.  For  very  speculative 
companies  (rated  B  or  below),  the  performance  of  their  debt  and  equity  is  normally  very 
name-specific, and often determined by the probability of takeover or default. 

 
272 

APPENDIX 

Capital structure arbitrage works best when companies don’t default 

Capital structure arbitrage is a bet on the convergence of equity and credit markets. It has 
the best result when a company in financial distress recovers, and the different securities it 
has issued converge. Should the company enter bankruptcy, the returns are less impressive. 
The risk to the trade is that the company becomes more distressed, and as the likelihood of 
bankruptcy  increases  the  equity  and  credit  markets  cease  to  function  properly.  This  could 
result in a further divergence or perhaps closure of one of the markets, potentially forcing a 
liquidation of the convergence strategy. 

FUNDAMENTALS CAN DWARF STATISTICAL RELATIONSHIPS 

Capital  structure  arbitrage  assumes  equity  and  credit  markets  move  in  parallel.  However, 
there are many events that are bullish for one class of investors and bearish for another. This 
normally happens when the leverage of a company changes suddenly. Takeovers and rights 
issues  are  the  two  main  events  that  can  quickly  change  leverage.  Special  dividends,  share 
buybacks and a general reduction of leverage normally have a smaller, more gradual effect. 

Rights issue. A rights issue will always reduce leverage, and is effectively a transfer of value 
from  equity  holders  to  debt  holders  (as  the  company  is  less  risky,  and  earnings  are  now 
divided amongst a larger number of shares). 

Takeover  bid  (which  increases  leverage).  When  a  company  is  taken  over,  unless  the 
acquisition is solely for equity, a portion of the acquisition will have to be financed with cash 
or  debt  (particularly  during a  leveraged  buyout).  In  this  case,  the  leverage  of  the  acquiring 
company will increase, causing an increase in credit spreads and a reduction in the value of 
debt. Conversely, the equity price of the acquiring company is more stable. For the acquired 
company, the equity price should jump close to the level of the bid and, depending on the 
structure of the offer, the debt could fall (we note that if the acquired company is already in 
distress the value of debt can rise; for example, when Household was acquired by HSBC). 

GM EQUITY SOARED A DAY BEFORE CREDIT SANK 

On  May  4,  2005,  Kirk  Kerkorian  announced  the  intention  to  increase  his  (previously 
unknown)  stake  in  GM,  causing  the  troubled  company’s  share  price  to  soar  18%  intraday 
(7.3% close to close). The following day, S&P downgraded GM and Ford to ‘junk’, causing a 
collapse in the credit market and a 122bp CDS rise in two days. As many capital structure 
arbitrage investors had a long credit short equity position, both legs were loss making and 
large losses were suffered.

CORRELATION BETWEEN CREDIT AND EQUITY IS LOW AT STOCK 
LEVEL 

For  many  companies  the  correlation  between  equity  and  credit  is  not  particularly  strong, 
with a typical correlation between 5% and 15%. Hence it is necessary for a capital structure 
arbitrage  investor  to  have  many  different  trades  on  simultaneously.  The  correlation  of  a 
portfolio of bonds and equities is far higher (c90%).

MODELLING THE LINK BETWEEN CREDIT AND IMPLIED VOL 

While  there  are  many  models  that  show  the  link  between  the  equity,  equity  volatility  and 
debt of a company, we shall restrict ourselves to four of the most popular. 

  Merton model. The Merton model uses the same model as Black-Scholes, but applies it 
to a firm. If a firm is assumed to have only one maturity of debt, then the equity of the 
company can be considered to be a European call option on the value of the enterprise 
(value of enterprise = value of debt + value of equity) whose strike is the face value of 
debt. This model shows how the volatility of equity rises as leverage rises. The Merton 
model  also  shows  that  an  increase  in  volatility  of  the enterprise  increases  the  value  of 
equity (as equity is effectively long a call on the value of the enterprise), and decreases 
the value of the debt (as debt is effectively short a put on the enterprise, as they suffer 
the downside should the firm enter bankruptcy but the upside is capped). 

  Jump diffusion. A jump diffusion model assumes there are two parts to the volatility of 
a stock. There is the diffusive (no-default) volatility, which is the volatility of the equity 
without  any  bankruptcy  risk,  and  a  separate  volatility  due  to  the  risk  of  a  jump  to 
bankruptcy.  The  total  volatility  is  the  sum  of  these  two  parts.  While  the  diffusive 
volatility is constant, the effect on volatility due to the jump to bankruptcy is greater for 
options of low strike than high strike causing ‘credit induced skew’. This means that as 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A.12: Capital Structure Arbitrage 

275 

the  credit  spread  of  a  company  rises,  this  increases  the  likelihood  of  a  jump  to 
bankruptcy  and  increases  the  skew.  A  jump  diffusion  model  therefore  shows  a  link 
between credit spread and implied volatility. 

  Put vs CDS. As the share price of a company in default tends to trade close to zero, a 
put  can  be  assumed  to  pay  out  its  strike  in  the  even  of  default.  This  payout  can  be 
compared to the values of a company’s CDS, or its debt market (as the probability of a 
default can be estimated from both). As a put can also have a positive value even if a 
company does not default, the value of a CDS gives a floor to the value of puts. As 1xN 
put  spreads  can  be  constructed  to  never  have  a  negative  payout,  various  caps  to  the 
value  of  puts  can  be  calculated  by  ensuring  they  have  a  cost.  The  combination  of  the 
CDS  price  floor,  and  put  price  cap,  gives  a  channel  for  implieds  to  trade  without any 
arbitrage between CDS and put options. 

  No-default implied volatility. Using the above put vs CDS methodology, the value of 
a put price due to the payout in default can be estimated. If this value is taken away from 
the put price, the remaining price can be used to calculate a no-default implied volatility 
(or  implied  diffusive  volatility).  The  skew  and  term  structure  of  implied  no-default 
implied volatilities are flatter than Black-Scholes implied volatility, which allows an easier 
comparison and potential for identifying opportunities. 

(1) MERTON MODEL 

The  Merton  model  assumes  that  a  company  has  an  enterprise  value  (V)  whose  debt  (D) 
consists of only one zero coupon bond whose value at maturity is K. These assumptions are 
made in order to avoid the possibility of a default before maturity (which would be possible 
if there was more than one maturity of debt, or a coupon had to be paid. The company has 
one class of equity (E) that does not pay a dividend. The value of equity (E) and debt (D) at 
maturity is given below. 

Enterprise value = V = E + D 

Equity = Max(V – K, 0) = call on V with strike K 

Debt = Min(V, K) = K – Max(K – V, 0) = Face value of debt K – put on V with strike K

D (debt)

Enterprise value of a firm at maturity has to be at least K or it will enter 
bankruptcy 

Before the maturity of the debt, the enterprise has obligations to both the equity and debt 
holders. At the maturity of the debt, if the value of the enterprise is equal to or above K, the 
enterprise will pay off the debt K and the remaining value of the firm is solely owned by the 
equity holders. If the value of the enterprise is below K then the firm enters bankruptcy. In 
the event of bankruptcy, the equity holders get nothing and the debt holders get the whole 
value of the enterprise V (which is less than K). 

Equity is long a call on the value of a firm 

If  the  value  of  the  enterprise  V  is  below  the  face  value  of  debt  K  at  maturity  the  equity 
holders receive nothing. However, if V is greater than K, the equity holders receive V - K. 
The equity holders therefore receive a payout equal to a call option on V of strike K. 

Debt is short a put on value of firm  

The maximum payout for owners of debt is the face value of debt. This maximum payout is 
reduced by the amount the value of the enterprise is below the face value of debt at maturity. 
Debt is therefore equal to the face value of debt less the value of a put on V of strike K. 

 
 
 
 
A.12: Capital Structure Arbitrage 

277 

DEBT HAS A DELTA THAT CAN BE ARBITRAGED VS EQUITY 

As the value of the short put has a delta, debt has a delta. It is therefore possible to go long 
debt  and  short  equity  (at  the  calculated  delta  using  the Merton  model)  as  part of  a  capital 
structure arbitrage trade. 

If enterprise value is unchanged, then if value of equity rises, value of credit 
falls 

As enterprise value is equal to the sum of equity and debt, if enterprise value is kept constant 
then  for  equity  to  rise  the  value  of  debt  must  fall.  An  example  would  be  if  a  company 
attempts to move into higher-risk activity, lifting its volatility. As equity holders are long a 
call on the value of the company they benefit from the additional time value. However, as 
debt holders are short a put they suffer should a firm move into higher-risk activities. 

Merton model assumes too high a recovery rate 

Using the vanilla Merton model gives unrealistic results with credit spreads that are too tight. 
This  is  because  the  recovery  rate  (of  V/K)  is  too  high.  However,  using  more  advanced 
models (eg, stochastic barrier to take into account the default point is unknown), the model 
can be calibrated to market data. 

MERTON MODEL EXPLAINS EQUITY SKEW 

The volatility of an enterprise should be based on the markets in which it operates, interest 
rates  and  other  macro risks.  It  should,  however,  be  independent  of  how  it  is  funded.  The 
proportion of debt to equity therefore should not change the volatility of the enterprise V; 
however, it does change the volatility of the equity E. It can be shown that the volatility of 
equity  is  approximately  equal  to  the  volatility  of  the  enterprise  multiplied  by  the  leverage 
(V/E). Should the value of equity fall, the leverage will rise, lifting the implied volatility. This 
explains  skew:  the  fact  that  options  of  lower  strike  have  an  implied  volatility  greater  than 
options of high strike. 

σE ≈ σV × V / E (= σV × leverage)

Firms with a small amount of debt have equity volatility roughly equal to firm 
volatility 

If  a  firm  has  a  very  small  (or  zero)  amount  of  debt,  then  the  value  of  equity  and  the 
enterprise are very similar. In this case, the volatility of the equity and enterprise should be 
very similar (see Figure 160 above). 

Firms with high value of debt to equity have very high equity volatility 

For enterprises with very high levels of debt, a relatively small percentage change in the value 
of the enterprise V represents a relatively large percentage change in the value of equity. In 
these  cases  equity  volatility  will  be  substantially  higher  than  the  enterprise  volatility  (see 
Figure 161).

Proof equity volatility is proportional to leverage 

The mathematical relationship between the volatility of the enterprise and volatility of equity 
is given below. The N(d1) term adjusts for the delta of the equity. 

σE = N(d1) × σV × V / E 

If we assume the enterprise is not distressed and the equity is ITM, then N(d1) or delta of 
the  equity  should  be  very  close  to  1  (it  is  usually  c90%).  Therefore,  the  equation  can  be 
simplified so the volatility of equity is proportional to leverage (V / E). 

σE ≈ σV × leverage

APPENDIX 

(2) JUMP DIFFUSION 

A jump diffusion model separates the movement of equities into two components. There is 
the  diffusive  volatility,  which  is  due  to  random  log-normally  distributed  returns  occurring 
continuously over time. In addition, there are discrete jumps the likelihood of which is given 
by a credit spread. The total of the two processes is the total volatility of the underlying. It is 
this total volatility that should be compared to historic volatility or Black-Scholes volatility. 

Default risk explained by credit spread 

For simplicity, we shall assume that in a jump diffusion model the jumps are to a zero stock 
price as the firm enters bankruptcy, but results are similar for other assumptions. The credit 
spread  determines  the  risk  of  entering  bankruptcy.  If  a  zero  credit  spread  is  used,  the 
company will never default. The probability of default increases as the credit spread increases 
(approximately linearly).

JUMP DIFFUSION CAUSES CREDIT-INDUCED SKEW 

To  show  how  credit  spread  (or  bankruptcy)  causes  credit-induced  skew,  we  shall  price 
options  of  different  strike  with  jump  diffusion,  keeping  the  diffusive  volatility  and  credit 
spread  constant.  Using  the  price  of  the  option,  we  shall  then  calculate  the  Black-Scholes 
implied volatility. The Black-Scholes implied volatility is higher for lower strikes than higher 
strikes, causing skew. 

Credit-induced skew is caused by ‘option on bankruptcy’ 

The time value of an option will be divided between the time value due to diffusive volatility 
and  the  time  value  due  to  the  jump  to  zero  in  bankruptcy.  High  strike  options  will  be 
relatively unaffected by the jump to bankruptcy, and the Black-Scholes implied volatility will 
roughly  be  equal  to  the  diffusive  volatility.  However,  the  value  of  a  jump  to  a  zero  stock 
price will be relatively large for low strike put options (which, due to put call parity, is the 
implied  for  all  options).  The  difference  between  the  Black-Scholes  implied  and  diffusive 
volatility could be considered to be the value due to the ‘option on bankruptcy’. 

(3) PUT VS CDS 

The  probability  distribution  of  a  stock  price  can  be  decomposed  into  the  probability  of  a 
jump  close  to  zero  due  to  credit  events  or  bankruptcy,  and  the  log-normal  probability 
distribution that occurs when a company is not in default. While the value of a put option 
will be based on the whole probability distribution, the value of a CDS will be driven solely 
by  the  probability  distribution  due  to  default.  The  (bi-modal)  probability  distribution  of  a 
stock price due to default, and when not in default, is shown below.

Puts can be used instead of CDS (as puts pay out strike price in event of 
bankruptcy) 

When a stock defaults, the share price tends to fall to near zero. The recovery rate of equities 
can only be above zero if debt recovers 100% of face value, and most investors price in a 
c40% recovery rate for debt. A put can therefore be assumed to pay out the maximum level 
(ie, the strike) in the event of default. Puts can therefore be used as a substitute for a CDS. 
The number of puts needed is shown below. 

Value of puts in default = Strike × Number of Puts 

Value of CDS in default = (100% – Recovery Rate) × Notional 

In order to substitute value of puts in default has to equal value of CDS in default. 

Strike × Number of Puts = (100% – Recovery Rate) × Notional 

Number of Puts = (100% – Recovery Rate) × Notional / Strike

CDS PRICES PROVIDE FLOOR FOR PUTS 

As a put can have a positive value even if a stock is not in default, a CDS must be cheaper 
than the equivalent number of puts (equivalent number of puts chosen to have same payout 
in event of default, ie, using the formula above). If a put is cheaper than a CDS, an investor 
can initiate a long put-short CDS position and profit from the difference. This was a popular 
capital structure arbitrage trade in the 2000-03 bear market, as not all volatility traders were 
as focused on the CDS market as they are now, and arbitrage was possible. 

CDS in default must have greater return than put in default (without 
arbitrage) 

As  a  CDS  has  a  lower  price  for  an  identical  payout  in  default,  a  CDS  must  have a  higher 
return in default than a put. Given this relationship, it is possible to find the floor for the 
value of a put. This assumes the price of a CDS is ‘up front’ ie, full cost paid at inception of 
the contract rather than quarterly. 

Puts return in default = Strike / Put Price 

CDS return in default = (100% – Recovery Rate) / CDS Price 

As CDS return in default must be greater than or equal to put return in default. 

  (100% – Recovery Rate) / CDS Price ≥ Strike / Put Price  

  Put Price ≥ Strike × CDS Price / (100% – Recovery Rate)  

PUT VS CDS IS A POPULAR TRADE 

As the prices of the put and CDS are known, the implied recovery rate can be backed out 
using the below formula. If an investor’s estimate of recovery value differs significantly from 
this level, a put vs CDS trade can be initiated. For a low (or zero) recovery rate, the CDS 
price is too high and a short CDS long put position should be initiated. Conversely, if the 
recovery rate is too high, a CDS price is too cheap and the reverse (long CDS, short put) 
trade should be initiated. 

Put Price = Strike × CDS Price / (100% – Implied Recovery Rate) 

RATIO PUT SPREADS CAP VALUE OF PUTS 

CDSs provide a floor to the price of a put. It is also possible to cap the price of a put by 
considering ratio put spreads. For example, if we have the price for the ATM put, this means 
we know that the value of a 50% strike put cannot be greater than half the ATM put price. If 
not, we could purchase an ATM-50% 1×2 put spread (whose payout is always positive) and 
earn  a  premium  for  free.  This  argument  can  be  used  for  all  strikes  K  and  all  1xN  put 
spreads, and is shown below:

ARBITRAGE MOST LIKELY WITH LOW STRIKE AND LONG MATURITY 

The combination of CDS prices providing a floor, and put prices of higher strikes providing 
a cap, gives a corridor for the values of puts. The width of this corridor is narrowest for low 
strike  long  maturity  options,  as  these  options  have  the  greatest  percentage  of  their  value 
associated with default risk. As for all capital structure arbitrage strategies, companies with 
high credit spreads are more likely to have attractive opportunities and arbitrage is potentially 
possible for near-dated options. 

(4) NO-DEFAULT IMPLIED VOLATILITY 

The volatility of a stock price can be decomposed into the volatility due to credit events or 
bankruptcy and the volatility that occurs when a company is not in default. This is similar to 
the  volatility  due  to  jumps  and  the  diffusive  volatility  of  a  jump  diffusion  model.  As  the 
value of a put option due to the probability of default can be calculated from the CDS or 
credit market, if this value was taken away from put prices this would be the ‘no-default put 
price’  (ie,  the  value  the  put  would  have  if  a  company  had  no  credit  risk).  The  implied 
volatility  calculated  using  this  ‘no-default  put  price’  would  be  the  ‘no-default  implied 
volatility’. No-default implied volatilities are less than the vanilla implied volatility, as vanilla 
implied volatilities include credit risk). 

No-default implied volatilities have lower skew and term structure 

While we derive the no-default implied volatility from put options, due to put call parity the 
implied volatility of calls and puts is identical for European options. As the value of a put 
associated  with  a  jump  to  default  is  highest  for  low-strike  and/or  long-dated  options,  no-
default implied volatilities should have a lower skew and term structure than vanilla Black-
Scholes implied volatilities. A no-default implied volatility surface should therefore be flatter 
than  the  standard  implied  volatility  surface  and,  hence,  could  be  used  to  identify  potential 
trading opportunities.
