ABSTRACT  
This article presents the analyze of the cryptocurrency market, the practice of state regulation of the cryptocurrency. The study of 
the cryptocurrency market and the experience of its regulation revealed certain similarities.  Cryptogrivna, which can be put into 
circulation, means the formation of new institutional conditions for the development and functioning of the national financia l 
market. At the same time, it is important to understand that cryptocurrency cannot completely replace traditional means of 
payment and payment methods, either in the medium or in the short term. In this regard, in order to ensure national economic 
security, the unification of the current tax and financial legislation with acts of international law,  in terms of economic and 
organizational approaches to the circulation and emission of world and national cryptocurrencies, is of particular relevance.  This 
will make it possible to create a number of new financial instruments that can be used to stimulate  the growth of the national 
economy, which today is gradually emerging from the crisis zone, showing a trend towards further growth.  
Keywords : market capitalizations, Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, blockchain, digitalization, di gital economy, legal

1. INTRODUCTION  
The world economy is in a permanent state of 
transformation: technological structures, material values, 
and regulation mechanisms are changing. This process 
can be accelerated by the emergence of new factors that  
change the fundamental foundations of the modern 
market economy.  
Historically, money is centrally managed almost 
everywhere states through central state banks, starting 
from their issue and ending with the rules circulation, 
denomination and disposal. Und oubtedly there is a 
positive side to this, but there is also a negative one. At 
the same time, you need to understand that legal norms 
are secondary to social, which, in turn, appear in 
connection with certain phenomena, arising, in fact, in a 
legal vacuum . So it was with the advent of radio, cars, the 
Internet and many other achievements of scientific and 
technological progress. Same is happening now with new 
alternative money - cryptocurrencies - products of 
innovative blockchain technologies.  
Currently, such a factor is global digitalization, which 
has influenced the development of almost all spheres of 
the economy. As a result, new markets, new forms of communication, new approaches to organizing and 
managing the production of goods and the pr ovision of 
services have emerged. Active digitalization has led to 
the formation of a digital profile of a person, 
characterizing all aspects of his life, and also contributed 
to certain worldview changes - along with material or 
"tangible" values, digital  ones have appeared: starting 
from rights to intellectual property (music, films, 
applications, etc.) and ending with characters in computer 
online games. These goods and services began to be 
“produced”, bought and sold in the global digital 
marketplace, w hich since its inception had no geographic 
boundaries. A feature of this market is that the vast 
majority of goods and services are consumed and used in 
the digital space. This results in faster communication 
and “delivery” of digital products between sell ers and 
buyers. At the same time, the servicing of purchase and 
sale transactions was (and is) carried out using fiat money 
and banking infrastructure. Understanding the essence 
and popularity of this phenomenon requires a more 
detailed consideration of th e prerequisites for the 
emergence of cryptocurrency and the motives of 
economic entities (citizens, firms, banks and countries) 
who began to use it.

Among the most popular cryptocurrencies in the 
world, the leaders of growth were Bitcoin, Ethereum, 
DASH, M onero and NEM - they own 91% of the total 
capitalization [ 1]. The price of the first cryptocurrency - 
bitcoin - "has reached an absolute historical maximum 
and is already approaching the mark of 51000 dollars. for 
1 BTC (exceeding the price of a troy ounce  of gold)".  
States face new regulatory challenges cryptocurrency 
transactions and other products of blockchain 
technologies, using positive sides with acceptable risks, 
embedding these blockchain innovations in current 
financial and legal system. Prohibiti on or permission, as 
well as complete ignoring is just a disclaimer.  
2. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  
To solve the set tasks, the following methods were 
used: system and comparative analysis, synthesis, 
analysis of statistical data, deduction.  
Publications, scienti fic publications, and textbooks 
were used as an information base for the study.  
This study is a quantitative research to have a better 
understanding of crypto -currency speculative bitcoin 
price drivers. Firstly, some empirical analyses.  
 The basic goal of  this study is to explore the 
knowledge of people about blockchain and the way this 
network works. This paper also covers some points of 
blockchain generations like bitcoin. In first section, the 
literature review has been discussed. A small knowledge 
abou t blockchain and its generations (bitcoin, ethereum) 
is mentioned. Then comparison of blockchain, bitcoin 
related to some aspect has been shown in form of table. 
Then result of comparison is discussed. At last, 
conclusion of whole study is defined.  
3. RESE ARCH RESULTS  
Taking these prerequisites into account, the use  
cryptocurrencies and blockchain  technologies have become 
one of the responses to the opportunities and challenges of the 
development of the world economy, incl. related to 
imperfection of state and market regulation:  cryptocurrency is 
a product of the digital economy; when creating a 
cryptocurrency, algorithms based on objective mathematical 
laws are used;  control over the circulation of cryptocurrencies 
is carried out by the system itself, which makes it more stable 
in relation to the actions of third parties;  cryptocurrencies can 
reduc e transaction co sts; cryptocurrencies are an international 
product created in the interests of and to serve all participants in 
the settlement. Despite the technical limitations and difficulties 
associated with mining and the circulation of cryptocurrencie s 
(low transaction processing speed, the risk  [2] of system 
stability, etc.), individual states are already experimenting with 
digital money, as well as blockchain technology  [3]. However, 
the significance of the prospects for using cryptocurrencies for 
citizens, government and business is different.  While a dynamic cryptocurrency market can revolutionize 
the way money is exchanged, its introduction to global 
platforms can be fraught with problems and potential errors. 
Since virtual currencies are not gener ally accepted as official 
means of payment for goods and services, developing 
standardized systems for their use is critical. For currencies to 
be stable, it is necessary to establish their legal status. 
Regulatory systems are evolving and different govern ments are 
taking a variety of approaches. The current regulatory measures 
are in their primary state and continue to evolve along with the 
booming cryptographic means of payment industry.  
From the point of view of business, this is, first of all, 
a differe nt format of interaction between economic 
agents with a reduction in the number of intermediaries 
represented by banks, state and quasi -state institutions. In 
practice, this means minimizing bureaucratic formalities 
for making settlements, increasing the s peed of providing 
services, and reducing the cost of transactions. The 
irreversibility of transactions can be of particular value in 
comparison with the possibility of canceling any banking 
transaction or challenging and terminating transactions in 
court. The issuance of cryptocurrencies, digital signs 
(tokens) is also considered as a convenient way to attract 
private investments to finance the launch and / or 
financial support of current business projects.  
Individuals approach cryptocurrencies and 
blockchain from various aspects: cheap in strument for 
large settlements; earning income through investments in 
the purchase of cryptocurrency and mining.  
The growing interest of the population in 
cryptocurrency was largely due to the possibility of 
investin g money and obtaining superprofits due to the 
growth of cryptocurrency quotes (primarily bitcoin). At 
the same time, many experts believe that investing in 
digital money is a “financial pyramid”, and soon the 
financial bubble should burst or has already bu rst. The 
factors of the dynamics of the value of the cryptocurrency 
are poorly predictable, which is reflected in the 
significant jumps in the rate of the cryptocurrency in 
relation to fiat money. Despite the fact that the asset is 
not backed by real value , the potential profitability due to 
purchase and sale operations is very high, which makes 
investments in cryptocurrencies very risky and at the 
same time attractive for speculative capital. You can talk 
about the "overvalued" or "underestimated" of 
crypt ocurrencies, but at the same time it is necessary to 
understand that these terms are applicable to a greater 
extent to fiat money. For the state, this issue is more 
complicated than for other subjects of the economy. On 
the one hand, there is great potenti al for the development 
of financial technologies. The use of cryptocurrencies 
and blockchain technology can simplify and speed up 
interbank and interstate settlements, the issuance and 
circulation of debt securities, the identification 
procedure, reduce th e cost of transactions, ensure the 
security and convenience of transactions through the use

of cryptography. The potential for using blockchain 
technology is also significant from the point of view of 
providing public services (for example, in transactions  
with confirmation of property rights).  
The other side of the use of digital money [4] is 
related to the role of the state in the monetary system. 
Acting as the only issuer of legal banknotes, the state also 
controls the amount of money in the economy, its  
circulation and monetary inflation channels.  
Cryptocurrency services (Bitcoin, Litecoin, 
Ethereum, Dash, Monero, etc.) have made a powerful 
step forward in a short time. Now users do not have to 
lose money on transactions through intermediaries, 
paying in terest. You can use the crypto wallet on your 
computer or save money online on a specific service. 
However, it is better to keep money, third -party services 
often break, and everything is lost. It is logical to 
download the necessary software from the site  (for 
example, from "Bitcoin") and install it on your computer 
based on the operating system  [5]. It is better to choose 
full versions, rather than "light" options - it requires disk 
space, time and traffic, but this option is more reliable.  
Cryptocurrency  in Ukraine can be earned, bought or 
donated. It used to be easier to earn it, in 2017 the 
situation changed [6 ]. In Ukraine, "it is problematic to 
pay with cryptocurrency for goods or services, only units 
of online stores and businesses indicate on their sites that 
accept cryptocurrency as p ayment for goods or 
services"  [7]. The business owner can use the payment in 
a new type of curren cy, as do many Western stores [ 8]. 
In some countries, employers are already paying their 
employees in cryptocurrency, usua lly to those who work 
online - in Ukraine, this practice is just beginning to 
spread. Wages in cryptocurrencies among Ukrainians 
today are mostly received by IT specialists working for 
foreign companies.  
Sometimes cryptocurrency can be earned for free: it is a 
small amount of gift that attracts people around the world. All 
you have to do is enter a captcha or view an advertisement, 
and for this you will be charged, for example, Satoshi (one 
hundred million bitcoin). But this is not a normal way to earn 
mone y, because if the site is blocked, the cryptocurrency 
disappears. Gifts are possible from large services, for 
example, for a good post or article, a picture that is in demand 
among other users [ 9]. 
You can buy cryptocurrency in Ukraine on various 
exchanges, in exchangers. Exchangers are not always 
profitable, because they earn on the difference in value, 
the best options are with exchanges or buying directly 
from a seller with a good reputation [ 7]. It is important to 
remember the security of the t ransaction;  many 
practitioners [ 6; 3] recommend buying cryptocurrency 
from sellers in their city.  The process of creating a new payment instrument, 
which is cryptocurrencies, "uses the computer power of 
millions of participants, based on data from open e -
wallets" [ 10], which are combined into one peer -to-peer 
network in the absence of a central server. Thus, all work 
on accounting, storage of transaction history is 
distributed among all participants [ 11]. 
One of the most important aspects of the functioning  
of cryptocurrency is powerful modern cryptographic 
methods of protection that provide identification of 
owners and recording the fact of their change. Belief in 
the impossibility of breaking this protection seems to us 
somewhat idealistic without the prop er constant IT 
support of specialists  [12]. 
Given the current situation in Ukraine, ignoring the 
cryptocurrency market by the state is not a productive 
way to resolve the situation  [13]. In our  opinion, it is 
constructive to consider this phenomenon as an 
alternative to the existing system or as a supplement to it.  
At the beginning of 2017, the most common 
cryptocurrencies in Ukraine were:  
Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency created, 
confi dently holding the palm of supremacy in the world 
and in the Ukrainian market. The pri ce of the coin is 
approaching 500 00 dollars. USA.  
Ethereum (ETH) is a cryptocurrency that was issued 
only in 2015 on the basis of Ethereum technology, which 
belongs to th e blockchain systems based on the use of 
distributed databases. Ethereum can be used in various 
fields, and is also a currency, an alternative to traditional 
instruments of the foreign exchange market. The price is 
about 1814  dollars. USA. Growing interest  in this 
cryptocurrency has been facilitated by the ability to trade 
the ETH / USD pair, the world's largest social trading and 
investment network eToro, as well as the blockchain of 
the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which includes 
Microsoft, Intel and Acc enture.  
Analysts attribute the record -breaking growth of the 
cryptocurrency Dash to the release of the update Dash v12.1 
- "Sentinel", designed to increase the speed of work, improve 
the levels of privacy and coordination in the network. The 
price of Dash today approached $ 1814 . USA.  
Monero (XMR) is an open source cryptocurrency that 
is secure and anonymous. Stably included in the top five 
coins with a high m arket capitalization. Price - 245 
dollars. USA.  
Ripple (XRP) is an open source payment system, 
wher e the internal payment unit is the cryptocurrency of 
the same name. Ripple technology is based on the 
"principle of trust". The idea is to be able to exchange 
your currency for any other at the best rate in one click, 
adding the r ight gateway. Price - $ 544. USA

To understand the collective concept of 
"cryptocurrency", it should be borne in mind that all non -
cash (electronic) money (traditional fiat currencies) is 
also digital - cashless dollar, euro, hryvnia, webmoney, 
yandexmoney. The only difference is t hat in one case, the 
issue is centralized and far from always effectively 
managed by the National Bank, a municipality, an 
ordinary commercial bank, a financial company, and in 
the other - by the management of the issue of alternative 
money decentralized a nd not burdened with loan interest, 
immobilization tax, commissions and fees of the issuer.  
4. DISCUSSION OF RESULT S 
Many scientists have devoted their work to the study 
of the problems of creating a unified world payment 
system. Discussions are being held  on ways to create an 
information society. Issues related to the further 
development of the digital economy as a digital 
ecosystem of the future society are also discussed. 
Research is being conducted on the impact of 
cryptocurrency technology on the finan cial side of the 
digital economy. The possibility of using blockchain 
technology as a unified digital platform for the digital 
economy of the future has been substantiated; the issue 
of expanding the scope of blockchain technology is being 
studied [ 1, p. 1 2]. 
Note that electronic payment instruments act as the 
newest variety of payment instruments, generated mainly 
by scientific and technological progress, rather than by 
the evolution of monetary and financial relations. At the 
same time, this term, like so me other concepts (for 
example, “electronic settlements”, “electronic money”, 
etc.) do not have an unambiguous a nd clear definition in 
theory [9 ]. The materials are devoted to the analysis of 
the main properties of cryptocurrencies using the 
example of bitcoin (Bitcoin), which have a significant 
impact on the economy in the XXI century, as well as the 
problems of licensing cryptocurrencies in Ukraine and 
ways to solve this problem.  
The competitiveness of modern banking structures 
operating in the market is directly dependent on the 
introduction of new banking technologies and products. 
Scientists give the characteristics of the bitcoin 
cryptocurrency, consider its advantages and 
disadvantages, as well as the specifics of bitcoin 
technology  [14]. 
According  to Santander -Bank, the use of a distributed 
ledger by banks will provide an opportunity to achieve 
significant savings on infrastructure (up to $ 20 billion 
annually by 2022). Such registries will be cheaper to 
operate than those in use today and will pre vent assets 
from being frozen for the hours or days that transfer 
transactions take today. The problems associated with the 
control over the turnover and emission of 
cryptocurrencies are considered in parallel with the concept of cryptocurrency and the gen eral properties of 
these currencies.  
As retailers around the world begin to formally 
respond to the virtual currency market, the scale of the 
currency's success ultimately depends on public 
acceptance. This path is not easy and will take a huge 
amount of e ffort to calm skeptical people. The physical 
value of a cryptocurrency lies in the number of its users. 
Without public trust, the virtual currency system as an 
alternative payment method will be unstable.  
Gradually, thanks to the information background tha t 
defends its dignity, the cryptocurrency is gaining a 
presence in the world market. However, despite the 
recent surge in media coverage, cryptocurrencies are still 
widely unknown to the wider population of the planet. 
This trend is indicative of skepticis m about Bitcoin's 
usefulness.  
5. CONCLUSIONS  
So, at present there are over a thousand different 
cryptocurrencies that require the development of a single 
standard for their regulation, adaptation of legislation in 
the tax area, as well as identification of  cryptocurrencies 
to generate income.  
In the process of regulating cryptocurrencies, states 
strive to create a favorable climate for the development 
of new technologies (blockchain), seeing the enormous 
potential for the use of technologies in various sect ors of 
economic and social activity, as well as the potential for 
using cryptocurrencies for investment.  
Based on the research conducted, many authors see 
directions for further development in the study of the 
possibilities of legal regulation, the emissio n of a national 
cryptocurrency, as well as its use to finance targeted 
programs, taking into account its advantages.  
Cryptogrivna, which can be put into circulation, 
means the formation of new institutional conditions for 
the development and functioning of  the national financial 
market. At the same time, it is important to understand 
that cryptocurrency cannot completely replace traditional 
means of payment and payment methods, either in the 
medium or in the short term.  
In this regard, in order to ensure national economic 
security, the unification of the current tax and financial 
legislation with acts of international law, in terms of 
economic and organizational approaches to the 
circulation and emission of world and national 
cryptocurrencies, is of partic ular relevance. This will 
make it possible to create a number of new financial 
instruments that can be used to stimulate the growth of 
the national economy, which today is gradually emerging 
from the crisis zone, showing a trend towards further 
growth.
