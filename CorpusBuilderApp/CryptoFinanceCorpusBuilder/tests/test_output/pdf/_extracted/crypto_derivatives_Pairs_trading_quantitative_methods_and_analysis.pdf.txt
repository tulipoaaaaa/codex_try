Preface

M ost book readers are likely to concur with the idea that the least read

portion of any book is the preface. With that in mind, and the fact that
the reader has indeed taken the trouble to read up to this sentence, we prom-
ise to leave no stone unturned to make this preface as lively and entertain-
ing as possible. For your reading pleasure, here is a nice story with a picture
thrown in for good measure. Enjoy!

Once upon a time, there were six blind men. The blind men wished to
know what an elephant looked like. They took a trip to the forest and with
the help of their guide found a tame elephant. The first blind man walked
into the broadside of the elephant and bumped his head. He declared that
the elephant was like a wall. The second one grabbed the elephant’s tusk and
said it felt like a spear. The next blind man felt the trunk of the elephant and
was sure that elephants were similar to snakes. The fourth blind man hugged
the elephant’s leg and declared the elephant was like a tree. The next one
caught the ear and said this is definitely like a fan. The last blind man felt the
tail and said this sure feels like a rope. Thus the six blind men all perceived
one aspect of the elephant and were each right in their own way, but none
of them knew what the whole elephant really looked like.

PREFACE

Oftentimes, the market poses itself as the elephant. There are people
who say that predicting the market is like predicting the weather, because
you can do well in the short term, but where the market will be in the long
run is anybody’s guess. We have also heard from others that predicting the
market short term is a sure way to burn your fingers. “Invest for the long
haul” is their mantra. Some will assert that the markets are efficient, and yet
some others would tell you that it is possible to make extraordinary returns.
While some swear by technical analysis, there are some others, the so-called
fundamentalists, who staunchly claim it to be a voodoo science. Multiple
valuation models for equities like the dividend discount model, relative val-
uation models, and the Merton model (treating equity as an option on firm
value) all exist side by side, each being relevant at different times for dif-
ferent stocks. Deep theories from various disciplines like physics, statistics,
control theory, graph theory, game theory, signal processing, probability,
and geometry have all been applied to explain different aspects of market
behavior.

It  seems  as  if  the  market  is  willing  to  accommodate  a  wide  range  of
sometimes opposing belief systems. If we are to make any sense of this smor-
gasbord of opinions on the market, we would be well advised to draw com-
fort  from  the  story  of  the  six  blind  men  and  the  elephant.  Under  these
circumstances, if the reader goes away with a few more perspectives on the
market elephant, the author would consider his job well done.

CHAPTER 1
Introduction

W e start at the very beginning (a very good place to start). We begin with

the CAPM model.

THE CAPM MODEL

CAPM is an acronym for the Capital Asset Pricing Model. It was originally
proposed by William T. Sharpe. The impact that the model has made in the
area of finance is readily evident in the prevalent use of the word beta. In
contemporary finance vernacular, beta is not just a nondescript Greek let-
ter, but its use carries with it all the import and implications of its CAPM
definition.

Along with the idea of beta, CAPM also served to formalize the notion
of a market portfolio. A market portfolio in CAPM terms is a portfolio of
assets that acts as a proxy for the market. Although practical versions of
market portfolios in the form of market averages were already prevalent at
the time the theory was proposed, CAPM definitely served to underscore the
significance of these market averages.

Armed  with  the  twin  ideas  of  market  portfolio  and  beta,  CAPM  at-
tempts to explain asset returns as an aggregate sum of component returns.
In other words, the return on an asset in the CAPM framework can be sep-
arated into two components. One is the market or systematic component,
and the other is the residual or nonsystematic component. More precisely, if
rp is the return on the asset, rm is the return on the market portfolio, and the
beta of the asset is denoted as b, the formula showing the relationship that
achieves the separation of the returns is given as

r
p

=

+β
r

(1.1)

Equation 1.1 is also often referred to as the security market line (SML). Note
that in the formula, brm is the market or systematic component of the return.
b serves as a leverage number of the asset return over the market return. For

BACKGROUND MATERIAL

instance, if the beta of the asset happens to be 3.0 and the market moves
1 percent, the systematic component of the asset return is now 3.0 percent.
This idea is readily apparent when the SML is viewed in geometrical terms
in Figure 1.1. It may also be deduced from the figure that b is indeed the
slope of the SML.

qp in the CAPM equation is the residual component or residual return
on the portfolio. It is the portion of the asset return that is not explainable
by the market return. The consensus expectation on the residual component
is assumed to be zero.

Having established the separation of asset returns into two components,
CAPM then proceeds to elaborate on a key assumption made with respect to
the relationship between them. The assertion of the model is that the mar-
ket  component  and  residual  component  are  uncorrelated.  Now,  many  a
scholarly discussion on the import of these assumptions has been conducted
and a lot of ink used up on the significance of the CAPM model since its in-
troduction. Summaries of those discussions may be found in the references
provided at the end of the chapter. However, for our purposes, the preced-
ing introduction explaining the notion of beta and its role in the determina-
tion of asset returns will suffice.

Given that knowledge of the beta of an asset is greatly valuable in the
CAPM context, let us discuss briefly how we can go about estimating its
value. Notice that beta is actually the slope of the SML. Therefore, beta may
be estimated as the slope of the regression line between market returns and
the asset returns. Applying the standard regression formula for the estima-
tion of the slope we have

that is, beta is the covariance between the asset and market returns divided
by the variance of the market returns.

To see the typical range of values that the beta of an asset is likely to as-
sume  in  practice,  we  remind  ourselves  of  an  oft-quoted  adage  about  the
markets, “A rising tide raises all boats.” The statement indicates that when
the market goes up, we can typically expect the price of all securities to go
up with it. Thus, a positive return for the market usually implies a positive
return for the asset, that is, the sum of the market component and the resid-
ual component is positive. If the residual component of the asset return is
small, as we expect it to be, then the positive return in the asset is explained
almost completely by its market component. Therefore, a positive return in
the market portfolio and the asset implies a positive market component of
the return and, by implication, a positive value for beta. Therefore, we can
expect all assets to typically have positive values for their betas.

MARKET NEUTRAL STRATEGY

Having  discussed  CAPM,  we  now  have  the  required  machinery  to  define
market neutral strategies: They are strategies that are neutral to market re-
turns, that is, the return from the strategy is uncorrelated with the market re-
turn. Regardless of whether the market goes up or down, in good times and
bad the market neutral strategy performs in a steady manner, and results are
typically achieved with a lower volatility. This desired outcome is achieved
by trading market neutral portfolios. Let us therefore define what we mean
by a market neutral portfolio.

In the CAPM context, market neutral portfolios may be defined as port-
folios whose beta is zero. To examine the implications, let us apply a beta
value of zero to the equation for the SML. It is easy to see that the return on
the portfolio ceases to have a market component and is completely deter-
mined by qp, the residual component. The residual component by the CAPM
assumption happens to be uncorrelated with market returns, and the port-
folio return is therefore neutral to the market. Thus, a zero beta portfolio
qualifies as a market neutral portfolio.

In working with market neutral portfolios, the trader can now focus on
forecasting and trading the residual returns. Since the consensus expectation
or mean on the residual return is zero, it is reasonable to expect a strong
mean-reverting  behavior  (value  oscillates  back  and  forth  about  the  mean

ch_01_4273.qxd  6/24/04  1:17 PM  Page 6

BACKGROUND MATERIAL

value) of the residual time series.1 This mean-reverting behavior can then be
exploited in the process of return prediction, leading to trading signals that
constitute the trading strategy.

Let  us  now  examine  how  we  can  construct  market  neutral  portfolios
and what we should expect by way of the composition of such portfolios.
Consider a portfolio that is composed of strictly long positions in assets. We
expect  that  beta  of  the  assets  to  be  positive.  Then  positive  returns  in  the
market result in a positive return for the assets and thereby a positive return
for the portfolio. This would, of course, imply a positive beta for the port-
folio. By a similar argument it is easy to see that a portfolio composed of
strictly short positions is likely to have a negative beta. So, how do we con-
struct a zero beta portfolio, using securities with positive betas? This would
not be possible without holding both long and short positions on different
assets in the portfolio. We therefore conclude that one can typically expect
a zero beta portfolio to comprise both long and short positions. For this rea-
son, these portfolios are also called long–short portfolios. Another artifact of
long–short portfolios is that the dollar proceeds from the short sale are used
almost entirely to establish the long position, that is, the net dollar value of
holdings  is  close  to  zero.  Not  surprisingly,  zero  beta  portfolios  are  also
sometimes referred to as dollar neutral portfolios.

Example

Let us consider two portfolios A and B, with positive betas bA and bB and
with returns rA and rB

We now construct a portfolio AB, by taking a short position on r units of
portfolio A and a long position on one unit of portfolio B. The return on this
portfolio is given as rAB = –r.rA + rB. Substituting for the values of rA and rB,
we have

1The assertion of CAPM that the expected value of residual return is zero is rather
strong. It has been discussed extensively in academic literature as to whether this pre-
diction of CAPM is indeed observable. It is therefore recommended that we explic-
itly verify the mean-reverting behavior of the spread time series. In later chapters we
will discuss methods to statistically check for mean-reverting behavior.

ch_01_4273.qxd  6/24/04  1:17 PM  Page 7

Thus, the combined portfolio has an effective beta of –rbA + bB. This value
becomes zero, when r = bB/bA. Thus, by a judicious choice of the value of r
in the long–short portfolio we have created a market neutral portfolio.

COCKTAIL CORNER

In  cocktail  situations  involving  investment  professionals,  it  is  fairly
common to hear the terms long–short, market neutral, and dollar neu-
tral investing bandied about. Very often they are assumed to mean the
same thing. Actually, that need not be the case. You could be long–
short and dollar neutral but still have a nonzero beta to the market. In
which  case  you  have  a  nonzero  market  component  in  the  portfolio
return and therefore are not market neutral.

If you ever encountered such a situation, you could smile to your-
self. Tempting as it might be, I strongly urge that you restrain yourself.
But, of course, if you are looking to be anointed the “resident nerd,”
you could go ahead and launch into an exhaustive explanation of the
subtle  differences  to  people  with  cocktails  in  hand  not  particularly
looking for a lesson in precise terminology.

PAIRS TRADING

BACKGROUND MATERIAL

Pairs  trading  is  a  market  neutral  strategy  in  its  most  primitive  form.  The
market neutral portfolios are constructed using just two securities, consist-
ing of a long position in one security and a short position in the other, in a
predetermined ratio. At any given time, the portfolio is associated with a
quantity called the spread. This quantity is computed using the quoted prices
of the two securities and forms a time series. The spread is in some ways re-
lated to the residual return component of the return already discussed. Pairs
trading involves putting on positions when the spread is substantially away
from its mean value, with the expectation that the spread will revert back.
The positions are then reversed upon convergence. In this book, we will look
at two versions of pairs trading in the equity markets; namely, statistical ar-
bitrage pairs and risk arbitrage pairs.

Statistical arbitrage pairs trading is based on the idea of relative pricing.
The underlying premise in relative pricing is that stocks with similar char-
acteristics must be priced more or less the same. The spread in this case may
be thought of as the degree of mutual mispricing. The greater the spread, the
higher the magnitude of mispricing and greater the profit potential.

The strategy involves assuming a long–short position when the spread is
substantially away from the mean. This is done with the expectation that the
mispricing is likely to correct itself. The position is then reversed and prof-
its  made  when  the  spread  reverts  back.  This  brings  up  several  questions:
How  do  we  go  about  calculating  the  spread?  How  do  we  identify  stock
pairs for which such a strategy would work? What value do we use for the
ratio in the construction of the pairs portfolio? When can we say that the
spread  has  substantially  diverged  from  the  mean?  We  will  address  these
questions and provide some quantitative tools to answer them.

Risk arbitrage pairs occur in the context of a merger between two com-
panies. The terms of the merger agreement establish a strict parity relation-
ship between the values of the stocks of the two firms involved. The spread
in this case is the magnitude of the deviation from the defined parity rela-
tionship. If the merger between the two companies is deemed a certainty,
then the stock prices of the two firms must satisfy the parity relationship,
and the spread between them will be zero. However, there is usually a cer-
tain level of uncertainty on the successful completion of a merger after the
announcement, because of various reasons like antitrust regulatory issues,
proxy battles, competing bidders, and the like. This uncertainty is reflected
in a nonzero value for the spread. Risk arbitrage involves taking on this un-
certainty as risk and capturing the spread value as profits. Thus, unlike the
case of statistical arbitrage pairs, which is based on valuation considerations,
risk  arbitrage  trade  is  based  strictly  on  a  parity  relationship  between  the
prices of the two stocks.

ch_01_4273.qxd  6/24/04  1:17 PM  Page 9

Introduction

The typical modus operandi is as follows. Let us call the acquiring firm
the “bidder” and the acquired firm the “target.” On the eve of merger an-
nouncement,  the  bidder  shares  are  sold  short  and  the  target  shares  are
bought. The position is then unwound on completion of the merger. The
spread on merger completion is usually lower than when it was put on. The
realized profit is the difference between the two spreads. In this book, we
discuss how the ratio is determined based on the details of the merger agree-
ment. We will develop a model for the spread dynamics that can be used to
answer  questions  like,  “What  is  the  market  expectation  on  the  odds  of
merger completion?” We shall also demonstrate how the model may be used
for risk management. Additionally, we will focus on trade timing and pro-
vide some quantitative tools for the process.

OUTLINE

The book provides an overview of two different versions of pairs trading in
the equity markets. The first version is based on the idea of relative valua-
tion  and  is  called  statistical  arbitrage  pairs  trading.  The  second  involves
pairs trading that arises in the context of mergers and is called risk arbitrage.
Even though they are commonly called arbitrage strategies in the industry,
they are by no means risk-free. In this book we take an in-depth look at the
various aspects of these strategies and provide quantitative tools to assist in
their analysis.

I must also quickly point out at this juncture that the methodologies dis-
cussed in the book are not by any measure to be construed as the only way
to trade pairs because, to put it proverbially, there is more than one way to
skin a cat. We do, however, strive to present a compelling point of view at-
tempting to integrate theory and practice. The book is by no means meant
to be a guarantee for success in pairs trading. However, it provides a frame-
work and insights on applying rigorous analysis to trading pairs in the eq-
uity markets.

The book is in three parts. In the first part, we present preliminary ma-
terial on some key topics. We concede that there are books entirely devoted
to each of the topics addressed, and the coverage of the topics here is not ex-
haustive. However, the discussion sets the context for the rest of the book
and  helps  familiarize  the  reader  with  some  important  ideas.  It  also  intro-
duces some notation and definitions. The second part is devoted to statisti-
cal arbitrage pairs, and the third part is on risk arbitrage.

The book assumes some knowledge on the part of the reader of algebra,
probability theory, and calculus. Nevertheless, we have strived to make the
material accessible and the reader could choose to pick up the background
along the way. As a refresher, the appendix at the end of this chapter lists the
