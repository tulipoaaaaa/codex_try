          "formula": "FOREWORD\n‘The great bull market in stocks has led to an equally great bull market in the number of books\npublished on the subject of how to make money trading the markets. Many ideas abound, some good,\nsome not, Some original, some just a repackaging of earlier works. Occasionally, though, a writer\n‘comes forward with something that really sets him or her apart from the pack, something special. One\nsuch writer is Mark Douglas. Mark Douglas, in Trading in the Zone, has written a book that is the\naccumulation of years of thought and research—the work of a lifetime —and for those of us who view\ntrading as a profession, he has produced a gem.\nTrading in the Zone is an in-depth look at the challenges that we face when we take up the challenge of\ntrading. To the novice, the only challenge appears to be to find a way to make money. Once the novice\nTeams that tips, brokers advice, and other ways to justify buying or selling do not work consistently, he\ndiscovers that he either needs to develop a reliable trading strategy or purchase one. After that, trading\nshould be easy, right? All you have to do is follow the rules, and the money will all nto your lp.\nAL this point, if not before, novices discover that trading can turn into one of the most frustrating\nexperiences they will ever face\n‘This experience leads tothe oft-started statistic that 95 percent of futures trades lose all oftheir money\nWithin the frst year of trading. Stock traders generally experience the same results, which is why\npundits always point to the fact that most stock traders fail to outperform a simple buy and hold\ninvestment scenario,\nSo, why do people, the majority of whom are extremely successful in other occupations, fail so\nmiserably as traders? Are successful traders born and not made? Mark Douglas says no. What's\nnecessary, he says, is thatthe individual acquire the trader's mindset. It sounds easy, but the fact is, this\nmindset is very foreign when compared with the way our life experiences teach us to think about the\nworld\n‘That 95-percent failure rate makes sense when you consider how most of us experience life, using\nskills learned as we grow. When it comes to trading, however, it tums out that the skills we learn to\narm high marks in school, advance our careers, and ereate relationships with other peopl, the skills we\nare taught that should carry us through life, tum out to be inappropriate for wading. Traders, we find\n‘out, must learn to think in terms of probabilities and to surrender all ofthe skills we have acquired to\nachieve in virally every other aspect of our lives. In Trading in the Zone, Mark Douglas teaches us\nhow. He has put together a very valuable book. His sources are his own personal experiences as a\nleader, a traders coach in Chicago, author, and lecturer in his field of trading psychology\nMy recommendation? First see how o trading community looks like and then Enjoy Douglas's Trading\nin the Zone and, in doing so, develop a trader's mindset",

But the trading community didnt accept technical analysis as a viable tool for making\n‘money until the late 1970s oF early 1980s.

In other words,\nindividuals develop behavior pattems, and a group of individuals, interacting with one another on &\n‘consistent basis, form collective behavior patterns. These behavior pattems are observable and\n‘quantifiable, and they repeat themselves with statistical reliability. Technical analysis is a method that\n‘organizes this collective behavior into identifiable patterns that can give a elear indication of when\nthere isa greater probability of one thing happening over another. In a sense, technical analysis allows\nYou to get into the mind of the market to anticipate what's likely to happen next, based on the kind of\npatterns the market generated at some previous moment,\n‘As a method for projecting future price movement, echnical analysis has tured out to be far superior\n1o a purely fundamental approach. It keeps the trader focused on what the market is doing nov in\nrelation to what it has done in the pas, instead of focusing on what the market should be doing based\nsolely on what is logical and reasonable as determined by a mathematical model. On the other hand\nfundamental analysis ereates what I call a \"reality gap\" between \"what should be\" and \"what is.” The\nreality gap makes it extremely difficult to make anything but very long-term predictions that ean be\ndifficult wo exploit, even if they are correct.\nIn contrast, technical analysis not only closes this reality gap, but also makes available to the trader a\nVirtually unlimited number of possibilities to take advantage of. The technieal approach opens up many\nmore possibilities because it identifies how the same repeatable behavior patterns occur in every time\nframe—moment-tomoment, daily, weekly, yearly, and every time span in between. In other words,\ntechnical analysis tums the masket into an endless stream of opportunities to enrich oneself.\n\n‘THE SHIFT TO MENTAL ANALYSIS\n\nI technical analysis works so well, why would more and more of the trading community shift dheie\nfocus from technical analysis of the market to mental analysis of themselves, meaning their own\nindividual trading psychology?

Ths is called an objective perspective—one that is not skewed or distorted by what\nYou are afraid is going to happen or not happen.\n\nTm sure there isn't one trader reading this book who hasn't gotten into trades too soon—before the\n‘market has actually generated a signal, or too late—long after the market has generated a signal. What\ntrader hasnt convinced himself not to take a loss and, as a result, hd it turn into a bigger one: oF got\n‘out of winning trades to soon; or found himself in winning trades but didnt take any profits at all, and\nthen let the trades tur into losers; or moved stoplosses closer to his entry point, only to get stopped out\nand have the market go back in his direction? These are but a few ofthe many errors traders perpetuate\nupon themselves time and time again, These are not market-generated errors. That is, these errs do\nnot come from the market. The market is neutral, inthe sense that it moves and generates information\nabout itself, Movement and information provide each of us with the opportunity to do something, but\nthat’ all! The markets don't have any power over the unique way in which each of us perceives and\ninterprets this information, or control of the decisions and actions we take as a result. The errors I\nalready mentioned and many more are strictly the result of what I call faulty trading attitudes and\nperspectives.” Faull altitudes that foster fear instead of tust and confidence.\n\ndon’ think I could put the difference between the consistent winners and everyone else more simply\nthan this: The best traders aren't afraid. They aren't afraid because they have developed attitudes that\ngive them the greatest degree of mental flexibility to flow in and out of trades based on what the market\nis telling them about the possiblities from its perspective. AL the same time, the best traders have\n‘developed attitudes that prevent them from getting reckless, Everyone else is afraid, to some degree or\nanother. When they're not afraid, they have the tendency to become reckless and to create the kind of\n‘experience for themselves that will cause them to be afraid from that point on\n\nNinety-five percent of the trading errors you are likely to make—causing the money to just evaporate\nbefore your eyes—will stem from your atitudes about being wrong, losing money, missing out, and\nleaving money on the table. What I call the four primary trading fears.\n\nNow, you may be saying to yourself, \"I don't know about this: I've always thought traders should have\nhealthy fear ofthe markets.\" Again, this isa perfectly logical and reasonable assumption. But when it\n‘comes to trading, your Fears will act against you in such a way that you will eause the very thing you\nare afraid of to actually happen. If you're afraid of being wrong, your fear will act upon your perception\n‘of market information in a way that will cause you to do something that ends up making you wrong.\nWhen you are fearful, no other possibilities exist. You can't perceive other possiblities or at on them\nproperly, even if'you did manage fo perceive them, because fear is immobilizing. Physically, it causes\nus to freeze or run. Mentally, it causes us to narrow our focus of attention tothe object of our fear. This",

My personal theory is that needs and desires\n‘reate mental vacuums, The universe in which we live has @ natural tendency to not tolerate a vacuum\nand moves to fill it, whenever one exists. (The philosopher Spinoza observed centuries ago that\n\"Nature abbors a vacuum”)\n\nSuck the air out of a bottle and your tongue and lips will stick to the mouth ofthe bottle, because you\nhave created an imbalance (a vacuum), which now must be filled.

The thoughts, in\nlum, ean inspire movement and expression that result inthe fulfillment of that need\n\nIn this respect, I think our mental environment works like the universe at large. Once we recognize a\nneed or desire, we move to fill the vacuum with an experience in the exterior environment. If we are\ndenied the opportunity to pursue the object of this need or desire, it literally feels as if we are not\n\\whole, or that something is missing, which puts us into a state of imbalance or emotional pain.

The unlimited\ncharacteristics of the trading environment require that we act with some degree of restraint and self-\n‘control, at least if we want to create some measure of consistent suecess. The structure we need to\nguide our behavior has to originate in your mind, asa conscious act of free will.

Quite the contraty, its usually very subtle. We agree on the one\nhand that rules make sense, but we really have no intention of doing whatever is being suggested. This\nresistance can be intense, and i has logical source\nMost of the structure in our minds was given to us as a result of our social upbringing and based on\n‘choices made by other people. In other words, it was instilled in our minds, but did not originate in our\nminds. This is a very important distinction. Inthe process of instilling structure, many of our natural\nimpulses to move, express, and learn about the nature of our existence through our own direct\n‘experience were denied. Many of these denied impulses were never reconciled and sill exist inside of\nus as frustration, anger, disappointment, guilt, or even hatred. The accumulation of these negative\nfeelings acts as a force inside our mental environment eausing us to resist anything that denies us the\nfreedom to do and be whatever we want, when we wast",

Earlier, I said that when you don't take responsibility, one of the major psychological\n‘obstacles that ean block your success is that you will mislead yourself into believing that your trading\nproblems and lack of consistency can be rectified through market analysis. To illustrate this point, let's\ngo back to our novice trader who started out witha carefree state of mind until he experienced his first,\nloss. After winning with such ease and effortlessness, the abrupt shift to emotional pain can be quite\nshocking-—not shocking enough, however, to quit trading.

For traders, the only way to extract that revenge is\nto conquer the market, and the only way to conquer the market i through market knowledge, or so they\nthink. In other words, the underlying reason for why the novice trader is learning about the market is 10\n‘overcome the market, to prove something to it and himself, and most important, to prevent the market\nfrom busting him again, He is not learning the market simply as a means to give himself a systematic\n\\way of winning, but rather as a way to either avoid pain or prove something that has absolutely nothing\nto do with looking atthe market from an objective perspective. He doesn't realize it, but 3s Soon as he\nmade the assumption that knowing something about the market can prevent him from experiencing\npain or can help satisfy his desire for revenge or o prove something, he sealed his fate to become a\nloser.\n\nIncffect what he has done is set up an irreconcilable dilemma,\n\nHe is learning how to recognize and understand the market's collective behavior patterns, and that's\ngood. It even feels good, He's inspired because he assumes he's learning about the market in order to\nbecome a winner. As a result, he will typically go on a knowledge quest, learning about trend ines,\n‘chart pattems, support and resistance, candlesticks, market profiles, point and line charts, Elliott waves,\nFibonacei retracements, oscillators, relative strength, stochasties, and many more technical tools too",

Therefore, you can't assume that\nyou have the capacity to give yourself an unlimited amount of money just because you have learned\nhow to trade and the money is there for the taking.\n\nA futures broker at one of the major brokerage firms once commented that when it comes to his\n‘eustomers, he lives by the motto that all commodity traders are terminal, and iti his job to keep them\nhappy until they're gone. He said this facetiously, but there is alot of truth fo his statement. Obviously,\nif you lose more money than you make, you can't survive. What's less obvious, and one of the\nmysteries of being suecessful, is that if you win, you may sil be terminal; that is, if you win and you\nhaven't learned how to create a healthy balance between confidence and restraint, or you haven't\nlearned how to recognize and compensate for any potential you have to self-destruct, you will sooner oF\nlater lose.\n\nI you are among those in the boom-and-bust cycle, consider this: If you could redo every losing trade\nthat was the result of an error or recklessness, how much money would you have now? Based on these\nrecalculated results, what would your equity curve look like? I'm sure many of you would fall into the\n‘category of consistent winners. Now think about how you responded to your losses when they\n‘occurred, Did you assume complete responsibility for them? Did you ty to identify how you might\nchange your perspective, attitude, ot behavior? Or did you look to the market and wonder what you\nmight eam about i to prevent such a thing from happening again? Obviously, the market has nothing\ntodo with your potential for recklessness, nor does it have anything to do with the erors you make as a\nresult of some internal conflict about deserving the money.\n\nProbably one of the hardest concepts for traders to effectively assimilate is that the market doesn't\n‘reate your attitude or state of mind: it simply acts as a misror reflecting whats inside back to you. If\nyou are confident, i's not because the market is making you feel that way; itis because your belies and\ntliiudes are aligned in a way that allows you to step forward into an experience, take responsibility for\nthe outcome, and extract the insight that's been made available. You maintain your confident state of\nrind simply because you are constantly learning. Conversely, if you're angiy and afraid, i's because\nyou believe to some degree that the market creates your outcomes, not the other way around.\nUltimately, the worst consequence of not taking responsibility is that it keeps you ina eyele of pain and\ndissatisfaction, Think about it for a moment. If you're not responsible for your results, then you can\nassume there's nothing for you to earn, and you can stay exactly as you are\n\n‘You won't grow and you won't change. AS a result, you will perceive events in exactly the same way,\nand therefore respond to them in the same way, and get the same dissatisfying results. Or, you might\nalso assume the solution to your problems is to guin more market knovledge.

Doing\nthis effectively will require an understanding ofthe nature of mental energy and how you can use that\n‘energy to change a perspective that is generating an unwanted, negative, emotional response to market\ninformation. There's much to learn, but I dhink you will be amazed at how some simple changes can\nmake a huge difference in your trading resulls. The process of trading starts with perceiving an\n‘opportunity. Without the perception of an opportunity, we wouldn't have a reason to trade. So Think it\nis only Giting that we start our examination of mental energy by breaking down the process of\nperception,\nWhat are the underlying dynamics of perception? What factors determine how we perceive information\n‘or what we perceive in relationship to what is available? How is perception connected with what we\n‘experience at any given moment? Probably the easiest way to understand the dynamics of perception\nand answer these questions is to think of everything (and I do tion of forces—forves that generate\ninformation about the properties, characteristics, and traits that make them uniguely what they are.\nEverything that exists outside of our bodies—all plants and all categories of life: all planetary\nphenomena in the form of weather conditions, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions; all active and inert,\nphysical matter; and all noncorporeal phenomena such as light, sound waves, microwaves, and\nradiation—generates information about the nature o its existence. That information has the potential to\ntot as a force on one of our five physical senses. Before we go any further, notice that I use the verb\n™ generate” in an all-inclusive way implying that everything is in an active state of expression, including\ninanimate objects\nTo illustrate why I do that let's look at something as simple as a rock. Its an inanimate object,\n‘composed of unique atoms and molecules expressing themselves as a rock. I can use the active verb\n\"expressing\" because the atoms and molecules that make up the rock are in constant motion. So, even\nthough the rock doesn't appear active except in the most abstract sense, it has characteristics and\nproperties that will act as forces on our senses, causing us to experience and make distinctions about\nthe nature ofits existence. For example, a rock has texture, and that texture acts as a force on our sense\n‘of touch if we run our fingers across the rock's surface.\n‘A rock has shape and color, which act asa force on our vision; the rock takes up space that no other\n‘object can occupy, so that we see it instead of an empty space or some other object. A rock can also\nhave an odor that acts asa force on our sense of smell, o taste like something, although I haven't licked\nany rocks lately to find out. When we encounter anything in the envionment that expresses its\nproperties and characteristic, an exchange of energy takes place. Energy from the outside, in the form\n‘of whatever is expressing itself, gets transformed by our nervous system into electrical impulses and\nthen gets stored in our inner, mental environment. To be more specific, whatever we are seeing\nhearing, tasting, smelling, or feeling through our senses gets transformed into electrical impulses of",

He can only experience them if the pesson to whom the\nmemories belong is alive and chooses to express them in some way. If memories, distintions, and\nbeliefs don't exist as physical matter, then there really isn't any allerative way for them to exist except\n1s some form of energy.

Now, if you\ntake a moment and think about it, some of what I just said should be self-evident. For example, there\nare many ways in which the external environment can express itself that we don't perceive simply\nbecause we haven't leamed about them yet\n\n‘This is easy to illustrate. Think back to the firs time you ever looked at a prive chart. What did you\nsee? Exactly what did you perceive?

Now if you're like most traders, when you look ata price chart\nyou see characteristics, traits, and behavior patterns that represent the collective actions of all the\ntraders who participated in those particular trades. Initially, the chart represented undifferentiated\ninformation, Undifferentiated information usually eretes a state of confusion, and that's probably what\nyou experienced when you first encountered a chat.\n\nGradually, however, you learned to make distinctions about that information, such as trends and trend\nlines, consolidations, support and resistance, retraeements or significant relationships between volume,\nand open interest and price action, just to name a few. You learned that each of these distinetions in the\nmarket s behavior represented an opportunity 10 fulfill some personal need, goal, or desire. Each\nistinetion now had a meaning and some relative degree of significance or importance attached to it\nNow, I want you to use your imagination and pretend that I just set before you the very frst price chart\nyou ever saw. Would there be a difference between what you see now and what you saw then?\nAbsolutely. Instead of a bunch of undifferentiated lines, you would see everything you've learned about\nthose lines between then and now. In other words, you would see all the distinctions you've learned 10\nmake, as wel a all the opportunities those distinctions represent,\n\nYet, everything you can see as you look at that chart now existed then, and, furthermore, was available\nlo be perceived, What's the difference? The structured energy that's inside of you now—the knowledge\nyou have gained—acts as a force on your eyes, causing you to recognize the various distinctions that\nyou've learned about, Since that energy wasn’ there the fist time you looked at the chat, all the\n‘opportunities that you now see were there, but atthe same time invisible to you. Furthermore, unless\nyouve learned to make every possible distinction based on every possible relationship between the\nVariables in that chart, what you haven't leamed yet is sill invisible.

To illustrate this concept and make it even clearer, I am going to give you\nanother example, one that demonstrates how mental energy can affect how we perceive and experience\nthe environment in a way tha it actually reverses the cause-and-effect relationship. Let's look ata very\nyoung childs first encounter with a dog. Because it's a first-time experience, the child's mental\n‘environment is a clean slate, so 10 speak, with respect to dogs. He won't have any memories and\ncertainly no distinctions about a dog's nature. Therefore, up to the moment of his first encounter, from\nthe child's perspective, dogs don't exist. OF course, from the environment’ perspective, dogs do exist\nand they have the potential (0 act as a force on the child's senses to create an experience. In other\nwords, dogs expressing their nature ean act as a cause to produce an effect inside the child's mental\n‘environment, What kind of effect are dogs capable of producing? Well, dogs have a range of\nexpression, By range of expression I mean dogs ean behave in a number of ways toward humans.\n\n‘They can be fiendly, loving, protective, and fun to play with; or they can be hostile, mean, and\ndangerous—just to name a few of the many behaviors they'e capable of. All of these traits can be\n‘observed, experienced, and leaned about. When the child sees the dog for the frst time, there is\nabsolutely nothing in his mental environment to tell him what be is dealing with, Unfamiliar, unknown,\nand unclassified environmental information can generate a sense of curiosity —when we want to find\n‘out more about what we're experiencing—or it can generate a slate of confusion, which can easily turn\nlo fear if we can't place the information into an understandable or meaningful organizational\nframework or context. In our example, the child's sense of curiosity kicks in and he rushes to the dog to\ngel more sensory experience.\n\nNotice how children ate literally compelled to thrust themselves into a situation they know nothing\nabout, However, in this example, the environmental forces at hand do not react favorably tothe child's\nadvances, The dog the child is interested in is either inherently mean or having a bad day. In any case\n238 Soon as the child gets close enough, the dog bites him. The attack is so severe thatthe dog hus to be\npulled off the child. This kind of unfortunate experience is certainly not typical, but it's not that\nuncommon either. Ichose it for two reasons: First, most people can relate to it in some way either from\ntheir own direct experience or through the experience of someone they know. Second, as we analyze\nthe underlying dynamies ofthis experience from an energy perspective, we're going to learn about\n\n1) how our minds are designed to think,\n\n2) process information,\n\n3) how these processes affect what we experience and.\n\n4) our ability to recognize new possiblities.",

That painful energy then gets\nreflected back 10 him, so that he perceives a dog that is threatening, painful, and dangerous. This\nprocess makes the second dog identical in character, properties, and Waits to the one that is in the boy's\nmemory bank, even though the information the second dog is generating about its behavior is not\nidentical, or even similar, to the behavior ofthe dog that actually attacked the boy\n\nSince the two dogs, the one in the boy's mind and the one outside of the boy's mind, fel exactly the\nsame its extremely unlikely the boy will be able to make any type of distinetions inthe second dog's\nbehavior that would suggest to him that itis any different than the one in his mind.

If you focus on each hand individually, there will be a\nrandom, unpredictable distibution between winning and losing hands. But on a collective basis, just\nthe opposite is true. Ifa large enough number of hands is played, patterns will emerge that produce a\nconsistent, predictable, and statistically reliable outcome.\n\nHere's what makes thinking in probabilities so difficult. It requires two layers of beliefs that on the\nsurface seem to contradict each other. We'll call the first layer the micro level. At this level, you have\nto believe in the uncertainty and unpredictability of each individual hand. You know the truth of this\nuncertainty, because there are always a number of unknown variables affecting the consistency of the\n‘deck that each new hand is drawn from. For example, you can't know in advance how any of the other\nparticipants will decide to play their hands, sine they can either take or decline additional cards. Any\nvariables acting on the consistency of the deck that can't be controlled oF known in advance will make\nthe outcome of any particular and both uncertain and random (statistically independent) in\nrelationship to any other hand. The second layer is the macro level. At this level, you have to believe\nthat the outcome over a series of hands played is relatively certain and predictable. The degree of\ncertainly is based on the fixed or constant variables that are known in advance and specifically\ndesigned to give an advantage (edge) to one side or the other.\n\n‘The constant variables Iam referring to are the rules of the game. So, even though you don't or couldn't\nknow in advance (unless you are psychic) the sequence of wins to losses, you can be relatively certain\nthat if enough hands are played, whoever has the edge will end up with more wins than losses. The\ndegree of cestainty is a function of how good the edge is. Ids the ability to believe in the\nunpredictability of the game at the micro level and simultaneously believe in the predictability of the\ngame atthe macro level that makes the casino and the professional gambler effective and sucessful at\n‘hat they do, Their belie in the uniqueness of each hand prevents them from engaging in the pointless",

Firs, the trader, the gambler,\nand the casino are all dealing with both known and wnknown variables that affect the outcome of each\ntrade or gambling event. In gambling, the known variables are the rules of the game. In trading, the\nknown variables (from each individual trader's perspective) are the results of their market analysis.\n“Market analysis finds behavior patterns in the collective actions of everyone participating in a market.\nWe know that individuals will act the same way under similar situations and circumstances, over and\n‘over again, producing observable patterns of behavior.

But, ifthe consistency of the group of traders who are\n‘reating the paler \"now\" is different by even one person from the group that created the patter inthe\npast then the outcome of the current pattern has the potential to be different from the past pattern. (The\n‘example of the analyst and chairman illustrates this point quite well) It takes only one trader,\nsomewhere inthe world, with a different belief about the future to change the outcome of any particular\n‘market paler and negate the edge that pattern represents, The most fundamental characteristic of the\n‘market's behavior is that each “now moment” market situation, each “now moment” behavior pattern,\nand each \"now moment” edge is always a unique occurrence with its own outcome, independent of all\n‘others. Uniqueness implies that anything can happen, either what we know (expect or antiipate), or\nwhat we don't know (or can't know, unless we had extraordinary perceptual abilities).

Thinking in probabilities can be difficult to master, because our minds don't naturally\nprocess information in this manner. Quite the contrary, our minds cause us to perceive what we know,\nand what we know is part of our past, whereas, in the market, every moment is new and unique, even\nthough there may be similarities to something that occurred inthe past.

Shortly after attending the workshop, he called to ask\nme for some advice.

Almost immediately after he got out, the bellies went $00 points inthe direction of\nthis tade, but of course he was out of the market. He didn't understand what was going on.

By the\nway he described the situation, it sounded to me as if this is exactly what happened to him.

When you've trained your mind to think in probabilities, it means you have fully accepted\nall the possibilities (with no internal resistance or conflict) and you always do something to take the\nunknown forces into account, Thinkine this way is vitally impossible unless you've done the mental\nwork necessary to \"let go\" ofthe need to know what is going to happen next oF the need to be right on\n‘each trade.

To\nunderstand this concept, ask yourself what exactly about market information is uhreatening. Is it\nUreatening because the market actually expresses negatively charged information as an inherent\ncharacteristic of the way it exists?\n\n1 may seem that way, but at dhe most fundamental level, what the market gives us to perceive are\nUupties and down-ties or up-bars and down-bars. These up and dovin ties form pattems that represent\n‘edges. Now, are any ofthese tics or the pattems they form negatively charged? Again, it may certainly\nseem that way, but from the market’ perspective the information is neutral. Each up-tc, down-tie, or\npattern is just information, telling us the market's position. If any of this information had a negative\n‘charge as an inherent characteristic of the way it exists, then wouldn't everyone exposed to it\n‘experience emotional pain? For example, if both you and I get hit on the head with a solid object, there\nprobably wouldnt be much difference in how we would feel, We'd both be in pain. Any part of our\nbodies coming into contaet with a solid object with some degree of free will cause anyone with a\nnormal nervous system to experience pain\n\nWe share the experience because our bodies are constructed in basically the same way. The pain is an\ntaulomatie physiological response tothe impact with a tangible object. Information in the form of words\n‘or gestures expressed by the environment, or up and down ties expressed by the market, can be just as\npainful as being hit with a solid object; but there's an important difference between information and\n‘objecs, Information is not tangible. Information doesnt consist of atoms and molecules. To experience\nthe potential effects of information, whether negative or positive, requires an interpretation. The\ninterpretations we make are functions of our unique mental frameworks. Everyone's mental framework\nis unique for two fundamental reasons.\n\nFin, all of us were bom with different genetically encoded behavior and personality characteristics\nthat cause us to have different needs from one another. How positively oF negatively and to what\ndegree the environment responds to these needs creates experiences unique to each individual. Second,\n‘everyone is exposed to a variety of environmental forces. Some of these forces are similar from one\nindividual to the next, but none are exactly the same. If you consider the number of possible\n‘combinations of genetically encoded personality characteristies we ean be born with, in relation to the\nalmost infinite variety of environmental forces we can encounter throughout our lives, all of which\ncontribute to the construction of our mental framework, then it's not difficult to see why there is no\nuniversal mental framework common to everyone,\n\nUnlike our bodies, which have a common molecular structure that experiences physical pain, there is\nrho universal mind-set to assure us that we will share the potential negative oF positive effects of\ninformation in the same way. For example, someone could be projecting insults at you, intending 10\n‘eause you to feel emotional pain. From the environments perspective, this is negatively charged\ninformation, Wil you experience the intended negative effects? Not necessarily! You have to be able to\ninterpret the information as negative o experience it as negative. What if this person is insulting you in",

IF asked, each person would describe what he or she experienced from\ntheir perspective, as if it were the only true and valid version of the reality of the situation, The\n‘contradiction between these three versions of the truh suggests to me a larger philosophical issue that\nneeds tobe resolved. If beliefs limit our awareness of the information being generated by the physical\n‘environment, so that what we perceive is consistent with whatever we believe, then how do we know\nwhat the ruth is? To answer this question, we have to consider four ideas\n1. The environment can express itself in an infinite combination of ways. When you combine all the\nforces of nature interacting with everything created by humans, then add to thatthe forces generated by\nall the possible ways people can express themselves, the resull is a number of possible versions of\nreality that would surely overwhelm even the most onen-minded nerson\n2. Until we have acquired the ability to perceive eveiy possible way in which the environment can\n‘express itself, our beliefs will always represent a limited version of what is possible from the\n‘environment’s perspective, making our beliefs a statement about reality, but not necessarily a definitive\nstatement of reality\n3.

The difference between them is in the amount of\nenergy they contain. The fist has virtually no energy: the second has energy. So from a functional\nperspective, there is no contradiction or conflict. I propose that, i is possible to render one belief\ninactive, then i's possible to de-activate any belief, despite the Fact that all beliefs seem to resist any\nforce that would alter their present form. The secret to effectively changing our beliefs is in\nunderstanding and, consequently, believing that we really aren't changing our belief; we are simply\ntcunsferring energy from one concept to another concept, one that we find more useful in helping us\nto fulfill our desires of achieve our goals.\n\n2. All active beliefs demand expression. Beliefs fll into two basic categories: ative and inactive. The\nistintion between the two is simple. Active beliefs are energized; they have enough energy to act\nas a force on our perception of information and on our behavior. An inactive belief is just the\n‘opposite. Its a belief, that for any number of reasons, no longer has energy, or has so litle energy\nthat i's no longer able to act as a force on how we perceive information or how we express\n‘ourselves. When I say that all active beliefs demand expression, I don't mean to imply that every\nbelief in our mental environment is demanding to express itself simultaneously. For example, if 1\nask you to think about what's wrong with the world today, the word \"wrong\" would bring to your\nmind ideas about the nature ofthe world that reflect what you believe to be troubling or disturbing.\nUnless, of course, there is nothing about the state of the world you find troubling. The point is, if\nthere is something you do believe is wrong, you weren't necessarily thinking about those ideas\nbefore asked the question; but the moment I did, your beliefs about these issues instantly moved to\nthe forefront of your conscious thinking process. In effect, they demanded to be heard. I say that\nbeliefs “demand” to be expressed because once something causes us to tap into our beliefs, it seems\na if we cant stop the flood of energy that’s released. This is especially true of emotionally sensitive\nissues or beliefS we feel particularly passionate about. You might ask, \"Why would I want to hold\nback expressing my beliefs” There could be several reasons, Consider a scenario in which you'e\nthis person is saying something that you completely disagree with, or even find utterly absurd, Will\nYou express your tuth or hold back? That will depend on the beliefs you have about what is proper\nin such a situation. If your beliefs dictate that speaking up would be inappropriate, and those beets\nhhave more energy than the ones that are being contradited, then you'll probably hold back and not\nargue openly.\n\nYou might be looking at this person (the boss) and nodding your head in agreement. But is your\nmind in agreement? More to the point, is your mind silent? Absolutely not! Your position on the\nissues being presented are effectively countering each point the boss is making. In other words, your\nbeliefs are still demanding expression, but they aren't being expressed externally (in the\nenvironment) because other beliefs are acting as a counteracting; force. However OO * they will\nsoon find a way to get out, won't they? As Soon as you are out ofthe situation, you will probably",

Remember that the\nunderlying cause of fear is the potential to define and interpret market information as threatening.\n‘What isthe source of our potential to interpret market information as threatening?

For example, what if this child has a highly developed belie in\nbetrayal (he believes he's been betrayed by some very significant people in some very significant\nsituations that have caused him to experience intense emotional pain) IThe associates the attack by\nthis one dog as a \"betrayal\" by dogs in general (in essence a betrayal of his belief in dogs), then he\n‘could easily find himself afraid ofall dogs.\nAl of the positive energy contained in his original belief could instantly be transformed into\nnegatively charged energy.

But when you think about it, much of what we learn throughout our lives is\nstored at an unconscious oF subconscious level. If asked you to remember each specific skill you\nhhad fo lear so that you could drive a ear with confidence, chances are you woulda't remember all\nthe things you needed to concentrate and focus on while you were in the process of learning. The\nfist time I had the opportunity to teach a teenager how to drive, I was absolutely amazed at how\nmuch there was to lear, how much of the process [took for granted and no longer thought about at\n‘4 conscious level. Possibly the best example that illustrates this characteristic is people who drive\nunder the influence of alcohol. On any given day or night, there are probably thousands of people\nwho have had so much to drink that they have no idea that they have no conscious awareness of how\nthey drove from point A to point B. It is dificult to imagine how this is possible, unless you\n‘consider that driving skills and one's belief in his ability to drive operate automatically on a much\ndeeper level than waking consciousness. Certainly, some percentage of these drunk drivers get into\naccidents, but when you compare the accident rate with the estimated number of people driving\nunder the influence of alcohol, i's remarkable that there aren'ta great many more accidents. In fat,\n‘a drunk driver is probably most likely o cause an accident when he either falls asleep or something\nrequires a conscious decision and a fast reaction. In other words, the driving conditions are such that\n‘operating out of one's subconscious skill is not enough.\nSELF EVALUATION AND TRADING.\nHow this characteristic applies to our trading is also quite profound. The trading environment offers us\nan arena of unlimited opportunities to accumulate wealth. But just because the money is available and\n\\we can perceive the possibilty of getting it, dhat doesnt necessarily mean that we (as individuals) have\ntn unlimited sense of selfvaluation. In other words, there could be a huge gap between how much\nmoney we desire for ourselves, how much we perceive is available, and how much we actually believe\nWe are worth or deserve. Everyone has a sense of self-valuation. The easiest way to describe this sense\nis to list every active belief, both conscious and subconscious, that has the potential to argue either for\n‘or against accumulating or achieving greater and greater levels of success and prosperity. Then match\nthe energy from the positively charged beliefs against the energy from the negatively charged beliefs. IF\nyou have more positively charged energy arguing for success and prosperity than negatively charged\n‘energy arguing against them, then you have positive sense of self-valuation. Otherwise, you have a\nnegative sense of self-valuation, The dynamics of how these beliefs interact with one another is not\nnearly so simple as Tim making it sound. In fact, it can be so complex that it could take years of\nsophisticated mental work to organize and sort out. What you need to know is that it almost\nimpossible to grow up in any social environment and not acquire some negatively charged beliefs that\nould argue against success or accumulating vast sums of money.",

How do we acquire\nself-sabotaging beliefs? Unfortunately, its extremely easy. Probably the most common way is when a\nchild engages in some activity that a parent or teacher doesn't want him to do and the child accidently\ninjures himself. Many parents, to ge thei point across tothe child, will respond toa situation like this\nby saying, \"This (whatever pain you are experiencing) wouldn't have happened to you if you didn't\ndeserve it” or \"You disobeyed me and look what happened, God punished you.\" The problem with\n‘making or hearing statements like this is tha there's a potential for the child to associate every future\ninjury with these same statements and, subsequently, form a belief that he must be an unworthy person,\nundeserving of suecess, happiness, or love. Anything we fel guilty about can have an adverse effect on\n‘our sense of sel-worth.\n\nUsually guilt is associated with being a bad person, and most people believe that bad people should be\npunished, certainly not rewarded. Some religions teach children that having a lot of money isn't godly\n‘or spiritual. Some people believe that making money in certain ways is wrong, even though it may be\nperfectly legal and moral from society's perspective. Again, you may not have a speoifir recollection of\nlearning something that would argue against the success you perceive as possible, but that doesnt mean\nthat what you learned is no longer having an effect. The way these subconscious self-sabotaging beliefs\n‘manifest themselves in our trading is usually inthe form of lapses in focus or concentration, resulting\nin any number of trading errors, like putting in a buy for a sell or vice versa, or allowing yourself 10\ngive in to distracting thoughts that compel you to leave the sereen, only to find out when you return that\nyou missed the big trade of the day.\n\nTye worked with many traders who achieved various levels of consistent success, but found they just\n‘couldn't break through certain thresholds in acquiring equity.

I am not implying here that you have to de-aetivate every belief that would argue against\nyour ever-expanding positive sense of selfvaluation, because you don't.

What separates the \"consistently great” athletes and performers from everyone else is\ntheir distinct lack of fear of making a mistake. The reason they aren't afraid is that they don't have a\nreason to think less of themselves when they do make a mistake, meaning they don't have a reservoir of\nnegatively charged energy waiting to well up and pounce on their conscious thought process like a lion\nWaiting for the right moment 1o pounce on its intended prey. What accounts for this uncommon\n‘capacity o quickly move beyond their errors without criticizing themselves?\n\nOne explanation may be that they grew up with extremely unusual parents, eachers, and coaches, who\nby their words and examples taught them to correct their miscaleulations and errors with genuine love,\naffection, and acceptance. I say “extremely unusual” because many of us grew up with just the opposite\n‘experience. We were taught to correct our mistakes or miscalculations with anger, impatience, and a\ndistinct lack of acceptance. Is it possible that, forthe great athletes, their past positive experiences with\nrespeet to mistakes caused them to acquire belief that mistakes simply point the way to where they\nneed to focus ther efforts to grow and improve themselves? With a belief like that, there's no source of\nnegatively charged energy and consequently no source for self-denigrating thoughts.\n\nHowever, the rest of us, who did grow up experiencing a plethora of negative reactions to our ations,\n‘Would naturally acquire beliefs about mistakes: \"Mistakes must be avoided at all costs,” \"There must be\nsomething wrong with me if T make a mistake,\" \"T must be a screw-up,” or \"I must be a bad person if\nmake a mistake.\" Remember that every thought, word, and deed reinforces some belief we have about\n‘ourselves. If by repeated negative self-criticism, we acquire a belief that we'e \"serew-ups, that belief\nwill find a way to express itself in our thoughts, causing us to become distracted and to serew up; on\n‘our words, causing us to say things about ourselves or about others (if we notice the same\n‘characteristics in them) that reflect our belief; and on our actions, causing us to behave in ways that are\noverly self-sabolaging.

You can work on acquiring a new set of positively charged beliefs about what it means to make &\nmistake, along with de-activating any negatively charged beliefs that would argue otherwise or cause\nYou to think less of yourself for making a mistake.\n\n2, Ifyou find this first choice undesirable, you can compensate for the potential to make errors by the\n\\way you set up your trading regime",

However, coming out of college, my life was unfolding in the\nway that was very different from what I had expected. It was not to my liking, but atthe time I felt\npowerless to do anything about it, This led toa period of inactivity, which is a nice way of saying that I\nwas severely depressed. Again, Im not sure what prompted me to suddenly want to become a runner\n(maybe I saw some TV program that sparked my interes)\n1 do, however, remember that the motivation was verv strong. So, I went out and bought myself some\nrunning shoes, put them on, and went out to run, The first thing I discovered was that I couldnt do it. 1\ndidn’t have the physical stamina to run more than fifty or sixty yards. This was very surprising. I did't\nrealize, nor would I have ever believed, that I was so out of shape that I couldn't run even a hundred\nyards.

I really didnt know: it was to0 vague and abstract. [had 10\nhave something more tangible to work towards\n\nSo I decided that I wanted to be able to run five miles by the end of the summer. Five miles seemed\ninsurmountable atthe time, but thinking that I might be able to doit generated a lot of enthusiasm. This\nincreased level of enthusiasm gave me enough impetus to run four times that week.

Now I thought I was well on my way to the five miles, unl I iterally ran into my next set of\nproblems.\n\n‘The biggest were the conflicting and distracting thoughts that flooded my consciousness every time I\ndecided I wanted to go out and run.

However, more times than not, my conflicting and distracting\nthoughts caused me to stay put, In fact, inthe beginning stages, I estimate that two-thirds ofthe time I\nwas unable to get past the conflicting energy.\n\n‘The next problem I encountered was that when I started approaching the point where I was able to run\n‘one mile, 1 was so thrilled with myself that it aceurred to me I was going to need an additional\nmechanism to get me to the five miles. I reasoned that once I got tothe point where I could run two oF\n‘maybe three miles, I would be so overwhelmingly pleased with myself that I wouldn't feel any need 10\nfulfil my five-mile objective. So I made a rule for myself. You could call it the five-mile rule. \"ICT\nmanaged to get my running shoes on and get outside in spite ofall the conflicting thoughts trying to\ntalk me out of i, I committed myself to running at least one step farther than the last time Tran.” It was\n‘certainly all right if Tran more than one step further, but it couldnt be less than one step, no matter\nwhat, As it tums out, I never broke this rule, and by the end of the summer, I made it to five miles.",

Each time I experienced a\n‘conflicting thought and was able to successfully refocus on my objective, with enough conviction to get\n‘me into my running shoes and out the door, I added energy tothe belief that \"Lam a runner.” And, just\n1s important, inadvertently drew energy avvay from all ofthe beliefs that would argue otherwise. I suy\ninadvertently because there are various techniques specifically designed to identify and de-aetivate\nconflicting beliefs, but at that time in my life, I didn't understand the underlying dynamics of the\nprocess of transformation I was going through.

It doesn't matter what its, a8 long as i's\nliquid and you can afford the margin requirements for trading atleast three hundred shares or three\nfatures contracts per trade,\n\nChoose a set of market variables that define an edge. This can be any trading system you want. The\ntrading system or methodology you choose can be mathematical, mechanical, or visual (based on\npatterns in price charts). It doesn't matter whether you personally design the system or purchase it from\nsomeone else, nor do you need to take a long time oF be too picky trying t Find or develop the best oF\nright system. This exercise is not about system development and itis not a test of your analytical\nabilities. Infact, the variables you ehoose can even be considered mediocre by most traders’ standards,\n\nbecause what you are going to learn from doing this exercise is not dependent upon whether you\nactually make money.\n\nI you consider this exercise an educational expense, it will eut down on the amount of time and effort\nyou might otherwise expend trying to find the most profitable edges. For those of you who might be\nWondering, Im not going to make any specific recommendations about what system or variables you\nshould use, because I assume that most of the people reading this book are already well schooled in\ntechnical analysis. If you need additional assistance, there are hundreds of books available on the topic,\n\n1s well as system vendors who are more than willing to sell you their ideas. However, if you've made a\ngenuine attempt to do this on your own but are still having problems picking a system, you can contact\nime at markdouglas.com or tradinginthezone.com and 1 will make some recommendations. Whatever\nsystem you choose to use has to fit within the following specifications.\n\nTrade Entry. The variables you use to define your edge have to be absolutely precise.

For example, if you use variables that identify\n«8 particular support and resistance pattern on a 30-minute bar chart, then your risk and profit objective\n‘calculations also have tobe determined in 8 30-minute time frame. However, trading in one time frame\n‘does not preclude you from using other time frames as filters. For example, you could have asa filler &\nrule that states you're only going to take trades that are in the direction of the major trend. There's an\n‘old trading axiom that \"The trend is your friend.” It means that you have a higher probability of success\n\\when you trade inthe direction of the major tend, i[there is one. In fact, the lowestrsk trade, with the\nhighest probability of suecess, occurs when you are buying dips (support) in an up-trending market or\nselling rallies (resistance) in a down-trending market. To illustrate how this rule works, le’s say that\nyou've chosen a precise way of identifying support and resistance patterns in a 30- minute time frame\nas your edge. The rule is that you are only going to take trades in the direction of the major tend. A.\ntrending market is defined as a series of higher highs and higher lows for an up-trending market and a\nseries of lower highs and lower lows for a downtrending market. The longer the time frame, the more\nsignificant the trend, so a trending market on a daily bar chart is more significant than a trending\n‘market on a 30-minute bar chat. Therefore, the trend on the daly bar chart would take precedence over\nthe wend on the 30-minute bar chart and would be considered the major rend\n\nTo determine the direction of the major rend, look at what is happening on a daily bar chart. I the\ntrend is up on the daily, you are only going to look fora sell-off or retracement down to what your edge\ndefines as support on the 30-minute chart. That's where you will become a buyer. On the other hand, if\nthe trend is down on the daily, you are only going to look for a rally up to what your edge defines as a\nresistance level to be a seller on the 30-minute chart. Your objective is to determine, in a down\nleending market, how fur it can rally on an intraday basis and stil not violate the symmetry of the\nlonger rend. In an up-trending market, your objective is to determine how far it can sell off on an\nintraday basis without violating the symmetry of the longer tend. There's usually very little risk\nassociated with these intraday support and resistance points, because you don't have to let the market\n0 very fur beyond them to tell you the trade isn't working.\n\nTaking Profits. Believe it or not, of all the skills one needs to learn to be a consistently successful\ntrader, learning to take profits i probably the most difficult to master. A multitude of personal, often\nvery complicated psychological factors, as well as the effectiveness of one's market analysis, enter into\nthe equation, Unfortunately, sorting out this complex matsix of issues goes way beyond the scope of\nthis book. I point this out so that those of you who might be inclined to beat yourselves up for leaving\nmoney on the table can relax and give yourselves a break. Even afler you've acquired all the other\nskills, it might take a very long time before you get this one down pat. Don't despair. There is a way to",

Because the object of the belief is winning\n‘consistently, how you take profits in a winning trade is of paramount importance. This is the only part\n‘of the exercise in which you will have some degree of discretion about what you do. The underlying\npremise is that, in a winning trade, you never know how far the market is going to go in your direction\nMarkets rarely go stright up or straight down, (Many of the NASDAQ Internet stocks in the fall of\n1999 were an obvious exception to this statement.) Typically, markets go up and then retrace some\nportion of the upward move: or go down and then retrace some portion of the downward move. These\nproportional reiracee\"nts ean make it very dificult to stay in a winning trade. You would have to be an\n‘extremely sophisticated and objective analyst o make the distinction between a normal retracement,\nwhen the market still has the potential to move inthe original direction of your trade, and a etracement\nthat isnt normal, when the potential for any further movement in the original direction of your trade is\nreally diminished, if not nonexistent\n\nIf you never know how far the market is going to go in your direction, then when and how do you take\nprofits? The question of when isa function of your ability to ead the market and pick the most likely\nspots for it to stop. In the absence of an ability to do this objectively, the best course of action from a\npsychological perspective is to divide your postion into thirds (or quarters), and scale out the position\nas the market moves in your favor. If you are trading futures contracts this means your minimum\nposition for a trade is atleast three (or four) contracts. For stocks, the minimum position is any number\n‘of shares that is divisible by three (or four), so you dont end up with an odd-lot order. Here's the way 1\nscale out ofa winning position. When I first started trading, especially during the first three years (1979\nUrough 1981), I would thoroughly and regularly analyze the results of my trading activites. One of the\nthings I discovered was that Iarely got stopped out of a trade for a loss, without the market frst going\nat Ieast a litle way in my direction. On average, only one out of every ten trades was an immediate\nloser that never went in my direction. Out of the other 25 to 30 percent of the trades that were\nUltimately losers, the market usually went in my direction by three or four ties before revising and\nstopping me out, I calculated that i got into the habit of taking a least a third of my original position\n‘off every time the market gave me those three or four ties, at the end of the year the accumulated\nWinnings would go a long way towards paying my expenses. I was right. To this day, I always, without\nreservation or hesitation, take off a portion of a Winning position whenever the market gives me a Tile\nto take.\n\nHow much that might be depends on the market; it will be a different amount in each case. For\n‘example, in Treasury bond futures, I take a third of my postion off when I get four tes. In the S&P\nfutures, [take a third off fora profit of one and a half to two full points. Ina bond trade, 1 usually don\nFisk more than six ties to find out if the trade is going to work, Using a three-contraet trade as an",

More likely, the trade goes in my favor by some small amount\nbefore becoming a loser. If it goes in my favor by at least four ties, I take those four ties on one\n‘contract. What I have done is reduce my total risk on the other two contracts by 10 ties. Ifthe market\nthen stops me out ofthe last two contracts, the net loss on the trade is only 8 tes. IF don't get stopped\n‘out on the last wo contracts and the market moves in my direction, I take the next third of the position\noff at some predetermined profit objective\n\n‘This is based on some longer time frame support or resistance, or on the test of a previous significant\nhigh or low. When I take profits on the second third, I also move the stop-loss to my original entry\npoint, Now I have a net profit on the trade regardless of what happens to the last third of the position,\nIn other words, I now have a \"risk-free opportunity.” I can't emphasize enough nor can the publisher\nrake the words on this page big enough fo stress how important itis for you to experience the state of\n“risk-free opportunity.” When you set up a situation in which there is “risk-free opportunity.” there's no\n\\way to lose unless something extremely unusual happens, like a limit up or limit down move through\n{your stop. If, under normal circumstances, there's no way to lose, you get to experience what it really\nfeels like to be in a trade with a relaxed, carefree state of mind, To illustrate this point, imagine that you\nae ina winning trade; the market made a fatty significant move in your direction, but you didn't take\nany profits because you thought it was going even further.\n\nHowever, instead of going further, the market trades all the way back to oF very close to your original\n‘entry point. You panie and, as a result, liquidate the trade, because you don't want to let what was once\n1 Winning trade turn into a loser. But as soon as you're out, the market bounces right back into what\n‘would have been a winning trade. Ifyou had locked in Some profits by scaling out, putting yourself in a\nrisklree opportunity situation, it s very unlikely that you would have panicked or felt any stress or\nanxiety for that matter.

I place my\n‘order to liquidate just below that spot in a long position or just above that spot in a short position. 1\nplace my orders just above or just below because I don't care about squeezing the last tie out of the\ntrade. Ihave found over the years that trying to do that just isnt worth it. One other factor you need to\nlake into consideration is your rsk-to-reward ratio. The risk-o-reward ratio isthe dollar value of how\n‘much risk you have to take relative to the profit potential. Ideally, your risk-o-reward rato should be at\nleast 3:1, which means you are only risking one dollar for every three dollars of profit potential. If your\n‘edge and the way you scale out of your trades give you a 3:1 risk-to-reward ratio, your winning trade\npercentage can be less than S0 percent and you wil still make money consistently. A 3:1 risk-to-reward\nratio is ideal. However, forthe purposes of ths exercise, it doesnt matter what iti, nor does it matter\nhow effectively you scale out, as long as you do it.

As you now know, knowing the risk and accepting the\nrisk are two different things. I want you to be as comfortable as possible with the dollar value of the\nrisk you are taking in this exercise, Becuse the exercise requires that you use a 20-trade sample size, the\npotential risk is that you will lose on all 20 trades. This is obviously the worst-case scenario Its as\nlikely an occurrence as that you willwin on all 20 trades, which means it isnt very likely. Nevertheless,\nitis a possiblity. Therefore, you should set up the exercise in such a way that you ean accept the risk\n(in dollar value) of losing om all 20 trades.\n\nFor example, if you're trading S&P futures, your edge might require that you risk thre full points per\n‘contract to find out ifthe trade is going to work. Since the exercise requites that you trade & minimum\n‘of three contracts per trade, the total dollar value of the risk per trade is $2.250, if you use big contracts\n‘The accumulated dollar value of risk if you lose on all 20 trades is $45,000, You may not be\n‘comfortable risking $45,000 on this exercise\n\nIf you're not comfortable, you can reduce the dollar value of the risk by trading S&P mini contracts (E-\nMini). They are one-fifth the value ofthe big contracts, so the total dollar value of the visk per trade\ngoes down to $450 and the accumulated risk forall 20 trades is $9,000. You ean do the same thing if\nyou are trading stocks: Just keep on reducing the number of shares per trade until you get to a point\nWhere you are comfortable with the total accumulated risk forall 20 trades. What I don't want you to\n‘dois change your established risk parameters to satisfy your comfort levels,\n\nIf, based on your research, you have determined that a three-point risk in the S&Ps is the optimum\ndistance you must let the market trade against your edge to tell you i isnt worth staying inthe position,\nthen leave it at three points. Change this variable only if it is warranted from a technical analysis\nperspective. If you've done everything possible to reduce your postion size and find that you sil aren't\n‘comfortable with the accumulated dollar value of losing on all 20 trades, then I suggest you do the\n‘exercise with a simulated brokerage service. With a simulated brokerage service, everything about the\nprocess of putting on and taking off trades, including fills and brokerage statements, is exactly the same\n1s with an actual brokerage firm, except that the trades are not actully entered into the market. AS a\nresult, you don't actually have any money at risk, A simulated brokerage service is an excellent to to\npractice with in real time, under real market conditions: its also an excellent tool for forward testing a\ntrading system. There may be others, but the only service of this nature that I know of is\nAuditrack.com.\n\nDoing the Exercise. When you have a set of variables that conforms to the specifications described,\nyou know exaetly what each trade is going to cost to Find out if i's going to work, you have a plan for\ntaking profits, and you know what you can expect as a win-loss ratio for your sample size, then you are",

The rules are simple: Trade your system exactly as you have designed i\n‘This means you have to commit yourself to trading atleast the next 20 occurrences of your edge—not\njust the next trade or the next couple of trades, but all 20, no matter what, You cannot deviate, use or be\ninfluenced by any other extraneous factors, or change the variables that define your edge until you have\n‘completed a full sample size. By setting up the exercise with rigid variables that define your edge,\nrelatively fixed odds, and a commitment to take every trade in your sample size, you have created a\ntrading regime that duplicates how a casino operates.\n\nWhy do casinos make consistent money on an event that has random outcome? Because they know\nthat over a series of events, the ods are in their favor. They also know that to realize the benefits of the\nfavorable odds, they have to participate in every event. They cant engage in a process of picking and\n‘choosing which hand of blackjack, spin of the roulette wheel, or roll of the dice they are going to\nparticipate in, by trying to predict in advance the outcome of each of these individual events. If you\nbelieve in the five fundamental truths and you believe that trading is jut a probability game, not much\ndifferent from pulling the handle of a slot machine, then youll find that this exercise will be\neffortless —elfortless because your desire to follow through with your commitment to take every trade\nin your sump size and your belie in the probabilistic nature of trading will be in complete harmony,\n‘Asa result, there will be no fear, resistance, or distracting thoughts. What could stop you from doing\n‘exactly what you need to do, when you need to doit, without reservation or hesitation? Nothing!\n\nOn the other hand, if it hasn't already occurred to you, this exercise is going to create a head-on\ncollision between your desire to think objectively in probabilities and all the forces inside you that are\nin conflict with this desire. The amount of difficulty you have in doing this exercise will be in direct\nproportion to the degree to which these conflicts exist. To one degree or another, you will experience\nthe exaet opposite of what I described in the previous paragraph, Don't be surprised if you find your\nfirst couple of attempts at doing this exercise virally impossible. How should you handle these\n‘conflicts? Monitor yourself and use the technique of self-discipline to refocus on your objective. Write\n‘down the five fundamental truths and the seven principles of consistency, and keep them in front of you\nall times when you ate trading.\n\nRepeat them to yourself frequently, with conviction. Every time you notice that you are thinking\nsaying, or doing something that is inconsistent with these truths or principles, acknowledge the conflict.\nDon't try to deny the existence of conflicting forces. They are simply parts of your psyche that are\n(understandably) arguing for their versions of the tuth. When this happens, refocus on exactly what\nyou are tying to accomplish. If your purpose is to think objectively, disrupt the association process (so\nyou ean stay in the \"now moment opportunity flow\"); step through your fears of being wrong, losing\n‘money, missing out, and leaving money on the table (so you can stop making errors and start trusting\nyoursel) then youll know exactly what you need to do. Follow the rules of your trading regime as best\nyou can. Doing exactly what your rules call for while focused on the five fundamental truths will\n‘eventually resolve all your conflicts about the true nature of trading. Every time you actually do",

      "formula": "FOREWORD\n‘The great bull market in stocks has led to an equally great bull market in the number of books\npublished on the subject of how to make money trading the markets. Many ideas abound, some good,\nsome not, Some original, some just a repackaging of earlier works. Occasionally, though, a writer\n‘comes forward with something that really sets him or her apart from the pack, something special. One\nsuch writer is Mark Douglas. Mark Douglas, in Trading in the Zone, has written a book that is the\naccumulation of years of thought and research—the work of a lifetime —and for those of us who view\ntrading as a profession, he has produced a gem.\nTrading in the Zone is an in-depth look at the challenges that we face when we take up the challenge of\ntrading. To the novice, the only challenge appears to be to find a way to make money. Once the novice\nTeams that tips, brokers advice, and other ways to justify buying or selling do not work consistently, he\ndiscovers that he either needs to develop a reliable trading strategy or purchase one. After that, trading\nshould be easy, right? All you have to do is follow the rules, and the money will all nto your lp.\nAL this point, if not before, novices discover that trading can turn into one of the most frustrating\nexperiences they will ever face\n‘This experience leads tothe oft-started statistic that 95 percent of futures trades lose all oftheir money\nWithin the frst year of trading. Stock traders generally experience the same results, which is why\npundits always point to the fact that most stock traders fail to outperform a simple buy and hold\ninvestment scenario,\nSo, why do people, the majority of whom are extremely successful in other occupations, fail so\nmiserably as traders? Are successful traders born and not made? Mark Douglas says no. What's\nnecessary, he says, is thatthe individual acquire the trader's mindset. It sounds easy, but the fact is, this\nmindset is very foreign when compared with the way our life experiences teach us to think about the\nworld\n‘That 95-percent failure rate makes sense when you consider how most of us experience life, using\nskills learned as we grow. When it comes to trading, however, it tums out that the skills we learn to\narm high marks in school, advance our careers, and ereate relationships with other peopl, the skills we\nare taught that should carry us through life, tum out to be inappropriate for wading. Traders, we find\n‘out, must learn to think in terms of probabilities and to surrender all ofthe skills we have acquired to\nachieve in virally every other aspect of our lives. In Trading in the Zone, Mark Douglas teaches us\nhow. He has put together a very valuable book. His sources are his own personal experiences as a\nleader, a traders coach in Chicago, author, and lecturer in his field of trading psychology\nMy recommendation? First see how o trading community looks like and then Enjoy Douglas's Trading\nin the Zone and, in doing so, develop a trader's mindset",

When I stated trading in 1978, technical analysis was used by only a handful of\ntraders, who were considered by the rest ofthe market community tobe, atthe very least, crazy. As\nAifcult as is o believe now, it wasnt very long ago when Wall Street and most ofthe major funds\nand financial ins tions thought hat echnical analysis was some form of mystical hocus-pocus\nNow, of course, just the opposite is tre.

The problem with making trading decisions fiom a sticly fundamental perspective is the\ninherent difficulty of making money consistently using this approach\nFor those of you who may aot be familiar with fundamental analysis, let me explain. Fundamental\nanalysis temps to take into consideration all the variables that could affect the relative balance ot\nimbalance between the supply of and the possible demand for any particular stock, commodity, of\nfactors (tres rates, balance shees, weaher patterns, and numerous other) the analyst projects what\nthe price should beat some point in the future.\n‘The problem with these models is tht they rarely if eve, factor in other traders as variables.

But in the meantime, price movement could be so volatile that it would be\nvery difficult, ifnot impossible, to stay in a trade in order to realize the objective.\n\n‘THE SHIFT TO TECHNICAL ANALYSIS\n‘Technical analysis has been around for as long as there have been organized markets in the form of\n‘exchanges. But the trading community didnt accept technical analysis as a viable tool for making\n‘money until the late 1970s oF early 1980s. Here's what the technical analyst knew that it took the\n‘mainstream market community generations to catch on to\nA finite number of traders participate in the markets on any given day. week, or month, Many of these\ntraders do the same lands of things over and over in their attempt to make money. In other words,\nindividuals develop behavior pattems, and a group of individuals, interacting with one another on &\n‘consistent basis, form collective behavior patterns. These behavior pattems are observable and\n‘quantifiable, and they repeat themselves with statistical reliability. Technical analysis is a method that\n‘organizes this collective behavior into identifiable patterns that can give a elear indication of when\nthere isa greater probability of one thing happening over another. In a sense, technical analysis allows\nYou to get into the mind of the market to anticipate what's likely to happen next, based on the kind of\npatterns the market generated at some previous moment,\n‘As a method for projecting future price movement, echnical analysis has tured out to be far superior\n1o a purely fundamental approach. It keeps the trader focused on what the market is doing nov in\nrelation to what it has done in the pas, instead of focusing on what the market should be doing based\nsolely on what is logical and reasonable as determined by a mathematical model. On the other hand\nfundamental analysis ereates what I call a \"reality gap\" between \"what should be\" and \"what is.” The\nreality gap makes it extremely difficult to make anything but very long-term predictions that ean be\ndifficult wo exploit, even if they are correct.\nIn contrast, technical analysis not only closes this reality gap, but also makes available to the trader a\nVirtually unlimited number of possibilities to take advantage of. The technieal approach opens up many\nmore possibilities because it identifies how the same repeatable behavior patterns occur in every time\nframe—moment-tomoment, daily, weekly, yearly, and every time span in between. In other words,\ntechnical analysis tums the masket into an endless stream of opportunities to enrich oneself.\n\n‘THE SHIFT TO MENTAL ANALYSIS\n\nI technical analysis works so well, why would more and more of the trading community shift dheie\nfocus from technical analysis of the market to mental analysis of themselves, meaning their own\nindividual trading psychology? To answer this question, you probably don't have to do anything more",

I\n‘allthis difference, and others like it, a “psychological gap” that can make trading one of the most\nUifficult endeavors you could choose to undertake and certainly one of the most mysterious to master.\n‘The big question is: Can trading be mastered?

While the markets can be described as an arena of endless opportunites,\nthey simultaneously confront the individual with some of the most sustained, adverse psychological\n‘conditions you can expose yourself to, At some point, everyone who trades learns something about the\n‘markets that will indicate when opportunities exist, But learning how to identify an opportunity to buy\n‘or sell does not mean that you have learned to think like a trader.\n\n‘The defining characteristic that separates the consistent winners from everyone else is this: The winners\nhave attained a mind-set—aunique set of attitudes—that allows them to remain disciplined, focused,\nand, above all, confident in spite of the adverse conditions. As a result, they are no longer susceptible to\nthe common fears and trading errors that plague everyone else. Everyone who trades ends up learning\nsomething about the markets; very few people who trade ever learn the attitudes that are absolutely\n‘essential to becoming a consistent winner, Just as people can learn to perfect the proper technique for\nswinging a golf club or tennis racket, their consistency, or lack of it, will without a doubt come from\ntheir attiude Traders who make it beyond \"the threshold of consistency” usually experience a great\n‘deal of pain (both emotional and financial) before they acquire the land of altitude that allows them to\nfunction effectively in the market environment. The rare exceptions are usually those who were born\ninto suecessful trading families or who started their trading careers under the guidance of someone who\nunderstood the true nature of trading, and, just 2s important, knew how to teach it\n\nWhy are emotional pain and financial disaster common among traders? The simple answer is that most\n‘of us weren't fortunate enough to start our trading careers with the proper guidance.\n\nHowever, the reasons go much deeper than this. I have spent the last seventeen years dissecting the\npsychological dynamics behind trading so that 1 could develop effective methods for teaching the\nprinciples of success. What Ive discovered is that trading is chock full of paradoxes and contradictions\nin thinking that make it extremely difficult to learn how to be successful. In fact, if Thad to choose one\nword that encapsulates the nature of trading it would be \"paradox.\"\n\n(Acconting to the dictionary, a paradox is Something that seems to have contradictory qualities or that\nis contrary to common belief or what generally makes sense to people.)\n\nFinancial and emotional disaster are common among traders because many of the perspectives,\nattitudes, and principles that would otherwise make perfect sense and work quite well in our daily lives\nhave the opposite effect in the trading environment. They just don't work. Not knowing this, most\ntraders start their careers with a fundamental lack of understanding of what it means to be a trader, the\nstills that are involved, and the depth to which those skills need to be developed.\n\nHere isa prime example of what Iam talking about: Trading is inherently risky. To my knowledge, no\ntrade has a guaranteed outcome: therefore, the possibility of being wrong and losing money is always\npresent, So when you put on a trade, ean you consider yourself a rish-taker?

If I engage in an activity that is inherently\nrisky, then I must be a rsktaker. This isa perfectly reasonable assumption for any trader to make. In\nfact, not only do viewally all waders make this assumption, but most traders take pride in thinking of\nthemselves as rsk-takers. The problem is that this assumption couldnt be further from the tuth. OF\n‘course, any trader is taking a risk when you put on a trade, but that doesn't mean that you ane\nccomrespondingly accepting that risk. In other words, all trades are risky because the outcomes are\nprobable—not guaranteed. But do most traders really believe they ate taking a risk when they put on a\ntrade? Have they really accepted that the rade has a non-guaranteed, probable outcome? Furthermore,\nhave they fully accepted the possible consequences?\n\n‘The answer is, unequivocally, no! Most traders have absolutely no concept of what it means t0 be a\nrisk-taker in the way a successful trader thinks about risk. The best traders not only take the risk, they\nhave also leamed to accept and embrace that risk. There is a huge psychological gap between assuming\nyou are a risk-aker because you put on trades and Fully accepting the risks inherent in each trade\n\nWhen you fully accept the risks, it will have profound implications on your botiom-line performance.\n‘The best traders can put on a trade without the slightest bt of hesitation or conflict, and just as freely\nand without hesitation or conflict, admit it isnt working. They can get out of the trade—even with a\nloss—and doing so doesn't resonate the slightest bit of emotional discomfort. In other words, the risks\ninherent in trading do not cause the best traders to lose their discipline, focus, or sense of confidence.\n\nI you are unable to trade without the slightest bit of emotional discomfort (specifically, feat), then you\nhave not leamed how to accept the risks inherent in trading. This is a big problem, because to whatever\ndegree you haven't accepted the risk, is the same degree to which you will avoid the risk. Trying to\navoid something that is unavoidable will have disastrous effects on your ability to trade suecessfully\nLeaming to tuly accept the risks in any endeavor can be difficult, but itis extremely difficult for\ntraders, especially considering what's at stake. What are we generally most afraid of (besides dying or\npublic speaking)? Certainly, losing money and being wrong both rank close to the top of the list\nAdmitting we are wrong and losing money fo boot can be extremely painful, and certainly something 10\navoid. Yet as traders, we are confronted with these two possibilities virally every moment we are in a\ntrade. Now, you might be saying to yourself, \"Apart from the fact that it hurts so much, i's natural 10\nnot want to be wrong and lose something: therefore, its appropriate for me to do whatever I ean 10\navoid it\" I agree with you. But itis also this natural tendency that makes trading (which looks like it\nshould be easy) extremely difficult,\n\n‘Trading presents us with a fundamental paradox: How do we remain disciplined, focused, and\n‘confident in the face of constant uncertainty? When you have leared how to “think” like a trader, that's\n‘exactly what youll be able to do, Learning how to redefine your trading activites ina way that allows\nyou to completely accept the risk is the key to thinking like a successful trader.

Ths is called an objective perspective—one that is not skewed or distorted by what\nYou are afraid is going to happen or not happen.\n\nTm sure there isn't one trader reading this book who hasn't gotten into trades too soon—before the\n‘market has actually generated a signal, or too late—long after the market has generated a signal.

These are but a few ofthe many errors traders perpetuate\nupon themselves time and time again, These are not market-generated errors. That is, these errs do\nnot come from the market. The market is neutral, inthe sense that it moves and generates information\nabout itself, Movement and information provide each of us with the opportunity to do something, but\nthat’ all!

They aren't afraid because they have developed attitudes that\ngive them the greatest degree of mental flexibility to flow in and out of trades based on what the market\nis telling them about the possiblities from its perspective. AL the same time, the best traders have\n‘developed attitudes that prevent them from getting reckless, Everyone else is afraid, to some degree or\nanother.

If you're afraid of being wrong, your fear will act upon your perception\n‘of market information in a way that will cause you to do something that ends up making you wrong.\nWhen you are fearful, no other possibilities exist. You can't perceive other possiblities or at on them\nproperly, even if'you did manage fo perceive them, because fear is immobilizing. Physically, it causes\nus to freeze or run.

Once we recognize a\nneed or desire, we move to fill the vacuum with an experience in the exterior environment. If we are\ndenied the opportunity to pursue the object of this need or desire, it literally feels as if we are not\n\\whole, or that something is missing, which puts us into a state of imbalance or emotional pain. (Do our\nminds also abhor a vacuum, once one has been created?) Take a toy away from a child who is not\nfinished playing with it (regardless of how good your reasons may be for doing so) and the universal\nresponse will be emotional pain.",

To illustrate this point, let's\ngo back to our novice trader who started out witha carefree state of mind until he experienced his first,\nloss.

In other words, the underlying reason for why the novice trader is learning about the market is 10\n‘overcome the market, to prove something to it and himself, and most important, to prevent the market\nfrom busting him again, He is not learning the market simply as a means to give himself a systematic\n\\way of winning, but rather as a way to either avoid pain or prove something that has absolutely nothing\nto do with looking atthe market from an objective perspective.

IUs really not a question of what someone wants, because I\nbelieve that all raders want to win, Yet, there are oflen conflicts about winning. Sometimes these\n‘conflicts are so powerful that we find our behavior is in direct conflict with what we want. These\nconflicts could stem from religious upbringing, work ethic or certain types of childhood trauma.

He said this facetiously, but there is alot of truth fo his statement. Obviously,\nif you lose more money than you make, you can't survive.

Obviously, the market has nothing\ntodo with your potential for recklessness, nor does it have anything to do with the erors you make as a\nresult of some internal conflict about deserving the money.\n\nProbably one of the hardest concepts for traders to effectively assimilate is that the market doesn't\n‘reate your attitude or state of mind: it simply acts as a misror reflecting whats inside back to you. If\nyou are confident, i's not because the market is making you feel that way; itis because your belies and\ntliiudes are aligned in a way that allows you to step forward into an experience, take responsibility for\nthe outcome, and extract the insight that's been made available. You maintain your confident state of\nrind simply because you are constantly learning.

Doing\nthis effectively will require an understanding ofthe nature of mental energy and how you can use that\n‘energy to change a perspective that is generating an unwanted, negative, emotional response to market\ninformation. There's much to learn, but I dhink you will be amazed at how some simple changes can\nmake a huge difference in your trading resulls. The process of trading starts with perceiving an\n‘opportunity. Without the perception of an opportunity, we wouldn't have a reason to trade. So Think it\nis only Giting that we start our examination of mental energy by breaking down the process of\nperception,\nWhat are the underlying dynamics of perception? What factors determine how we perceive information\n‘or what we perceive in relationship to what is available? How is perception connected with what we\n‘experience at any given moment? Probably the easiest way to understand the dynamics of perception\nand answer these questions is to think of everything (and I do tion of forces—forves that generate\ninformation about the properties, characteristics, and traits that make them uniguely what they are.\nEverything that exists outside of our bodies—all plants and all categories of life: all planetary\nphenomena in the form of weather conditions, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions; all active and inert,\nphysical matter; and all noncorporeal phenomena such as light, sound waves, microwaves, and\nradiation—generates information about the nature o its existence. That information has the potential to\ntot as a force on one of our five physical senses. Before we go any further, notice that I use the verb\n™ generate” in an all-inclusive way implying that everything is in an active state of expression, including\ninanimate objects\nTo illustrate why I do that let's look at something as simple as a rock. Its an inanimate object,\n‘composed of unique atoms and molecules expressing themselves as a rock. I can use the active verb\n\"expressing\" because the atoms and molecules that make up the rock are in constant motion. So, even\nthough the rock doesn't appear active except in the most abstract sense, it has characteristics and\nproperties that will act as forces on our senses, causing us to experience and make distinctions about\nthe nature ofits existence. For example, a rock has texture, and that texture acts as a force on our sense\n‘of touch if we run our fingers across the rock's surface.\n‘A rock has shape and color, which act asa force on our vision; the rock takes up space that no other\n‘object can occupy, so that we see it instead of an empty space or some other object. A rock can also\nhave an odor that acts asa force on our sense of smell, o taste like something, although I haven't licked\nany rocks lately to find out. When we encounter anything in the envionment that expresses its\nproperties and characteristic, an exchange of energy takes place. Energy from the outside, in the form\n‘of whatever is expressing itself, gets transformed by our nervous system into electrical impulses and\nthen gets stored in our inner, mental environment. To be more specific, whatever we are seeing\nhearing, tasting, smelling, or feeling through our senses gets transformed into electrical impulses of",

You might be asking yourself, \"How does energy take\nshape of form?\" Before I answer this question, an even more fundamental question needs to be\naddressed.\n\nHow do we know that memories, distinctions, and beliefs exist in the form of energy inthe first place?\n1 dont know if i's been scientifically proven or completely accepted by the scientific community, but\nask yourself in what other form could these mental components exist? Here's what we know for sure:\nAnything composed of atoms and molecules takes up space and, therefore, can be observed. If\nmemories, distinctions, and beliefs existed in some physical form, then we should be able to observe\nthem.

If memories, distintions, and\nbeliefs don't exist as physical matter, then there really isn't any allerative way for them to exist except\n1s some form of energy.

Initially, the chart represented undifferentiated\ninformation, Undifferentiated information usually eretes a state of confusion, and that's probably what\nyou experienced when you first encountered a chat.\n\nGradually, however, you learned to make distinctions about that information, such as trends and trend\nlines, consolidations, support and resistance, retraeements or significant relationships between volume,\nand open interest and price action, just to name a few. You learned that each of these distinetions in the\nmarket s behavior represented an opportunity 10 fulfill some personal need, goal, or desire.

Would there be a difference between what you see now and what you saw then?\nAbsolutely. Instead of a bunch of undifferentiated lines, you would see everything you've learned about\nthose lines between then and now. In other words, you would see all the distinctions you've learned 10\nmake, as wel a all the opportunities those distinctions represent,\n\nYet, everything you can see as you look at that chart now existed then, and, furthermore, was available\nlo be perceived, What's the difference?

To illustrate this concept and make it even clearer, I am going to give you\nanother example, one that demonstrates how mental energy can affect how we perceive and experience\nthe environment in a way tha it actually reverses the cause-and-effect relationship. Let's look ata very\nyoung childs first encounter with a dog. Because it's a first-time experience, the child's mental\n‘environment is a clean slate, so 10 speak, with respect to dogs. He won't have any memories and\ncertainly no distinctions about a dog's nature. Therefore, up to the moment of his first encounter, from\nthe child's perspective, dogs don't exist. OF course, from the environment’ perspective, dogs do exist\nand they have the potential (0 act as a force on the child's senses to create an experience. In other\nwords, dogs expressing their nature ean act as a cause to produce an effect inside the child's mental\n‘environment, What kind of effect are dogs capable of producing? Well, dogs have a range of\nexpression, By range of expression I mean dogs ean behave in a number of ways toward humans.\n\n‘They can be fiendly, loving, protective, and fun to play with; or they can be hostile, mean, and\ndangerous—just to name a few of the many behaviors they'e capable of. All of these traits can be\n‘observed, experienced, and leaned about. When the child sees the dog for the frst time, there is\nabsolutely nothing in his mental environment to tell him what be is dealing with, Unfamiliar, unknown,\nand unclassified environmental information can generate a sense of curiosity —when we want to find\n‘out more about what we're experiencing—or it can generate a slate of confusion, which can easily turn\nlo fear if we can't place the information into an understandable or meaningful organizational\nframework or context. In our example, the child's sense of curiosity kicks in and he rushes to the dog to\ngel more sensory experience.\n\nNotice how children ate literally compelled to thrust themselves into a situation they know nothing\nabout, However, in this example, the environmental forces at hand do not react favorably tothe child's\nadvances, The dog the child is interested in is either inherently mean or having a bad day. In any case\n238 Soon as the child gets close enough, the dog bites him. The attack is so severe thatthe dog hus to be\npulled off the child. This kind of unfortunate experience is certainly not typical, but it's not that\nuncommon either. Ichose it for two reasons: First, most people can relate to it in some way either from\ntheir own direct experience or through the experience of someone they know. Second, as we analyze\nthe underlying dynamies ofthis experience from an energy perspective, we're going to learn about\n\n1) how our minds are designed to think,\n\n2) process information,\n\n3) how these processes affect what we experience and.\n\n4) our ability to recognize new possiblities.",

As they sat there, the bean market was slowly tending down to the price the\nanalyst said would be the support, or low, of the day.

The best traders\ntweat trading like a numbers game, similar to the way in which casinos and professional gamblers\napproach gambling. To illustrate, let's look at the game of blackjack. In blackjack, the casinos have\napproximately a 4.5-percent edge over the player, based on the rules they require players to adhere to.\n‘This means that, over a large enough sample size (number of hands played), the casino will generate\nnel profits of four and a half cents on every dollar wagered on the game. This average of four and a half\n‘ents takes into account all the players who walked away big winners (including all winning streaks),\nall the players who walked away big losers, and everybody in between. At the end of the day, week\n‘month, or year, the casino always ends up with approximately 45 percent ofthe total amount wagered,\n‘That 4.5 percent might not sound like a lot, but les put it in perspective. Suppose a total of $100\nnillion dollars is wagered collectively at all of a casino’s blackjack tables over the course of a year. The\n‘easing will net $4.5 million. What easino owners and professional gamblers understand about the\nnature of probabilities is that each individual hand played is statistically independent of every other\nhand. This means that each individual hand isa unique event, where the outcome is random relative 10\nthe last hand played or the next hand played. If you focus on each hand individually, there will be a\nrandom, unpredictable distibution between winning and losing hands. But on a collective basis, just\nthe opposite is true. Ifa large enough number of hands is played, patterns will emerge that produce a\nconsistent, predictable, and statistically reliable outcome.\n\nHere's what makes thinking in probabilities so difficult. It requires two layers of beliefs that on the\nsurface seem to contradict each other. We'll call the first layer the micro level. At this level, you have\nto believe in the uncertainty and unpredictability of each individual hand. You know the truth of this\nuncertainty, because there are always a number of unknown variables affecting the consistency of the\n‘deck that each new hand is drawn from. For example, you can't know in advance how any of the other\nparticipants will decide to play their hands, sine they can either take or decline additional cards. Any\nvariables acting on the consistency of the deck that can't be controlled oF known in advance will make\nthe outcome of any particular and both uncertain and random (statistically independent) in\nrelationship to any other hand. The second layer is the macro level. At this level, you have to believe\nthat the outcome over a series of hands played is relatively certain and predictable. The degree of\ncertainly is based on the fixed or constant variables that are known in advance and specifically\ndesigned to give an advantage (edge) to one side or the other.\n\n‘The constant variables Iam referring to are the rules of the game. So, even though you don't or couldn't\nknow in advance (unless you are psychic) the sequence of wins to losses, you can be relatively certain\nthat if enough hands are played, whoever has the edge will end up with more wins than losses. The\ndegree of cestainty is a function of how good the edge is. Ids the ability to believe in the\nunpredictability of the game at the micro level and simultaneously believe in the predictability of the\ngame atthe macro level that makes the casino and the professional gambler effective and sucessful at\n‘hat they do, Their belie in the uniqueness of each hand prevents them from engaging in the pointless",

But, ifthe consistency of the group of traders who are\n‘reating the paler \"now\" is different by even one person from the group that created the patter inthe\npast then the outcome of the current pattern has the potential to be different from the past pattern. (The\n‘example of the analyst and chairman illustrates this point quite well) It takes only one trader,\nsomewhere inthe world, with a different belief about the future to change the outcome of any particular\n‘market paler and negate the edge that pattern represents, The most fundamental characteristic of the\n‘market's behavior is that each “now moment” market situation, each “now moment” behavior pattern,\nand each \"now moment” edge is always a unique occurrence with its own outcome, independent of all\n‘others. Uniqueness implies that anything can happen, either what we know (expect or antiipate), or\nwhat we don't know (or can't know, unless we had extraordinary perceptual abilities). A constant flow\n‘of both known and unknown variables creates a probabilistic environment where we don't know for\ncertain what will happen next.\n\n‘This last statement may seem quite logical, even self-evident, but there's a huge problem here that is\nanything but logical or selfevident, Being aware of uncertainty and understanding the nature of\nprobabilities does not equate with an ability to actually function effectively from a probabilistic\nperspective. Thinking in probabilities can be difficult to master, because our minds don't naturally\nprocess information in this manner. Quite the contrary, our minds cause us to perceive what we know,\nand what we know is part of our past, whereas, in the market, every moment is new and unique, even\nthough there may be similarities to something that occurred inthe past. This means that unless we tain\n‘our minds to perceive the uniqueness of each moment, tial uniqueness will automaticaly be filtered\n‘out of our perception. We will perceive only what we know, minus any information that is blocked by\n‘our fears; everything else will remain invisible\n\n‘The bottom line is that there is some degree of sophistication to thinking in probabilities, which can\nlake some people a considerable amount of effort to integrate into their mental systems as a functional\nthinking strategy.

By the\nway he described the situation, it sounded to me as if this is exactly what happened to him.

Everyone's mental framework\nis unique for two fundamental reasons.\n\nFin, all of us were bom with different genetically encoded behavior and personality characteristics\nthat cause us to have different needs from one another. How positively oF negatively and to what\ndegree the environment responds to these needs creates experiences unique to each individual. Second,\n‘everyone is exposed to a variety of environmental forces. Some of these forces are similar from one\nindividual to the next, but none are exactly the same. If you consider the number of possible\n‘combinations of genetically encoded personality characteristies we ean be born with, in relation to the\nalmost infinite variety of environmental forces we can encounter throughout our lives, all of which\ncontribute to the construction of our mental framework, then it's not difficult to see why there is no\nuniversal mental framework common to everyone,\n\nUnlike our bodies, which have a common molecular structure that experiences physical pain, there is\nrho universal mind-set to assure us that we will share the potential negative oF positive effects of\ninformation in the same way. For example, someone could be projecting insults at you, intending 10\n‘eause you to feel emotional pain. From the environments perspective, this is negatively charged\ninformation, Wil you experience the intended negative effects? Not necessarily!

A belie, on the other hand, is a concept about the nature of the way the\n‘extemal environment expresses itself\n\nA concept combines pure sensory information with a symbol system we call language. For example,\n‘most infants have a pure memory of how i feels to be lovingly nurtured by a parent, bu itis until the\ninfant is taught to link or associate certain words with the pure sensory information stored in his\nmemory that he will form a concept about how it feels to be lovingly nurtured. The phrase “Life is\nwonderful” is a concept. By themselves, the words make up meaningless collection of abstract\nsymbols. But if a child is either taught or decides to connect these words to his positively charged\nfeelings of being nurtured, then the leters ate no longer a colletion of abstract symbols and the words\nare no longer an abstract phrase. \"Life is wonderful” becomes a definitive distintion about the nature\nof existence or the way the world works. By the same token, ifthe child didn't get enough nurturing,\nrelative to his needs, he could just as easily link his feelings of emotional pain to a concept like \"Life\nisnt fair” or \"The world is an awful place.” In any ease, when the positive or negative energy from our\nmemories or experiences become linked to a set of words we eall a concept, the concept becomes\n‘energized and, asa result, is transformed into a belief about the nature of reality. I’ you consider that\n‘concepts are structured by the framework of a language and energized by our experiences, it becomes\nlear why I refer to beliefs as \"structured energy.”\n\nWhen a belief comes into existence, what does it do?

The difference between them is in the amount of\nenergy they contain. The fist has virtually no energy: the second has energy. So from a functional\nperspective, there is no contradiction or conflict. I propose that, i is possible to render one belief\ninactive, then i's possible to de-activate any belief, despite the Fact that all beliefs seem to resist any\nforce that would alter their present form. The secret to effectively changing our beliefs is in\nunderstanding and, consequently, believing that we really aren't changing our belief; we are simply\ntcunsferring energy from one concept to another concept, one that we find more useful in helping us\nto fulfill our desires of achieve our goals.\n\n2. All active beliefs demand expression. Beliefs fll into two basic categories: ative and inactive. The\nistintion between the two is simple. Active beliefs are energized; they have enough energy to act\nas a force on our perception of information and on our behavior. An inactive belief is just the\n‘opposite. Its a belief, that for any number of reasons, no longer has energy, or has so litle energy\nthat i's no longer able to act as a force on how we perceive information or how we express\n‘ourselves. When I say that all active beliefs demand expression, I don't mean to imply that every\nbelief in our mental environment is demanding to express itself simultaneously. For example, if 1\nask you to think about what's wrong with the world today, the word \"wrong\" would bring to your\nmind ideas about the nature ofthe world that reflect what you believe to be troubling or disturbing.\nUnless, of course, there is nothing about the state of the world you find troubling. The point is, if\nthere is something you do believe is wrong, you weren't necessarily thinking about those ideas\nbefore asked the question; but the moment I did, your beliefs about these issues instantly moved to\nthe forefront of your conscious thinking process. In effect, they demanded to be heard. I say that\nbeliefs “demand” to be expressed because once something causes us to tap into our beliefs, it seems\na if we cant stop the flood of energy that’s released. This is especially true of emotionally sensitive\nissues or beliefS we feel particularly passionate about. You might ask, \"Why would I want to hold\nback expressing my beliefs” There could be several reasons, Consider a scenario in which you'e\nthis person is saying something that you completely disagree with, or even find utterly absurd, Will\nYou express your tuth or hold back? That will depend on the beliefs you have about what is proper\nin such a situation. If your beliefs dictate that speaking up would be inappropriate, and those beets\nhhave more energy than the ones that are being contradited, then you'll probably hold back and not\nargue openly.\n\nYou might be looking at this person (the boss) and nodding your head in agreement. But is your\nmind in agreement? More to the point, is your mind silent? Absolutely not! Your position on the\nissues being presented are effectively countering each point the boss is making. In other words, your\nbeliefs are still demanding expression, but they aren't being expressed externally (in the\nenvironment) because other beliefs are acting as a counteracting; force. However OO * they will\nsoon find a way to get out, won't they? As Soon as you are out ofthe situation, you will probably",

In other words, the driving conditions are such that\n‘operating out of one's subconscious skill is not enough.\nSELF EVALUATION AND TRADING.\nHow this characteristic applies to our trading is also quite profound. The trading environment offers us\nan arena of unlimited opportunities to accumulate wealth. But just because the money is available and\n\\we can perceive the possibilty of getting it, dhat doesnt necessarily mean that we (as individuals) have\ntn unlimited sense of selfvaluation. In other words, there could be a huge gap between how much\nmoney we desire for ourselves, how much we perceive is available, and how much we actually believe\nWe are worth or deserve. Everyone has a sense of self-valuation. The easiest way to describe this sense\nis to list every active belief, both conscious and subconscious, that has the potential to argue either for\n‘or against accumulating or achieving greater and greater levels of success and prosperity. Then match\nthe energy from the positively charged beliefs against the energy from the negatively charged beliefs. IF\nyou have more positively charged energy arguing for success and prosperity than negatively charged\n‘energy arguing against them, then you have positive sense of self-valuation. Otherwise, you have a\nnegative sense of self-valuation, The dynamics of how these beliefs interact with one another is not\nnearly so simple as Tim making it sound. In fact, it can be so complex that it could take years of\nsophisticated mental work to organize and sort out. What you need to know is that it almost\nimpossible to grow up in any social environment and not acquire some negatively charged beliefs that\nould argue against success or accumulating vast sums of money.",

How do we acquire\nself-sabotaging beliefs? Unfortunately, its extremely easy. Probably the most common way is when a\nchild engages in some activity that a parent or teacher doesn't want him to do and the child accidently\ninjures himself. Many parents, to ge thei point across tothe child, will respond toa situation like this\nby saying, \"This (whatever pain you are experiencing) wouldn't have happened to you if you didn't\ndeserve it” or \"You disobeyed me and look what happened, God punished you.\" The problem with\n‘making or hearing statements like this is tha there's a potential for the child to associate every future\ninjury with these same statements and, subsequently, form a belief that he must be an unworthy person,\nundeserving of suecess, happiness, or love. Anything we fel guilty about can have an adverse effect on\n‘our sense of sel-worth.\n\nUsually guilt is associated with being a bad person, and most people believe that bad people should be\npunished, certainly not rewarded. Some religions teach children that having a lot of money isn't godly\n‘or spiritual. Some people believe that making money in certain ways is wrong, even though it may be\nperfectly legal and moral from society's perspective. Again, you may not have a speoifir recollection of\nlearning something that would argue against the success you perceive as possible, but that doesnt mean\nthat what you learned is no longer having an effect. The way these subconscious self-sabotaging beliefs\n‘manifest themselves in our trading is usually inthe form of lapses in focus or concentration, resulting\nin any number of trading errors, like putting in a buy for a sell or vice versa, or allowing yourself 10\ngive in to distracting thoughts that compel you to leave the sereen, only to find out when you return that\nyou missed the big trade of the day.\n\nTye worked with many traders who achieved various levels of consistent success, but found they just\n‘couldn't break through certain thresholds in acquiring equity. They discovered an invisible but very real\nburtier similar tothe proverbial glass ceiling that many women executives experience in the corporate\nWorld. Every time these traders hit the barter, they experienced a significant draw down, regardless of\nthe market conditions. However, when asked about what happened, they typically blamed their sudden\nrun of bad luck on just that—luck or the vagaries of the market. Interestingly, they typically ereated a\nsteadily rising equity curve, sometimes over a period of several months, and the significant draw down,\nalways occurred atthe sume spot in their equity curve\n\nI describe this psychological phenomenon as being in a “negative zone.” As magically as money can\nflow into a trader's accounts when he is \"in the zone,” ican just as easily low out, ihe is in a negative\nzone where unresolved sel-valuation issues mysteriously act on his perception of information and\nbehavior. I am not implying here that you have to de-aetivate every belief that would argue against\nyour ever-expanding positive sense of selfvaluation, because you don't. But you must be aware of the\npresence of such beliefs, and take specific steps in your trading regimen to compensate when they start\n‘expressing themselves",

At the end of this\nfirst week, I was really surprised to discover even a litte bit of exercise improved my stamina and\nability o run a lite farther each time. This ereated even more enthusiasm, so I went out and bought a\nstop watch and blank book to be used a a running diary. I set up a two-mile course, and marked off\n‘each quarter mile. In the diary Tentered the date, my distance, my time, and how I fet physically each\ntime Iran. Now I thought I was well on my way to the five miles, unl I iterally ran into my next set of\nproblems.\n\n‘The biggest were the conflicting and distracting thoughts that flooded my consciousness every time I\ndecided I wanted to go out and run. I was amazed at the number (and intensity) ofthe reasons I found\nfor not doing it \"W's hot [or] cold outside,” \"IL 1ooks like it’ going to ran,” \"Tm stil alittle tired from\nthe last ime I ran (even though it was three days ago),” \"Nobody else I know is doing this,” or the most\nprevalent, \"Tl go as soon as this TV program is over\" (of course I never went. I didn't know any other\n\\way to deal with this conflicting mental energy except to redireet my conscious attention on what I was\nluying to accomplish, I really wanted to get to five miles by the end of the summer. I found that\nsometimes my desire was stronger than the conflict, As a result, I managed to get my running shoes on,\nsctualy step outside, and start running. However, more times than not, my conflicting and distracting\nthoughts caused me to stay put, In fact, inthe beginning stages, I estimate that two-thirds ofthe time I\nwas unable to get past the conflicting energy.\n\n‘The next problem I encountered was that when I started approaching the point where I was able to run\n‘one mile, 1 was so thrilled with myself that it aceurred to me I was going to need an additional\nmechanism to get me to the five miles. I reasoned that once I got tothe point where I could run two oF\n‘maybe three miles, I would be so overwhelmingly pleased with myself that I wouldn't feel any need 10\nfulfil my five-mile objective. So I made a rule for myself. You could call it the five-mile rule. \"ICT\nmanaged to get my running shoes on and get outside in spite ofall the conflicting thoughts trying to\ntalk me out of i, I committed myself to running at least one step farther than the last time Tran.” It was\n‘certainly all right if Tran more than one step further, but it couldnt be less than one step, no matter\nwhat, As it tums out, I never broke this rule, and by the end of the summer, I made it to five miles.",

At that point, I found that iT wanted to run, I was completely free 10\n{do so without any mental resistance, conflict, or competing thoughts. Given what a struggle it had been,\n1 was amazed (Wo say the least). The result: I went on to run on a very regular basis for the next 16\nyears. For those of you who may be interested, I don't run so much now because five years ago I\ndecided to start playing ice hockey agai,\n\nHockey is an extemely strenuous sport, Sometimes I play as many as four times a week.

Now, if you take these experiences and\npul them into the context of what we now understand about the nature of beliefs, there are a number of\n‘observations we can make:\n\n|. Initially, my desire to be a runner had no foundation of support in my mental system, In other words,\nthere was no other source of energy (an energized concept demanding expression) consistent with my\ndesire.\n\n2, Tetually had to do something to create that support. To create a belief that \"I am a runner required\nthat Iereate a series of experiences consistent with the new belief. Remember that everything we think,\nsay, oF do contributes energy to some belief in our mental system. Each time I experienced a\n‘conflicting thought and was able to successfully refocus on my objective, with enough conviction to get\n‘me into my running shoes and out the door, I added energy tothe belief that \"Lam a runner.” And, just\n1s important, inadvertently drew energy avvay from all ofthe beliefs that would argue otherwise. I suy\ninadvertently because there are various techniques specifically designed to identify and de-aetivate\nconflicting beliefs, but at that time in my life, I didn't understand the underlying dynamics of the\nprocess of transformation I was going through. So, it wouldnt have oceured to me to avail myself of\nsuch techniques\n\n3. Now I can effortlessly (from a mental perspective) express myself as a runner, because \"T am a\nrunner.” That energized concept is now a functioning part of my identity. When I first started out, I\nhappened to have a number of conflicting beliefs about running. As a result, [needed the technique of\nself-discipline to b{CCITic One. Now I don't need self-discipline because \"bHn” a. xiier\"'e who IL -\n~o am.” When our bfelies are completely aligned with our goals or desires, there's no source of\nconflicting energy. If there's no source of conllicting energy, then there's no source of distracting\nthoughts, excuses, rationalizations, justifications, or mistakes (conscious or subconscious).\n\n4, Beliefs can be changed, and if i's possible to change one belief, then i's possible to change any\nbelief, if you understand that you really arent changing them, but are only transferring energy from one\nconcept to another. (The form of the belief targeted for change remains intact) Therefore, two\n‘completely contradictory beliefs can exist in your mental system, side by side. But if you've drawn the",

For example, if you use variables that identify\n«8 particular support and resistance pattern on a 30-minute bar chart, then your risk and profit objective\n‘calculations also have tobe determined in 8 30-minute time frame. However, trading in one time frame\n‘does not preclude you from using other time frames as filters. For example, you could have asa filler &\nrule that states you're only going to take trades that are in the direction of the major trend. There's an\n‘old trading axiom that \"The trend is your friend.” It means that you have a higher probability of success\n\\when you trade inthe direction of the major tend, i[there is one. In fact, the lowestrsk trade, with the\nhighest probability of suecess, occurs when you are buying dips (support) in an up-trending market or\nselling rallies (resistance) in a down-trending market. To illustrate how this rule works, le’s say that\nyou've chosen a precise way of identifying support and resistance patterns in a 30- minute time frame\nas your edge. The rule is that you are only going to take trades in the direction of the major tend. A.\ntrending market is defined as a series of higher highs and higher lows for an up-trending market and a\nseries of lower highs and lower lows for a downtrending market.

Therefore, the trend on the daly bar chart would take precedence over\nthe wend on the 30-minute bar chart and would be considered the major rend\n\nTo determine the direction of the major rend, look at what is happening on a daily bar chart. I the\ntrend is up on the daily, you are only going to look fora sell-off or retracement down to what your edge\ndefines as support on the 30-minute chart. That's where you will become a buyer. On the other hand, if\nthe trend is down on the daily, you are only going to look for a rally up to what your edge defines as a\nresistance level to be a seller on the 30-minute chart. Your objective is to determine, in a down\nleending market, how fur it can rally on an intraday basis and stil not violate the symmetry of the\nlonger rend. In an up-trending market, your objective is to determine how far it can sell off on an\nintraday basis without violating the symmetry of the longer tend.

Because the object of the belief is winning\n‘consistently, how you take profits in a winning trade is of paramount importance. This is the only part\n‘of the exercise in which you will have some degree of discretion about what you do. The underlying\npremise is that, in a winning trade, you never know how far the market is going to go in your direction\nMarkets rarely go stright up or straight down, (Many of the NASDAQ Internet stocks in the fall of\n1999 were an obvious exception to this statement.) Typically, markets go up and then retrace some\nportion of the upward move: or go down and then retrace some portion of the downward move. These\nproportional reiracee\"nts ean make it very dificult to stay in a winning trade. You would have to be an\n‘extremely sophisticated and objective analyst o make the distinction between a normal retracement,\nwhen the market still has the potential to move inthe original direction of your trade, and a etracement\nthat isnt normal, when the potential for any further movement in the original direction of your trade is\nreally diminished, if not nonexistent\n\nIf you never know how far the market is going to go in your direction, then when and how do you take\nprofits? The question of when isa function of your ability to ead the market and pick the most likely\nspots for it to stop. In the absence of an ability to do this objectively, the best course of action from a\npsychological perspective is to divide your postion into thirds (or quarters), and scale out the position\nas the market moves in your favor. If you are trading futures contracts this means your minimum\nposition for a trade is atleast three (or four) contracts. For stocks, the minimum position is any number\n‘of shares that is divisible by three (or four), so you dont end up with an odd-lot order. Here's the way 1\nscale out ofa winning position. When I first started trading, especially during the first three years (1979\nUrough 1981), I would thoroughly and regularly analyze the results of my trading activites. One of the\nthings I discovered was that Iarely got stopped out of a trade for a loss, without the market frst going\nat Ieast a litle way in my direction. On average, only one out of every ten trades was an immediate\nloser that never went in my direction. Out of the other 25 to 30 percent of the trades that were\nUltimately losers, the market usually went in my direction by three or four ties before revising and\nstopping me out, I calculated that i got into the habit of taking a least a third of my original position\n‘off every time the market gave me those three or four ties, at the end of the year the accumulated\nWinnings would go a long way towards paying my expenses. I was right. To this day, I always, without\nreservation or hesitation, take off a portion of a Winning position whenever the market gives me a Tile\nto take.\n\nHow much that might be depends on the market; it will be a different amount in each case. For\n‘example, in Treasury bond futures, I take a third of my postion off when I get four tes. In the S&P\nfutures, [take a third off fora profit of one and a half to two full points.

I place my\n‘order to liquidate just below that spot in a long position or just above that spot in a short position. 1\nplace my orders just above or just below because I don't care about squeezing the last tie out of the\ntrade. Ihave found over the years that trying to do that just isnt worth it. One other factor you need to\nlake into consideration is your rsk-to-reward ratio. The risk-o-reward ratio isthe dollar value of how\n‘much risk you have to take relative to the profit potential. Ideally, your risk-o-reward rato should be at\nleast 3:1, which means you are only risking one dollar for every three dollars of profit potential. If your\n‘edge and the way you scale out of your trades give you a 3:1 risk-to-reward ratio, your winning trade\npercentage can be less than S0 percent and you wil still make money consistently. A 3:1 risk-to-reward\nratio is ideal. However, forthe purposes of ths exercise, it doesnt matter what iti, nor does it matter\nhow effectively you scale out, as long as you do it. Do the best you can to pay yourself at reasonable\nprofit Ievels when the market makes the money available, Every portion ofa trade that you take off as a",

AU the numbers will eventually\n‘come into better alignment as your belief in your ability to be consistent becomes stronger.\n\nTrading in Sample Sizes. The typical trader practically lives or dies (emotionally) on the results of the\nmost recent trade. IFit was a winner, he'll gladly go to the next wade; i it wasn', hel start questioning\nthe viability of his edge. To find out what variables work, how well they work, and what doesn't work,\nWwe need a systematic approach, one that doesn't take any random variables into consideration, This\nrmeuns that we have {0 expand our definition of success or failure from the limited trade-by-trade\nperspective of the typical trader to a sample size of 20 trades or more. Any edge you decide on will be\nbased on some limited number of market variables or relationships between those variables that\nrmeusure the markets potential to move either up or down. From the market's perspective, each trader\nWho has the potential to put on or take off a trade can act as a force on price movement and is,\ntherefore, a market variable. No edge or technical system ean take into consideration every trader and\nhis reasons for putting on or taking off a rade. As a result, any set of market variables that defines an\n‘edge i like a snapshot of something very fluid, capturing only a limited portion of al the possibilities.\nWhen you apply any set of variables to the market, they may work very well over an extended period\n‘of time, but after while you may find that their effectiveness diminishes. That's because the\nunderlying dynamics of the interuetion between all the participants (dhe market) is changing. New\ntraders come into the market with their own unique ideas of what is high and what is low, and other\ntraders leave.\n\nLite by litle, these changes affect the underlying dynamics of how the market moves. No snapshot\n(igid set of variables) can take these subtle changes into consideration, You can compensate for these\nsubtle changes in the underlying dynamies of market movement and still maintain a consistent\napproach by trading in sample sizes. Your sample size has to be large enough to give your variables a\nfair and adequate tes, but atthe same time small enough so tha if their effectiveness diminishes, you\n‘ean detect it before you lose an inordinate amount of money. [have found that a sample size of atleast\n20 trades fulfils both of these requirements,\n\nTesting. Once you decide on a set of variables that conform to these specifications, you need to test\nthem to see how well they work. If you have the appropriate software to do this, you are probably\nalready familiar with the procedures. If you don't have testing software, you can either forward test\nYour Variables or hire a testing service to do it for you. If you need a recommendation for a testing\nservice, contact me at markdouglas.com or tradinginthezone.com for a referral. In any ease, keep in\n‘ind thatthe object of the exercise is to use trading as a vehicle to learn how to think objectively (in\nthe marker’ perspective), as if you were a casino operator. Right now, the bottom-line performance of\nYour system isn't very important, bu i is important that you have a good idea of what you ean expect\nin the way of a win-to-loss ratio (the number of winning trades relative to the number of losing trades",

      "formula": "for your sample size).\n\nAccepting the Risk. A requirement ofthis exercise is that you know in advance exactly what your risk\nis on each trade in your 20- trade sample size. As you now know, knowing the risk and accepting the\nrisk are two different things. I want you to be as comfortable as possible with the dollar value of the\nrisk you are taking in this exercise, Becuse the exercise requires that you use a 20-trade sample size, the\npotential risk is that you will lose on all 20 trades. This is obviously the worst-case scenario Its as\nlikely an occurrence as that you willwin on all 20 trades, which means it isnt very likely. Nevertheless,\nitis a possiblity. Therefore, you should set up the exercise in such a way that you ean accept the risk\n(in dollar value) of losing om all 20 trades.\n\nFor example, if you're trading S&P futures, your edge might require that you risk thre full points per\n‘contract to find out ifthe trade is going to work. Since the exercise requites that you trade & minimum\n‘of three contracts per trade, the total dollar value of the risk per trade is $2.250, if you use big contracts\n‘The accumulated dollar value of risk if you lose on all 20 trades is $45,000, You may not be\n‘comfortable risking $45,000 on this exercise\n\nIf you're not comfortable, you can reduce the dollar value of the risk by trading S&P mini contracts (E-\nMini). They are one-fifth the value ofthe big contracts, so the total dollar value of the visk per trade\ngoes down to $450 and the accumulated risk forall 20 trades is $9,000. You ean do the same thing if\nyou are trading stocks: Just keep on reducing the number of shares per trade until you get to a point\nWhere you are comfortable with the total accumulated risk forall 20 trades. What I don't want you to\n‘dois change your established risk parameters to satisfy your comfort levels,\n\nIf, based on your research, you have determined that a three-point risk in the S&Ps is the optimum\ndistance you must let the market trade against your edge to tell you i isnt worth staying inthe position,\nthen leave it at three points. Change this variable only if it is warranted from a technical analysis\nperspective. If you've done everything possible to reduce your postion size and find that you sil aren't\n‘comfortable with the accumulated dollar value of losing on all 20 trades, then I suggest you do the\n‘exercise with a simulated brokerage service. With a simulated brokerage service, everything about the\nprocess of putting on and taking off trades, including fills and brokerage statements, is exactly the same\n1s with an actual brokerage firm, except that the trades are not actully entered into the market. AS a\nresult, you don't actually have any money at risk, A simulated brokerage service is an excellent to to\npractice with in real time, under real market conditions: its also an excellent tool for forward testing a\ntrading system. There may be others, but the only service of this nature that I know of is\nAuditrack.com.\n\nDoing the Exercise. When you have a set of variables that conforms to the specifications described,\nyou know exaetly what each trade is going to cost to Find out if i's going to work, you have a plan for\ntaking profits, and you know what you can expect as a win-loss ratio for your sample size, then you are",

      "formula": "ready to begin the exercise. The rules are simple: Trade your system exactly as you have designed i\n‘This means you have to commit yourself to trading atleast the next 20 occurrences of your edge—not\njust the next trade or the next couple of trades, but all 20, no matter what, You cannot deviate, use or be\ninfluenced by any other extraneous factors, or change the variables that define your edge until you have\n‘completed a full sample size. By setting up the exercise with rigid variables that define your edge,\nrelatively fixed odds, and a commitment to take every trade in your sample size, you have created a\ntrading regime that duplicates how a casino operates.\n\nWhy do casinos make consistent money on an event that has random outcome? Because they know\nthat over a series of events, the ods are in their favor. They also know that to realize the benefits of the\nfavorable odds, they have to participate in every event. They cant engage in a process of picking and\n‘choosing which hand of blackjack, spin of the roulette wheel, or roll of the dice they are going to\nparticipate in, by trying to predict in advance the outcome of each of these individual events. If you\nbelieve in the five fundamental truths and you believe that trading is jut a probability game, not much\ndifferent from pulling the handle of a slot machine, then youll find that this exercise will be\neffortless —elfortless because your desire to follow through with your commitment to take every trade\nin your sump size and your belie in the probabilistic nature of trading will be in complete harmony,\n‘Asa result, there will be no fear, resistance, or distracting thoughts. What could stop you from doing\n‘exactly what you need to do, when you need to doit, without reservation or hesitation? Nothing!\n\nOn the other hand, if it hasn't already occurred to you, this exercise is going to create a head-on\ncollision between your desire to think objectively in probabilities and all the forces inside you that are\nin conflict with this desire. The amount of difficulty you have in doing this exercise will be in direct\nproportion to the degree to which these conflicts exist. To one degree or another, you will experience\nthe exaet opposite of what I described in the previous paragraph, Don't be surprised if you find your\nfirst couple of attempts at doing this exercise virally impossible. How should you handle these\n‘conflicts? Monitor yourself and use the technique of self-discipline to refocus on your objective. Write\n‘down the five fundamental truths and the seven principles of consistency, and keep them in front of you\nall times when you ate trading.\n\nRepeat them to yourself frequently, with conviction. Every time you notice that you are thinking\nsaying, or doing something that is inconsistent with these truths or principles, acknowledge the conflict.\nDon't try to deny the existence of conflicting forces. They are simply parts of your psyche that are\n(understandably) arguing for their versions of the tuth. When this happens, refocus on exactly what\nyou are tying to accomplish. If your purpose is to think objectively, disrupt the association process (so\nyou ean stay in the \"now moment opportunity flow\"); step through your fears of being wrong, losing\n‘money, missing out, and leaving money on the table (so you can stop making errors and start trusting\nyoursel) then youll know exactly what you need to do. Follow the rules of your trading regime as best\nyou can. Doing exactly what your rules call for while focused on the five fundamental truths will\n‘eventually resolve all your conflicts about the true nature of trading. Every time you actually do",
