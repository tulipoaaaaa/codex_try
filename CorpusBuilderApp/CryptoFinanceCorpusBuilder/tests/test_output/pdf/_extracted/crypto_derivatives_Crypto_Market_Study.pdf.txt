CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY4
Executive Summary
In recent years, the market for financial products and services associated to crypto assets has expanded 
quickly, becoming more and more integrated into the regulated financial system. The crypto asset market 
has grown significantly overall and shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon. The potential for 
blockchain technology and crypto assets to transform numerous industries still exists, despite the industry's 
regulatory and other difficulties. 
The term ‘crypto assets’ has been adopted as it encapsulates and is seen as a broader, or ‘umbrella’ , 
term for different crypto asset tokens used for a variety of uses. South African consumers are increasingly 
engaging in financial activities involving crypto assets, including investing in derivative instruments with 
crypto as the underlying asset, especially given the proliferation of online trading platforms. Heightened 
take-up and abuse in the retail market necessitates a suitable and proportionate regulatory and supervisory 
response. The volatility of crypto assets, coupled with the high gearing of derivative instruments poses 
significant risks to customers. 
In October 2022, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) officially declared crypto assets as a 
financial product in terms of the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act (FAIS). This means that 
any individual or business that provides financial advice or intermediary services in respect of crypto 
assets – what is typically understood to be a “broker” or “advisor” - will have to register as an FSP. The 
Declaration in effect puts in place a regulatory and licensing regime for persons providing financial 
services in respect of crypto assets. With the declaration on place, it is not necessarily tailored around 
crypto assets services providers, and the specific risks posed in the crypto asset environment. Therefore, 
there is need to develop bespoke and/or refine further the existing framework to ensure that it is fit for 
purpose and addresses crypto asset specific risk, without stifling innovation in a significant manner. 
To better understand the crypto asset-related activities performed by Crypto Asset Financial Service 
Providers (FSPs) in South Africa, the FSCA, in accordance with paragraph 3(2) of FSCA FAIS Notice 90 
of 2022, requested Crypto Asset FSPs to furnish the authority with information relating to their business and 
business practices. The information gathered is intended to support the work of the FSCA, particularly in 
relation to the development of licensing, supervision, and regulatory frameworks for Crypto Asset FSPs, by 
highlighting consumer exposure to crypto assets; and in line with risk-based supervision, identify risks that 
may negatively impact consumer well-being.
The information gathered suggests that the majority of Crypto Asset FSPs in South Africa provide financial 
services by making use of unbacked crypto assets, followed by stablecoins and security tokens. Most 
unbacked crypto assets are used for speculative purposes rather than as a medium of exchange. Further, 
the observed crypto assets-related business models are diverse. However, in some instances, the business 
models mirror traditional financial activities such as operating an exchange or providing advice. These 
activities require consumers to trust centralised entities which is against the disintermediation function that 
crypto assets were designed for. 
CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY5
Other findings include: 
•	Almost all Crypto Asset FSPs claim to disclose risks relating to crypto asset activities to their customers 
and the public. 
•	Cape Town leads the way in head office location. The results bear testimony to the fact that Cape 
Town is considered the largest technology hub in Africa. 
•	The majority of Crypto Asset FSPs earn their revenue from trading fees and most of the remuneration 
models identified mirror traditional financial revenue models.
•	The majority of crypto assets Crypto Asset FSPs have interventions in place to handle complaints. 
However, these interventions would need to be coordinated with the management and processing 
of complaints related to the Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) outcomes.
•	More than half of the Crypto Asset FSPs have built their businesses around retail customers. 
Understanding the extent of retail participation over time will be critical in assessing the consumer 
protection risk and impact of this market.
The information gathered will assist the FSCA in enhancing its approach to licensing and supervision 
of crypto asset activities, with a view to appropriately mitigate risk in this environment, thereby ensuring 
better financial customer outcomes in the crypto asset environment. This is anticipated to enable the 
authority to make more informed decisions concerning the potential future regulation for crypto asset-
related activities.

CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY6
1. Introduction
Crypto assets and its associated products and services have grown rapidly in recent years, becoming 
increasingly interlinked with the regulated financial system. While the industry faces regulatory and other 
challenges, the potential for blockchain technology and crypto assets to transform the financial sector 
remains significant. 
The crypto economy in Sub-Saharan Africa is the smallest among all regions, accounting for 2.3% of 
the global transaction volume from July 2022 to June 2023. In the same time frame, the region attracted 
an approximate total of $1 1 7 . 1 billion in on-chain value1. While Sub-Saharan Africa consistently stands 
as one of the smaller cryptocurrency markets, a closer analysis reveals that cryptocurrency has made 
significant inroads among key populations. Nigeria exemplifies this better, ranking second on the 2023 
Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index2. Other countries in the region that score high on the index 
include Kenya (2 1), Ghana (29), and South Africa (3 1). Further, a 2022 study by Triple A (Singapore 
Blockchain company) indicates that over 5.8 million people, 9.44% of South Africa’s total population - 
currently own crypto assets, with 43% of the population expected to be using them by 20303.
Retail customers use crypto assets for transacting and speculation/investment but were - until now – 
largely unprotected, often investing in products without understanding the risks and complexities of the 
instruments. Moreover, crypto assets are increasingly being used as the underlying assets in derivative 
instruments and becoming more popular with retail customers with the proliferation of online trading 
platforms. 
In general, governments and regulators are grappling with how to regulate the crypto asset ecosystem 
given its decentralised nature and global reach. Regulatory challenges often relate to jurisdiction and 
understanding how Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) fit into the existing financial sector laws and 
supervisory landscape. More severe challenges include preventing money laundering and other illegal 
activities, protecting investors from scams and fraud, and monitoring the potential financial stability of the 
financial system.
The regulation of crypto assets varies depending on the country and region.

CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY7
When considering crypto asset regulation, there are essentially three approaches available4:
1. Ban:  Some countries have completely banned the use of crypto assets, such as China, Algeria, Bolivia, 
and Egypt.
2. Regulate:  Some countries have given legal recognition to crypto assets, often with licensing restrictions, 
such as Japan, the United States of America (US), Canada, the European Union (EU), and Australia. 
In these countries, crypto assets are regulated under existing laws and financial regulations, such 
as Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC), and tax laws. These may include 
registration and licensing. In some cases, crypto assets may be classified as securities and subject to 
securities regulation. Some countries have consumer protection laws that apply to crypto assets, which 
may include restrictions on advertising, disclosure requirements, and measures to prevent fraud and 
scams. Central banks in some countries regulate crypto assets to control the money supply, monitor the 
potential impact on financial stability, and prevent money laundering and other illicit activities.
3. Wait and learn:  Some countries have opted to observe and monitor crypto asset innovation before 
intervening. Over time, as the regulators gain capacity around crypto assets innovation and the 
technology becomes more commonly adopted, policymakers may incrementally amend or change 
existing regulations. For instance, The Central Bank of Ireland does not have specific crypto assets 
regulation, and there is no prohibition of crypto assets activities within Ireland. Instead, the Central 
Bank of Ireland has taken a “do nothing” approach to the regulation of crypto assets. 
In addition to government regulation, there are also self-regulatory organizations within the crypto industry, 
such as the Crypto Rating Council (CRC) and the Blockchain Association (BA), which are working to 
establish standards and best practices for the industry.
1.1 Recent regulatory developments
1.1.1 International context
Throughout the world, several jurisdictions have implemented various regulations for crypto assets, creating 
a fragmented regulatory environment. The degree and range of these regulations are determined by 
several factors, including the stage at which the cryptocurrency ecosystem is developing, perceived 
threats to the stability of the financial system, the capacity of the regulatory bodies in charge of regulating 
cryptocurrency assets, the intention to promote innovation, and other regionally specific factors5. These 
factors combine differently for every country, creating a complex regulatory environment where some 
countries (like China) banned the use of cryptocurrency, while other countries (like El Salvador6 and the 
Central African Republic) have made certain cryptocurrency assets (like Bitcoin) officially recognised as 
legal money7.

1.1.2 Local context
In South Africa, the Crypto Assets Regulatory Working Group (CAR WG) of the Intergovernmental Fintech 
Working Group (IFWG)9  published the final Position Paper (CAR Paper) on crypto assets for South Africa 
in June 202 110. The CAR Paper signalled a regulatory and policy response to crypto assets activities in 
South Africa.
The CAR WG Paper made 25 recommendations for crypto assets and related activities and essentially 
provides a roadmap for a regulatory framework for CASPs. The CAR Paper proposed the FSCA to be the 
regulatory authority to license, supervise and investigate Crypto Asset FSPs.

9 The IFWG is a collaborative effort and resultant body of several South African financial sector regulators, including 
National Treasury, the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC), the FSCA, the National Credit Regulator (NCR), the South 
African Reserve Bank (SARB) South African Revenue Service (SARS) and the Competition Commission

CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY9
In line with the crypto assets developments that were happening within the IFWG CAR WG, in November 
2020 the FSCA published for public consultation a draft Declaration of crypto assets as a financial 
product under the FAIS Act. This proposed Declaration signalled the FSCA’s acute interest in CASPs and 
was put forward as an interim step to mitigate conduct and consumer protection risks in the crypto asset 
environment, pending the anticipated Conduct of Financial Institutions (COFI) Bill framework and the 
broader policy discussions taking place at the time through the CAR WG. 
In October 2022, the FSCA officially declared crypto assets as a financial product in terms of the FAIS 
Act11. This means that any individual or business that provides financial advice or intermediary services in 
respect of crypto assets – what is typically understood to be a “broker” or “advisor” - will have to register 
as an FSP. The Declaration in effect puts in place a regulatory and licensing regime for persons providing 
financial services in respect of crypto assets. Crypto Asset FSPs12 must be licensed and will be subject to 
the FSCA’s oversight and supervision.13
Following the declaration, in December 2022 the FSCA published an Information Request in accordance 
with paragraph 3(2) of FSCA FAIS Notice 90 of 2022, requesting Crypto Asset FSPs to furnish the 
authority with information relating to their business and business practices.
Broader developments surrounding crypto assets will likely be given effect through the COFI Bill, which 
constitutes the future consolidated legal framework governing the conduct of all financial institutions. 
Financial services related to crypto assets will likely be included in the licensing activities under the COFI 
Bill, potentially expanding the scope of crypto asset activities that are currently regulated under the FAIS 
Act.
After declaring crypto assets as a financial product, the FSCA remains of the view that crypto asset 
related activities pose significant risks to financial customers. While there is a legal framework is in place, 
it is not necessarily tailored around crypto assets services providers, and the specific risks posed in the 
crypto asset environment. Therefore, there is need to develop bespoke and/or refine further the existing 
framework to ensure that it is fit for purpose and addresses crypto asset specific risk, without stifling 
innovation in a significant manner. 
Further, the regulation of crypto asset related activities is a new development and the FSCA is still unpacking 
the specific risks inherent in this environment. To regulate effectively, the FSCA needs to develop a deeper 
understanding of these risks and market dynamics to enable it to refine its approach to licensing and 
supervising of crypto asset activities with a view to appropriately mitigate risk in this environment, thereby 
ensuring better financial customer outcomes in the crypto asset environment.

3. Purpose
4. Research ApproachThe purpose of this research is to assist the FSCA to better understand crypto asset related activities 
performed by Crypto Asset FSPs14 in South Africa, in order to: 
i. Support the work of the FSCA, particularly in relation to the development of licensing, supervision, 
and regulatory frameworks for Crypto Asset FSPs, by highlighting consumer exposure to crypto 
assets; and 
ii. In line with risk-based supervision, identify risks that may negatively impact consumer well-being, in 
support of the FSCA’s regulatory and supervisory approaches.
The study employed a “mixed methods” approach. The FSCA obtained information related to crypto 
assets-related activities in South Africa directly from Crypto Asset FSPs, by issuing an Information Request 
in December 202215. In terms of the Financial Sector Regulatory Authority (FSRA) 9 of 20 1 7 , the FSCA is 
empowered to request information from regulated persons in the fulfilment of its objectives and functions16.
  
The purpose of the Information Request is to assist the authority in obtaining a better understanding 
of crypto asset-related activities that Crypto Asset FSPs are currently performing in the crypto asset 
environment, in turn, to better understand related conduct risks.
Information submitting by the Crypto Asset FSPs was augmented by desk-based research. The desk-
based research drew information from different sources, including policy and academic texts, and 
national and international datasets from both public and private stakeholders.

The scope of the Information Request included crypto assets-related activities performed and business 
practices of Crypto Asset FSPs in South Africa as at December 2022. 
The Information Request covered: 
i. Crypto Asset FSP supply-side driving factors;
ii. Crypto Asset FSP outsourcing arrangements; 
iii. Crypto Asset FSP business models;
iv. Crypto Asset Market dynamics;
v. Crypto Asset FSP demand-side driving factors; and 
vi. Complaints.
This section provides an overview of the crypto asset ecosystem, taxonomy, market essential functions, and 
activities. The section sets the stage for the evaluation in section 7 , which looks in more detail at the Crypto 
Asset FSP activities in South Africa.
6.1 Crypto Asset Ecosystem 
For the purposes of this paper, the definition of crypto asset is adopted from the IFWG CAR WG 
Position Paper on Crypto Assets. The paper defines crypto asset as17: 
i. a digital representation of value that is not issued by a central bank, but is capable of being traded, 
transferred or stored electronically by natural and legal persons for the purpose of payment, investment 
and other forms of utility; 
ii. applies cryptographic techniques; and 
iii. uses distributed ledger technology (DLT).

6. Overview of the Crypto Assets 
Operating Environment
CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY12
Various naming conventions have been used over the years by ecosystem participants, from ‘digital 
tokens’ and ‘digital assets’ to ‘cryptocurrency’ and ‘crypto assets’. Considering naming conventions, the 
central banks, in particular, have been reluctant to refer to these digital representations on blockchain 
ledgers as ‘currency’ as it is not deemed to be a form of legal tender or fiat currency. 
The regulatory authorities have taken a functional approach, focusing on the economic activities being 
performed, compared to a more generic, ‘all-encompassing’ classification. It is acknowledged that 
crypto assets may perform certain functions similar to those of ‘traditional’ currencies, securities, or 
financial products and commodities.
The term ‘crypto assets’ is thus preferred and has been adopted by the Intergovernmental Fintech Working 
Group, as it encapsulates and extends to these functions. ‘Crypto assets’ are seen as a broader, or 
‘umbrella’ , term for different crypto asset tokens used for a variety of uses.

CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY13
Regarding the functioning and organisation of the crypto assets market, Box 1 below gives a detailed 
description of the various participants in and components of the crypto asset market: 
Box 1: Key Crypto Asset Ecosystem Components and Actors
1. Blockchain  is the foundation of the crypto assets’ ecosystem, a type of distributed ledger 
where transactions are recorded, and participants transact with other participants and 
decentralised applications.
2. Customers  in the crypto-assets market take part and are involved in transactions. They could 
be individuals, institutions, and businesses. 
3. Financial intermediaries  such as brokers provide advice or facilitate the purchase of crypto 
assets by investors. 
4. System administrators  such as crypto assets issuers (this includes those who issue tokens 
through an Initial Coin Offering - ICO18) and auditors (allowed to view the ledger but not 
allowed to make changes). They issue crypto assets, decide who can access the network, 
and maintain and administer dispute resolution rules. 
5. Miners/validators  and transaction processors , who are incentivised by remuneration to 
verify transactions and add them to the ledger. 
6. Trading platforms and exchanges  facilitate transactions between participants and ensure 
a liquid market. 
7. Payment providers  enable customers to pay for services or goods received using a crypto 
asset. 
8. Wallet providers  enable customers to make coin transactions and secure the storage of 
crypto assets.
For traditional financial institutions, avoiding crypto assets entirely may not be possible. Although banks 
may prohibit certain types of crypto asset transactions (e.g. blacklisting certain counterparties), it may 
not be feasible for them to fully unplug from the crypto assets’ ecosystem if their customers or third parties 
remain involved in it. For instance, if customers can engage in crypto asset transactions, even outside 
of the perimeter of traditional financial institutions, then the flow of funds through their accounts may 
represent a risk related to money laundering or fraud.
18 An initial coin offering (ICO) is a type of capital-raising activity in the crypto assets and blockchain environment. 
The ICO can be viewed as an initial public offering (IPO) that uses crypto assets.
CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY14
6.2 Crypto Assets Taxonomy 
No internationally agreed taxonomy exists for crypto assets and as a result, crypto asset types have been 
categorised into various forms, such as1920:
1. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)  – A unique digital asset that represents ownership of a specific item or 
asset e.g. art, music, in-game items, videos, and more. They are bought and sold online, frequently 
with crypto assets, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many crypto 
assets21. 
2. Security tokens  - Although the definition of a security token varies across jurisdictions, these are tokens 
that provide the holder with rights like that of traditional security, for example, the right to a share in the 
profits of the issuer. Securities tokens are often subject to securities laws and regulations.
3. Utility tokens  - These tokens provide the token holder with access to an existing or prospective product 
or service. These are usually limited to a single network (that is, the issuer) or a closed network linked 
to the issuer. For example, a tokenized store card or certain gaming tokens might be considered types 
of utility tokens.
4. Unbacked crypto assets  - These crypto assets are transferable, primarily designed to be used as a 
medium of exchange, and are often decentralised. Unbacked crypto assets are the oldest and most 
prominent type of crypto asset. They do not rely on any backing asset for value but instead on supply 
and demand. Most unbacked crypto assets are currently used for speculation and not for payment 
purposes. Prominent examples include Bitcoin and Ether (although in some jurisdictions with broad 
definitions of securities, these might be considered security tokens).
5. Stablecoins  - This type of crypto asset aims to have a stable price value. This objective is normally 
pursued by the crypto asset being linked to a single asset or a basket of assets, for example, fiat funds, 
commodities such as gold, or other crypto assets. Prominent examples include Tether, Binance USD, 
and USD Coin. 
6. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)  - A CBDC can be defined as a form of money that is 
denominated in fiat currency (central bank money), in an electronic form, and which is a liability on 
the central bank’s balance sheet similar to cash and central bank deposits22.

The majority of Crypto Asset FSPs in South Africa provide financial services by making use of unbacked 
crypto assets (60%), followed by stablecoins (26%) such as USD Coin and Binance Coin. This is then 
followed by security tokens (7%) and NFT tokens (4%).
Unbacked crypto assets are the oldest and most widely recognized digital assets. They derive their value 
solely from supply and demand dynamics, without any physical or underlying asset to support them. 
The assets offer limited or no rights to token holders and are often issued through decentralized means. 
Unbacked crypto assets are primarily utilised for speculative purposes rather than serving as a means of 
exchange25. Notable examples of unbacked crypto assets include Bitcoin and Ether. Stablecoins on the 
other hand, aim to have stable price value by being linked to a single asset or basket of assets such as fiat 
currency, commodities, or other crypto assets.  
24 While 56 submissions were made, some of the responses were received from licensed FSPs as a way of confirming 
that they do not perform any activities that constitute financial services in respect of crypto assets.

7.1.2 Head Office Location
Cape Town leads the way in head office location with the largest percentage of Crypto Asset FSPs having 
established their head offices in the city. It is followed by Johannesburg (33%) and Pretoria (7%). The 
results bear testimony to the fact that Cape Town is considered the largest technology hub in Africa and 
has been dubbed the Silicon Valley of Africa, home to more than 450 tech start-ups26. A small proportion 
of Crypto Asset FSPs operating in South Africa have their head offices in foreign countries. 
26 BusinessTech. South Africa’s ‘silicon valley’ has over 450 tech firms and employs more than 40,000 people.

CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY18
Figure 4: Head Office Location
The strong local presence bodes well for regulatory and supervisory protection. For the 10% of entities that 
have an off-shore head-office, consideration will need to be given to the requirements relating to having 
a local branch27. This is important because it, amongst other things, creates a physical presence that would 
allow the FSCA to have appropriate oversight over and ensure accountability of the institution conducting 
activities in South Africa.
7.1.3 Summary of Annual Total Revenue (may comprise a combination of traditional and 
crypto asset activities)
The data received showed that 38% of the Crypto Asset FSPs received revenue less than ZAR one million, 
while 46% received revenue between ZAR 1 and 50 million. About 10% of Crypto Asset FSPs derive their 
income from both regulated28 and unregulated financial services.
27 Even in the absence of a requirement of a local branch, they must register as an external company in terms of Section 
23 of the Companies Act, as they will be engaging in a course of conduct or have engaged on a course or pattern 
of activities (in this case providing financial services as defined in FAIS) within the Republic over a period of at least 
six months, such as will lead a person to reasonably conclude that this offshore company intended to continually 
engage in business within the Republic.
28 "Regulated” means regulated in terms of the FAIS Act and includes all activities that constitute financial services.

7.2 Outsourcing Arrangements
7.2.1 Outsourced Services
KYC/AML, exchange platform, custody, cyber security, information technology services, and blockchain 
monitoring services are some of the activities that are outsourced by Crypto Asset FSPs. This means that 
some of the financial services in respect of crypto assets and technical activities inherent to the provision 
of crypto assets financial services are outsourced. 
The outsourcing of the activities does not relieve Crypto Asset FSPs from their responsibilities to ensure fair 
treatment of customers. They, therefore, will have to comply with specific outsourcing requirements relating 
to the responsibilities of a Crypto Asset FSP , including requirements relating to:
•	the ability, capacity, and authorisation (as required by law) of the person to whom the functions 
have been outsourced
•	the contract that governs the outsourced arrangement
•	oversight of the outsourced activities
•	risk management controls and processes (including disaster recovery contingency plans)
•	effective access to data related to the outsourced activities.
It should also be understood by market participants that outsourcing financial services activities can only 
be done to entities that are themselves licensed and regulated under the FAIS framework. This mitigates 
the risk of regulatory arbitrage.

7.3 Business Model
7.3.1 Business Model
The observed business models29 are diverse. However, in some instances, the business models mirror 
traditional financial activities such as operating an exchange or providing advice. The only difference is that 
they use a different type of technology. These activities require consumers to trust centralised entities which 
is against the disintermediation function that crypto assets were designed for. The increasing significance of 
these alternative activities could result in them being categorised as systemic financial market infrastructures 
(FMIs). Going forward, it will be important to consider an equivalent regulatory and supervisory treatment 
for these crypto activities to their traditional counterparts, based on the “same activity, same risks, same 
rules” principle being embraced by certain international standard setting bodies30 and regulators31.
 
Figure 6: Summary of Business Models
7.3.2 Remuneration Model32
The majority of Crypto Asset FSPs charge trading fees (38%) followed by 25% who earn their revenue from 
administration fees while 20% earn revenue from advice fees.

 7.3.3 Cross Border Business Monitoring
56% of Respondents indicate that cross border monitoring is not applicable in their current operations, 
while 42% consider cross border monitoring as part of their business to promote good governance, fair 
treatment of customers, and regulatory compliance. 
Figure 8 : Cross Border Business Monitoring Activities
Box 2: Summary of Cross-border Monitoring Activities
i. Implementation of KYC process to ensure adherence to AML and Combating the Financial of Terrorism 
(CFT) requirements
ii. Implementation of background checks, risk assessment (related to customers, geographic area, 
products and services and delivery channels) and transaction monitoring

CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY23
Effective cross border monitoring mitigates and reduces the risk of money laundering and the financing of 
terrorism activities. This is essential in protecting the integrity of markets and the global financial framework.
7.4 Market Dynamics
7.4.1 Value of Crypto Assets Traded per Month in 2022
South African Crypto Asset FSPs recorded the highest monthly transaction value which was over ZAR8 
billion in November 2022. The average crypto assets traded were approximately ZAR520 million per 
month during the year. South Africa is one of the African countries with the highest number of crypto assets 
users in the region33. Monitoring changes in trading patterns may be an important conduct risk indicator; 
for example, substantial increases in trading volumes may bring additional operational risk, and unusual 
trading could signal market abuse.
Figure 9 : Monthly Crypto Assets Traded from January 2022 to December 2022
7.4.2 Distribution channels
Distribution channels are the avenues through which customers encounter a business and become part 
of the sales cycle. They allow the business to communicate directly, obtaining feedback from customers 
that in turn assists with improving its product offerings and customer experience. Crypto Asset FSPs should 
satisfy themselves that the channels used to distribute their financial products are appropriate to the nature 
and complexity of that financial product and the targeted financial customer. 
Over 94% of the Crypto Asset FSPs use digital channels34 to distribute and market their products and 
services while 6% utilise non-digital channels35.

Figure 10:  Distribution Platforms and Strategies
Some of the marketing strategies employed include building the client base through trading on peer-to-
peer exchanges and in-person meetings with clients to discuss product and services offering.
7.4.3 Risk Disclosure 
Almost all Crypto Asset FSPs claim to disclose the risks relating to crypto asset activities to their customers 
and the public. The accuracy of this claim and the quality of disclosure will need to be monitored over time.
Figure 1 1: Risk Disclosure

CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY25
The risk disclosures are made to the clients is several ways which include:
Box 3: Summary of Risk Disclosure
i. Risks are disclosed when clients are signing up.
ii. Risk disclosures are made on the website, exchange platform and in all communication with the clients.
iii. Risk disclosures are made on social media platforms, webinars, events and media interviews.
iv. Clients sign a crypto assets declaration describing the risks and that they understand the implications 
of trading with crypto assets.
7.5 Demand Side
7.5.1 Proportion of Retail Customers
The information gathered suggests that more than half of the Crypto Asset FSPs have 100% of their 
businesses built around retail customers. 

CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY26
The activities identified span both financial markets and financial services. This will be instructive for the 
development of both the COFI Bill and Financial Markets Act (FMA) revisions.
Figure 1 2: Proportion of Retail Customers
Understanding the extent of retail participation over time will be critical in assessing the consumer protection 
risk and impact of this market. Under the COFI Bill, provision is expected to be made for a targeted regulatory 
framework for retail customers. Understanding marketing and distribution strategies, as highlighted above, 
will be a particular focal point. Consistent with international developments, consideration may be given 
to prohibiting more risky products and services from being marketed to higher risk and more vulnerable 
customer groups36. 
7.5.2 Proportion of Financial Institutions
The information gathered suggests that approximately 1 2% of Crypto Asset FSPs have 100% of their 
businesses centered around financial institutions. The statistics also reflect that Crypto Asset FSPs have no 
customers which are retirement funds.

7.5.3 Definition of Dormant Account
The results suggest three main approaches to classification of dormancy, with most specifying some level 
of account inactivity:
- account is closed (10%)
- account has a zero balance (24%)
- level of account inactivity (65%)
Understanding the extent of dormant crypto asset accounts and unclaimed crypto assets is important to 
inform further development of the proposed framework for unclaimed financial assets, including dormant 
accounts37, that are currently under consideration. It will also provide insights into how Crypto Asset FSPs 
are embedding the Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) principles into their processes and business practices 
and will provide supervisory insights into the suitability of the product for those customers. 
Figure 1 4: Definition of Dormant Account
Some Crypto Asset FSPs reported that they have interventions in place to respond to dormant accounts. 
For instance, their consultants reach out to customers to understand why they (the clients) have stopped 
using their accounts; the account is suspended until the client signs a new annual mandate; or the dormant 
account automatically triggers an alert on AML/CFT tools.
37 See the Discussion Paper on ‘A Framework for Unclaimed Financial Assets in South Africa’ .

CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY28
7.6 Complaints
Crypto Asset FSPs are required to establish and maintain an internal complaints management framework, 
as the effective management of complaints is a vital component of TCF and contributes to the protection 
of financial customers. Such framework, inter alia, must provide for adequate systems for record keeping, 
monitoring, and analysis of complaints to enable Crypto Asset FSPs to identify trends and incidence of 
complaints, manage conduct risks, and effect improved outcomes and processes for customers. 
7.6.1 Sources of Complaints
The average number of customer complaints received between January 2022 to December 2022 was 
over 1 500 and were communicated via digital platforms. 
Figure 1 5 : Source of Complaints
7.6.2 Categorisation of Complaints
A large proportion of complaints were categorised as service and general support (42%), product design 
(24%) and investment performance (1 3%). The nature of complaints reflected suggests that the percentage 
of complaints relating to ‘service’ could be higher than reported suggesting that achieving good customer 
outcomes may not yet be embedded within the processes and practices of the Crypto Asset FSPs. The 
product and investment complaints may suggest that the crypto asset products are not suitable for the 
target market or may not be performing as customers were led to expect. The FSCA will need to explore 
whether customers are provided with key information on their products on a regular and ongoing basis 
and that information provided is appropriate and being understood by the target market. Complaints data 
is a valuable supervisory source of information that enables the FSCA to identify and more quickly and 
effectively respond to risks.

CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY29
Figure 16 : Categorisation of Complaints
 
As an important pillar of TCF38, the FSCA will also in future monitor complaints received through the ombud 
system to identify potential systemic conduct issues.
7.6.3 Complaints Handling Policy
The majority of crypto assets Crypto Asset FSPs have interventions in place to handle complaints. However, 
Crypto Asset FSPs will need to align the management and processing of complaints with the TCF outcomes. 
Some of these interventions are summarised in table 2 on the next page.
Table 2: Summary of Complaints Handling Interventions
38 Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) is an outcomes based regulatory and supervisory approach designed to ensure that 
regulated financial institutions deliver specific, clearly set out fairness outcomes for financial customers.

CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY30
8. Conclusion 
The FSCA aims to promote the development of an innovative, inclusive, and sustainable financial system in 
South Africa. Research undertaken in support of this objective allows the FSCA to better understand fintech 
and other related innovations currently taking place. The findings of this research contribute to the growing 
body of knowledge on financial sector innovations, both domestically and internationally. This allows us 
as the regulator, but also other affected stakeholders, the ability to better understand and explore how we 
can more proactively assess and respond to emerging risks and opportunities.
The information drawn will support the work of the FSCA, particularly in relation to the development of 
licensing, supervision, and regulatory frameworks for Crypto Asset FSPs, by highlighting consumer exposure 
to crypto assets. In line with risk-based supervision, the identified risks will support the FSCA’s regulatory 
and supervisory approaches going forward. It is envisaged that this will assist the authority in making more 
informed decisions regarding the potential future regulation of crypto assets-related activities.

currency, or fiat 
currency-backed 
financial contractsi) Traditional FMIs
ii) Traditional financial
institutions, broker-dealers,
custodians
iii) Unregulated entities, such as
an unregulated centralised
trading platform
iv) DeFi protocols(1) Market risks: excessive volatility,
rapid price swings can hamper the use
of crypto assets in transactions, 
particularly in settlement operations.
Sharp depreciation may generate
outflows and jeopardise the use of
certain crypto assets.
(2) Counterparty credit risks:
Depending on the mismatch of
exposures of the two payment legs.
(3) Operational risks, in particular for
unregulated entities whose records 
may be less reliable including cyber 
security risks, and legal risks where 
uncertainties of the legal status of 
crypto-assets and their broader 
ecosystem could expose entities 
different forms of legal risks.
Misconduct by any service provider of
the crypto-asset ecosystem, in
particular, in unregulated centralised
trading platforms;
(4) Reputational risks, in particular for
traditional FMIs that promote or enable
the use of crypto-assets in payment
transactions, which could face
reputational risks in the event of
payment failure.
(5) Exchange rate risk. Using for
payments or clearing, crypto assets
could substitute local currency,
especially in Emerging markets and
developing economies (EMDEs) and
non-reserve currency nations. This can
generate volatility and changes in the
level of the exchange rate.
Others:
Conflicts of interest associated with
exchanges. The use of crypto assets 
may compete with fiat currency in 
EMDES and amplify volatility to non-
reserve currencies and currencies of 
EMDEs. The above-mentioned risks 
could be amplified in the case of FIs

entities)
ii) Centralised crypto asset trading

iii) DeFi protocols
Other entities providing support
services, such as custodian,

can also, be any of the three 
above categories.(1) Credit risk: leverage magnifies 
potential losses and financial 
stability consequences of losses 
(e.g., liquidity impact of unwinding 
collateralized positions in response 
to price moves).
(2) Counterparty credit risk:
Collateralisation exposes the 
lender to the value of crypto assets. 
Collateral value and borrower 
solvency are likely to be
correlated.
(3) Others: Risk contagion as losses 
and liquidity stresses spill over to the 
core part of the financial system.
Consumer protection when 
engaging retail investors
Crypto assets allow for repeated 
rehypothecation and leverage, 
creating the possibility of very sharp 
declines and automated unwinding 
and liquidation.

also be any of the three above
categories.(1) Liquidity risks,
(2) Credit and counterparty credit
risk: the risk that the counterparty 
will fail to meet its obligations in 
accordance with agreed terms. This 
risk is particularly relevant in lending 
operations between users involving 
crypto-assets: as such, high level 
of volatility of crypto-assets may 
amplify this source of risk
(3) Market risk related to investing
assets with proceeds from 
depositors/investors
(4) Operational risks fraud, failed
process or infrastructure failure.
(5) Others: Market integrity 
related to inadequate disclosure, 
misconduct in sales and promotions.
Consumer protection when 
engaging retail investors. Risks may 
mutually reinforce and give rise to 
the rapid transmission of stress due
to tight interconnections.
Use of crypto-assets in traditional
financial activities may create new 
risks, such as elevated volatility, 
technical risks, and sudden price 
dislocations ("flash crashes") and 
increases the potential for stress in 
crypto-asset system to spill over to 
the traditional financial system.1. IOSCO, Report on Issues, Risks and

i) Traditional insurers
ii) Centralised platforms
iii) DeFi protocols (very rare in 
practice due to difficulty in pricing
the risk)(1) Credit risk, market risk, liquidity
risks in relation to accepted/

(2) Operational risks for insurers in
relation to (i) holding of own assets
(custody of keys etc.), (ii) transfers of
crypto assets, (iii) conversions in fiat 
money, and (iv) compliance with
AML/KYC regulationsIAIS: No specific standards and no 
specific guidance on insurance based 
on crypto assets exist. However, 
general standards apply, e.g., on risk 
management and internal controls 
(ICP 8), valuation of assets and 
liabilities (ICP 1 4), and investments 
(ICP 1 5) whereby the supervisor 
requires the insurer to invest only in
assets where it can properly assess 
and manage the risks. Function 4: Investment, lending, insurance, leverage and risk management

In addition, given the indirect 
exposure to crypto assets it 
provides, traditional financial 
system participants who may have 
concerns with operational resilience 
of direct holding of crypto assets 
are incentivised to hold synthetic 
exposure to crypto assets, which 
would increase interconnectedness

The nature of complaints reflected suggests that the percentage of complaints relating to ‘service’ could be higher than 
reported suggesting that achieving good customer outcomes may not yet be embedded within the processes and practices 
of the Crypto Asset FSPs. The product and investment complaints may suggest that the crypto asset products are not suitable 
for the target market or may not be performing as customers were led to expect. The FSCA will need to explore whether 
customers are provided with key information on their products on a regular and ongoing basis and that information provided 
is appropriate and being understood by the target market. Complaints data is a valuable supervisory source of information 
that enables the FSCA to identify and more quickly and effectively respond to risks.
CRYPTO ASSETS MARKET STUDY41
Some of the risks reported by the Crypto Asset FSPs are shown in Annexure 2.
Summary of common risks identified:
i. Regulatory risk : Governments around the world are still figuring out how to regulate the crypto asset industry. This 
uncertainty creates regulatory risk for investors, as new laws and regulations could significantly impact the value of their 
investments.
ii. Volatility risk : Crypto assets are highly volatile, which means their value can change rapidly and unpredictably. This 
volatility can lead to significant gains or losses for investors, making it a risky investment. Market risk: The crypto asset 
market is relatively new and has been unregulated, which makes it vulnerable to manipulation, fraud, and other market 
risks.
iii. Operational risk : Crypto assets are stored in digital wallets, which are vulnerable to hacking and theft. If a wallet is 
compromised, investors could lose their entire investment.
iv. Liquidity risk : Crypto assets can be difficult to sell quickly, especially during periods of high volatility or market stress. This 
lack of liquidity can create significant losses for investors who need to sell their assets quickly.
v. Cybersecurity risk : Crypto assets and the underlying blockchain technology are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and hacking 
attempts, which can lead to the loss of funds or personal information.
vi. Adoption risk : The widespread adoption of crypto assets by businesses and consumers is not yet assured, and failure to 
achieve widespread adoption could negatively impact the value of crypto assets.
vii. AML and KYC risk : Crypto assets can be used to facilitate illegal activities, such as money laundering and terrorist 
financing. To combat these risks, AML and KYC regulations require crypto exchanges and other virtual asset service 
providers (VASPs) to verify the identity of their customers and monitor their transactions for suspicious activity.
viii. Terrorist Financing risk : Crypto assets can be used by terrorist groups to finance their activities anonymously. This risk is 
mitigated by AML and KYC regulations, which help identify suspicious transactions and prevent the use of crypto assets 
for illicit purposes.
ix. Fraud risk : Crypto assets are vulnerable to fraud, such as Ponzi schemes, phishing scams, and fake ICOs. Investors can 
fall victim to these scams, losing their investments in the process.Annexure 2
