1. Introduction 

Despite their strong positive average returns across numerous asset classes, momentum 
strategies can experience infrequent and persistent strings of negative returns. These mo- 
mentum crashes are partly forecastable. They occur in panic states, following market de- 
clines and when market volatility is high, and are contemporaneous with market rebounds. 
The low ex ante expected returns in panic states are consistent with a conditionally high 
premium attached to the option like payoffs of past losers. An implementable dynamic 
momentum strategy based on forecasts of momentum’s mean and variance approximately 
doubles the alpha and Sharpe ratio of a static momentum strategy and is not explained 
by other factors. These results are robust across multiple time periods, international equity 
markets, and other asset classes.

A  momentum  strategy  is  a  bet  on  past  returns  pre- 
dicting  the  cross  section  of  future  returns,  typically  im- 
plemented by buying past winners and selling past losers. 
Momentum is pervasive: the academic literature shows the 
eﬃcacy of momentum strategies across multiple time pe- 
riods, in many markets, and in numerous asset classes. 1

Momentum  strategies  were  ﬁrst  shown  in  US  common  stock  re- 
turns from 1965 to 1989 by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) and Asness 
(1994) , by sorting ﬁrms on the basis of three- to 12-month past re- 
turns. Subsequently, Jegadeesh and Titman (2001) show the continuing 
eﬃcacy of US equity momentum portfolios in common stock returns in 
the 1990 to 1998 period. Israel and Moskowitz (2013) show the robust- 
ness of momentum prior to and after these studies from 1927 to 1965 
and from 1990 to 2012. Evidence of momentum going back to the Vic- 
torian age from Chabot, Ghysels, and Jagannathan (2009) and for 1801 
to 2012 from Geczy and Samonov (2015) in what the authors call “the 
world’s longest backtest.” Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999) ﬁnd momen- 
tum in industry portfolios. Rouwenhorst (1998) ; 1999 ) ﬁnds momentum 

However,  the  strong  positive  average  returns  and 
Sharpe ratios of momentum strategies are punctuated with 
occasional crashes. Like the returns to the carry trade in 
currencies (e.g., Brunnermeier, Nagel, and Pedersen, 2008 ), 
momentum  returns  are  negatively  skewed,  and  the  neg- 
ative  returns  can  be  pronounced  and  persistent.  In  our 
1927–2013 US equity sample, the two worst months for a 
momentum strategy that buys the top decile of past 12- 
month winners and shorts the bottom decile of losers are 
consecutive: July and August of 1932. Over this short pe- 
riod, the past-loser decile portfolio returned 232% and the 
past-winner  decile  portfolio  had  a  gain  of  only  32%.  In 
a  more  recent  crash,  over  the  three-month  period  from 
March to May of 2009, the past-loser decile rose by 163% 
and the decile portfolio of past winners gained only 8%. 

in developed and emerging equity markets, respectively. Asness, Liew, and 
Stevens (1997) ﬁnd momentum in country indices. Okunev and White 
(2003) ﬁnd momentum in currencies; Erb and Harvey (2006) in com- 
modities and Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen (2012) in exchange traded 
futures contracts. Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) integrate this 
evidence across markets and asset classes and ﬁnd momentum in bonds 
as well.

We investigate the impact and potential predictability 
of  these  momentum  crashes,  which  appear  to  be  a  key 
and robust feature of momentum strategies. We ﬁnd that 
crashes  tend  to  occur  in  times  of  market  stress,  when 
the market  has fallen and ex ante measures of volatility 
are high, coupled with an abrupt rise in contemporaneous 
market returns. 

Our  result  is  consistent  with  that  of  Cooper,  Gutier- 
rez, and Hameed (2004) and Stivers and Sun (2010) , who 
ﬁnd, respectively, that the momentum premium falls when 
the past three-year market return has been negative and 
that the momentum premium is low when market volatil- 
ity  is  high.  Cooper,  Gutierrez,  and  Hameed  (2004)  offer 
a behavioral explanation for these facts that may also be 
consistent with momentum performing particularly poorly 
during market rebounds if those are also times when as- 
sets become more mispriced. However, we investigate an- 
other  source  for  these  crashes  by  examining  conditional 
risk measures. 

The  patterns  we  ﬁnd  are  suggestive  of  the  changing 
beta  of  the  momentum  portfolio  partly  driving  the  mo- 
mentum  crashes.  The  time  variation  in  betas  of  return- 
sorted portfolios was ﬁrst shown by Kothari and Shanken 
(1992) , who argue that, by their nature, past-return sorted 
portfolios  have  signiﬁcant  time-varying  exposure  to  sys- 
tematic  factors.  Because  momentum  strategies  are  long 
past winners and short past losers, they have positive load- 
ings on factors which have had a positive realization, and 
negative  loadings  on  factors  that  have  had  negative  re- 
alizations,  over  the  formation  period  of  the  momentum 
strategy. 

Grundy and Martin (2001) apply Kothari and Shanken’s 
insights to price momentum strategies. Intuitively, the re- 
sult is straightforward, if not often appreciated: when the 
market has fallen signiﬁcantly over the momentum forma- 
tion period (in our case from 12 months ago to one month 
ago) a good chance exists that the ﬁrms that fell in tandem 
with the market were and are high-beta ﬁrms, and those 
that performed the best were low-beta ﬁrms. Thus, follow- 
ing market declines, the momentum portfolio is likely to 
be long low-beta stocks (the past winners) and short high- 
beta  stocks  (the  past  losers).  We  verify  empirically  that 
dramatic time variation exists in the betas of momentum 
portfolios. We ﬁnd that, following major market declines, 
betas  for  the  past-loser  decile  can  rise  above  3  and  fall 
below 0.5 for past winners. Hence, when the market re- 
bounds quickly, momentum strategies crash because they 
have a conditionally large negative beta. 

Grundy  and Martin (2001) argue that  performance of 
momentum  strategies  is  dramatically  improved,  particu- 
larly  in  the  pre-World  War  II  era,  by  dynamically  hedg- 
ing  market  and  size  risk.  However,  their  hedged  portfo- 
lio  is  constructed  based  on  forward-looking  betas,  and  is 
therefore  not  an  implementable  strategy.  We  show  that 
this results in a strong bias in estimated returns and that 
a  hedging  strategy  based  on  ex  ante  betas  does  not  ex- 
hibit the performance improvement noted in Grundy and 
Martin (2001) . 

The source of the bias is a striking correlation of the 
loser-portfolio  beta  with  the  contemporaneous  return  on 
the market. Using a Henriksson and Merton (1981) speciﬁ- 

cation, we calculate up- and down-betas for the momen- 
tum  portfolios  and  show  that,  in  a  bear  market,  a  mo- 
mentum portfolio’s up-market beta is more than double its 
down-market beta ( −1 . 51 versus −0 . 70 with a t -statistic of 
the difference = 4 . 5 ). Outside of bear markets, there is no 
statistically reliable difference in betas. 

More detailed analysis reveals that most of the up- ver- 
sus  down-beta  asymmetry  in  bear  markets  is  driven  by 
the past losers. This pattern in dynamic betas of the loser 
portfolio implies that momentum strategies in bear mar- 
kets behave like written call options on the market; that 
is, when the market falls, they gain a little, but when the 
market rises, they lose much. 

Consistent  with  the  written  call  option  like  behavior 
of the momentum strategy in bear markets, we show that 
the momentum premium is correlated with the strategy’s 
time-varying  exposure  to  volatility  risk.  Using  volatility 
index (VIX) imputed variance swap returns, we ﬁnd that 
the momentum strategy payoff has a strong negative ex- 
posure to innovations in market variance in bear markets, 
but not in normal (bull) markets. However, we also show 
that  hedging  out  this  time-  varying  exposure  to  market 
variance  (by  buying  Standard  &  Poor’s  (S&P)  variance 
swaps  in  bear  markets,  for  instance)  does  not  restore 
the  proﬁtability  of  momentum  in  bear  markets.  Hence, 
time-varying  exposure  to  volatility  risk  does  not  explain 
the time variation in the momentum premium. 

Using the insights developed about the forecastability 
of momentum payoffs, and the fact that the momentum 
strategy  volatility  is  itself  predictable  and  distinct  from 
the predictability in its mean return, we design an opti- 
mal  dynamic  momentum  strategy  in  which  the  winner- 
minus-loser (WML) portfolio is levered up or down over 
time so as to maximize the unconditional Sharpe ratio of 
the portfolio. We ﬁrst show theoretically that, to maximize 
the unconditional Sharpe ratio, a dynamic strategy should 
scale the WML weight at each particular time so that the 
dynamic strategy’s conditional volatility is proportional to 
the  conditional  Sharpe  ratio  of  the  strategy.  This  insight 
comes directly from an intertemporal version of the stan- 
dard Markowitz (1952) optimization problem. Then, using 
the results from our analysis on the forecastability of both 
the momentum premium and momentum volatility, we es- 
timate these conditional moments to generate the dynamic 
weights. 

We ﬁnd that the optimal dynamic strategy signiﬁcantly 
outperforms the standard static momentum strategy, more 
than  doubling  its  Sharpe  ratio  and  delivering  signiﬁcant 
positive alpha relative to the market, Fama and French fac- 
tors, the static momentum portfolio, and conditional ver- 
sions of all of these models that allow betas to vary in the 
crash  states.  In  addition,  the  dynamic  momentum  strat- 
egy  signiﬁcantly  outperforms  constant  volatility  momen- 
tum strategies suggested in the literature (e.g., Barroso and 
Santa-Clara  (2015) ),  producing  positive  alpha  relative  to 
the constant volatility strategy and capturing the constant 
volatility strategy’s returns in spanning tests. The dynamic 
strategy not only helps smooth the volatility of momen- 
tum  portfolios,  as  does  the  constant  volatility  approach, 
but also exploits the strong forecastability of the momen- 
tum premium.

Given the paucity of momentum crashes and the perni- 
cious effects of data mining from an ever-expanding search 
across studies (and in practice) for strategies that improve 
performance, we challenge the robustness of our ﬁndings 
by replicating the results in different sample periods, four 
different  equity  markets,  and  ﬁve  distinct  asset  classes. 
Across  different time periods, markets,  and asset classes, 
we  ﬁnd  remarkably  consistent  results.  First,  the  results 
are  robust  in  every  quarter-century  subsample  in  US 
equities. Second, momentum strategies in all markets and 
asset  classes  suffer  from  crashes,  which  are  consistently 
driven by the conditional beta and option-like feature of 
losers.  The  same  option-like  behavior  of  losers  in  bear 
markets is present in Europe, Japan, and the UK and is a 
feature of index futures-, commodity-, ﬁxed income-, and 
currency-momentum  strategies.  Third,  the  same  dynamic 
momentum  strategy  applied in these  alternative markets 
and asset classes is ubiquitously successful in generating 
superior performance over the static and constant volatil- 
ity momentum strategies in each market and asset class. 
The  additional  improvement  from  dynamic  weighting  is 
large  enough  to  produce  signiﬁcant  momentum  proﬁts 
even in markets in which the static momentum strategy 
has  famously  failed  to  yield  positive  proﬁts,  e.g.,  Japan. 
Taken together, and applied across all markets and asset 
classes,  an  implementable  dynamic  momentum  strategy 
delivers an annualized Sharpe ratio of 1.19, which is four 
times  larger  than  that  of  the  static  momentum  strategy 
applied  to  US  equities  over  the  same  period  and  thus 
poses an even greater challenge for rational asset pricing 
models ( Hansen and Jagannathan, 1991 ). 

Finally,  we  consider  several  possible  explanations  for 
the option-like behavior of momentum payoffs, particularly 
for losers. For equity momentum strategies, one possibility 
is that the optionality arises because a share of common 
stock is a call option on the underlying ﬁrm’s assets when 
there is debt in the capital structure ( Merton, 1974 ). Partic- 
ularly in distressed periods when this option-like behav- 
ior is manifested, the underlying ﬁrm values among past 
losers have generally suffered severely and are, therefore 
potentially much closer to a level in which the option con- 
vexity is strong. The past winners, in contrast, would not 
have suffered the same losses and are likely still in-the- 
money. While this explanation seems to have merit for eq- 
uity momentum portfolios, this hypothesis does not seem 
applicable for index future, commodity, ﬁxed income, and 
currency momentum, which also exhibit option-like behav- 
ior. In the conclusion, we brieﬂy discuss a behaviorally mo- 
tivated possible explanation for these option-like features 
that  could  apply  to  all  asset  classes,  but  a  fuller  under- 
standing of these convex payoffs is an open area for future 
research. 

The  layout  of  the  paper  is  as  follows:  Section  2  de- 
scribes  the  data  and  portfolio  construction  and  dissects 
momentum crashes in US equities. Section 3 measures the 
conditional betas and option-like payoffs of losers and as- 
sesses to what extent these crashes are predictable based 
on these insights. Section 4 examines the performance of 
an  optimal  dynamic  strategy  based  on  our  ﬁndings  and 
whether  its  performance  can  be  explained  by  dynamic 
loadings  on  other  known  factors  or  other  momentum 

strategies  proposed  in  the  literature.  Section  5  examines 
the  robustness  of  our  ﬁndings  in  different  time  periods, 
international  equity  markets,  and  other  asset  classes. 
Section  6  concludes  by  speculating  about  the  sources  of 
the  premia  we  observe  and  discusses  areas  for  future 
research. 

2. US equity momentum 

In this section, we present the results of our analysis of 
momentum in US common stocks over the 1927–2013 time 
period. 

2.1. US equity data and momentum portfolio construction 

Our  principal  data  source  is  the  Center  for  Research 
in Security Prices (CRSP). We construct monthly and daily 
momentum decile portfolios, both of which are rebalanced 
at  the  end  of  each  month.  The  universe  starts  with  all 
ﬁrms  listed  on  NYSE,  Amex,  or  Nasdaq  as  of  the  forma- 
tion date, using only the returns of common shares (with 
CRSP sharecode of 10 or 11). We require that a ﬁrm have 
a valid share price and number of shares as of the forma- 
tion date and that there be a minimum of eight monthly 
returns over the past 11 months, skipping the most recent 
month, which is our formation period. Following conven- 
tion and CRSP availability, all prices are closing prices, and 
all returns are from close to close. 

To form the momentum portfolios, we ﬁrst rank stocks 
based on their cumulative returns from 12 months before 
to  one  month  before  the  formation  date  (i.e.,  the t − 12 
to t − 2 -month returns), where, consistent with the liter- 
ature  ( Jegadeesh  and  Titman,  1993;  Asness,  1994;  Fama 
and French, 1996 ), we use a one-month gap between the 
end of the ranking period and the start of the holding pe- 
riod to avoid the short-term reversals shown by Jegadeesh 
(1990) and Lehmann (1990) . All ﬁrms meeting the data re- 
quirements are then placed into one of ten decile portfo- 
lios based on this ranking, where portfolio 10 represents 
the winners (those with the highest past returns) and port- 
folio  1  the  losers.  The  value-weighted  (VW)  holding  pe- 
riod returns of the decile portfolios are computed, in which 
portfolio membership does not change within a month ex- 
cept in the case of delisting. 2 

The  market  return  is  the  value  weighted  index  of  all 
listed ﬁrms in CRSP and the risk free rate series is the one- 
month Treasury bill rate, both obtained from Ken French’s 
data library. 3 We convert the monthly risk-free rate series 
to a daily series by converting the risk-free rate at the be- 
ginning of each month to a daily rate and assuming that 
that daily rate is valid throughout the month.

Fig. 1.  Winners and losers, 1927–2013. Plotted are the cumulative returns to four assets: (1) the risk-free asset; (2) the Center for Research in Security 
Prices (CRSP) value-weighted index; (3) the bottom decile “past loser” portfolio and (4) the top decile “past winner” portfolio over the full sample period 
1927:01 to 2013:03. To the right of the plot we tabulate the ﬁnal dollar values for each of the four portfolios, given a $1 investment in January 1927. 

Table 1 
Momentum portfolio characteristics, 1927:01–2013:03. 

This table presents characteristics of the monthly momentum decile portfolio excess returns over the 87-year full sample period from 1927:01 through 
2013:03. The decile 1 portfolio—the loser portfolio—contains the 10% of stocks with the worst losses, and decile 10—the winner portfolio—contains the 10% 
of the stocks with the largest gains. WML is the zero-investment winner-minus-loser portfolio which is long the Decile 1 and short the Decile 10 portfolio. 
The mean excess return, standard deviation, and alpha are in percent, and annualized. SR denotes the annualized Sharpe Ratio. The α, t ( α), and β are 
estimated from a full-period regression of each decile portfolio’s excess return on the excess Center for Research in Securities Prices value-weighted index. 
For all portfolios except WML, sk (m) denotes the full-period realized skewness of the monthly log returns (not excess) to the portfolios and sk (d) denotes 
the full-period realized skewness of the daily log returns. For WML, sk is the realized skewness of log (1 + r WML + r 

f ) .

the market portfolio, the bottom decile past loser portfolio, 
and the top decile past winner portfolio. On the right side 
of the plot, we present the ﬁnal dollar values for each of 
the four portfolios, given a $1 investment in January 1927 
(and assuming no transaction costs). 

Consistent with the existing literature, a strong momen- 
tum premium emerges over the last century. The winners 
signiﬁcantly outperform the losers and by much more than 
equities have outperformed Treasuries. Table 1 presents re- 
turn  moments  for  the  momentum  decile  portfolios  over 
this period. The winner decile excess return averages 15.3% 
per year, and the loser portfolio averages - 2.5% per year. 
In contrast, the average excess market return is 7.6%. The 

Sharpe ratio of the WML portfolio is 0.71, and that of the 
market is 0.40. Over this period, the beta of the WML port- 
folio  is  negative,  −0.58,  giving  it  an  unconditional  capi- 
tal  asset  pricing  model  (CAPM)  alpha  of  22.3%  per  year 
( t -statistic  =  8.5).  Consistent  with  the  high  alpha,  an  ex 
post optimal combination of the market and WML portfo- 
lio has a Sharpe ratio more than double that of the market. 

2.3. Momentum crashes 

The momentum strategy’s average returns are large and 
highly  statistically  signiﬁcant,  but  since  1927  there  have 
been  a  number  of  long  periods  over  which  momentum

2009 and June 1932 are, respectively, the market bottoms 
following the stock market decline associated with the re- 
cent ﬁnancial crisis and with the market decline from the 
great depression. 

Zeroing in on these crash periods, Fig. 2 shows the cu- 
mulative daily returns to the same set of portfolios from 
Fig.  1 —risk-free,  market,  past  losers,  past  winners—over 
these  subsamples.  Over  both  of  these  periods,  the  loser 
portfolio strongly outperforms the winner portfolio. From 
March 8, 2009 to March 28, 2013, the losers produce more 
than twice the proﬁts of the winners, which also under- 
perform the market over this period. From June 1, 1932 to 
December 30, 1939 the losers outperform the winners by 
50%. 

Table 1 also shows that the winner portfolios are con- 
siderably more negatively skewed (monthly and daily) than 
the loser portfolios. While the winners still outperform the 
losers  over  time,  the  Sharpe  ratio  and  alpha  understate 
the signiﬁcance of these crashes. Looking at the skewness 
of the portfolios, winners become more negatively skewed 
moving to more extreme deciles. For the top winner decile 
portfolio, the monthly (daily) skewness is −0.82 ( −0.61), 
and  while  for  the  most  extreme  bottom  decile  of  losers 
the skewness is 0.09 (0.12). The WML portfolio over this 
full sample period has a monthly (daily) skewness of −4.70 
( −1.18). 

Table 2 presents the 15 worst monthly returns to the 
WML  strategy,  as  well  as  the  lagged  two-year  returns 
on  the  market  and  the  contemporaneous  monthly  mar- 
ket return. Five key points emerge from Table 2 and from 
Figs. 1 and 2 . 

1. While past winners have generally outperformed past 
losers, there are relatively long periods over which mo- 
mentum experiences severe losses or crashes. 

2. Fourteen  of  the  15  worst  momentum  returns  occur 
when the lagged two-year market return is negative. All 
occur in months in which the market rose contempora- 
neously, often in a dramatic fashion. 

3. The clustering evident in Table 2 and in the daily cumu- 
lative returns in Fig. 2 makes it clear that the crashes 
have relatively long duration. They do not occur over 
the span of minutes or days; a crash is not a Poisson 
jump. They take place slowly, over the span of multiple 
months. 

4. Similarly,  the  extreme  losses  are  clustered.  The  two 
worst months for momentum are back-to-back, in July 
and  August  of  1932,  following  a  market  decline  of 
roughly 90% from the 1929 peak. March and April of 
2009  are  the  seventh  and  fourth  worst  momentum 
months, respectively, and April and May of 1933 are the 
sixth and 12th worst. Three of the ten worst momen- 
tum monthly returns are from 2009, a three-month pe- 
riod in which the market rose dramatically and volatil- 

ity  fell.  While  it  might  not  seem  surprising  that  the 
most extreme returns occur in periods of high volatility, 
the effect is asymmetric for losses versus gains. The ex- 
treme momentum gains are not nearly as large in mag- 
nitude or as concentrated in time. 

5. Closer examination reveals that the crash performance 
is mostly attributable to the short side or the perfor- 
mance  of  losers.  For  example,  in  July  and  August  of 
1932, the market rose by 82%. Over these two months, 
the winner decile rose by 32%, but the loser decile was 
up  by  232%.  Similarly,  over  the  three-  month  period 
from March to May of 2009, the market was up by 26%, 
but the loser decile was up by 163%. Thus, to the extent 
that the strong momentum reversals we observe in the 
data can be characterized as a crash, they are a crash in 
which the short side of the portfolio—the losers—crash 
up, not down. 

Table 2 also suggests that large changes in market beta 
can  help  to  explain  some  of  the  large  negative  returns 
earned  by  momentum  strategies.  For  example,  as  of  the 
beginning  of  March  2009,  the  ﬁrms  in  the  loser  decile 
portfolio were, on average, down from their peak by 84%. 
These ﬁrms included those hit hardest by the ﬁnancial cri- 
sis: Citigroup, Bank of America, Ford, GM, and International 
Paper  (which  was  highly  levered).  In  contrast,  the  past 
winner  portfolio  was  composed  of  defensive  or  counter 
cyclical ﬁrms such as Autozone. The loser ﬁrms, in particu- 
lar, were often extremely levered and at risk of bankruptcy. 
In the sense of the Merton (1974) model, their common 
stock  was  effectively  an  out-of-the-money  option  on  the 
underlying ﬁrm value. This suggests that potentially large 
differences  exist  in  the  market  betas  of  the  winner  and 
loser portfolios that generate convex, option-like payoffs. 

3. Time-varying beta and option-like payoffs 

To  investigate  the  time-varying  betas  of  winners  and 
losers,  Fig.  3  plots  the  market  betas  for  the  winner  and 
loser momentum deciles, estimated using 126-day ( ≈ six 
month) rolling market model regressions with daily data. 4 
Fig. 3 plots the betas over three non overlapping subsam- 
ples  that  span  the  full  sample  period:  June  1927  to  De- 
cember 1939, January 1940 to December 1999, and January 
20 0 0 to March 2013. 

The  betas  vary  substantially,  especially  for  the  loser 
portfolio, whose beta tends to increase dramatically dur- 
ing volatile periods. The ﬁrst and third plots highlight the 
betas several years before, during, and after the momen- 
tum  crashes.  The  beta  of  the  winner  portfolio  is  some- 
times  above  2  following  large  market  rises,  but,  for  the

We use ten daily lags of the market return in estimating the market 

m,t + β1 ˜ r e 

m,t−10 + ˜ (cid:5)i,t

betas. We estimate a daily regression speciﬁcation of the form 
i,t = β0 ˜ r e 
˜ r e 
and then report the sum of the estimated coeﬃcients  ˆ β0 + ˆ β1 + · · · + ˆ β10 . 
Particularly for the past loser portfolios, and especially in the pre-WWII 
period, the lagged coeﬃcients are strongly signiﬁcant, suggesting that 
market wide information is incorporated into the prices of many of the 
ﬁrms in these portfolios over the span of multiple days. See Lo and 
MacKinlay (1990) and Jegadeesh and Titman (1995) .

loser portfolio, the beta reaches far higher levels (as high 
as 4 or 5). The widening beta differences between winners 
and losers, coupled with the facts from Table 2 that these 
crash  periods  are  characterized  by  sudden  and  dramatic 
market upswings, mean that the WML strategy experiences 
huge losses during these times. We examine these patterns 
more formally by investigating how the mean return of the 
momentum portfolio is linked to time variation in market 
beta. 

3.1. Hedging market risk in the momentum portfolio 

Grundy and Martin (2001) explore this same question, 
arguing that the poor performance of the momentum port- 
folio in the pre-WWII period ﬁrst shown by Jegadeesh and 
Titman (1993) is a result of time-varying market and size 
exposure. They argue that a hedged momentum portfolio, 
for  which  conditional  market  and  size  exposure  is  zero, 
has a high average return and a high Sharpe ratio in the 
pre-WWII period when the unhedged momentum portfo- 
lio suffers. 

At  the  time  that  Grundy  and  Martin  (2001)  under- 
took their study, daily stock return data were not available 
through CRSP in the pre-1962 period. Given the dynamic 
nature of momentum’s risk exposures, estimating the fu- 
ture hedge coeﬃcients ex ante with monthly data is prob- 
lematic. As a result, Grundy and Martin (2001) construct 
their hedge portfolio based on a regression with monthly 
returns over the current month and the future ﬁve months. 
That  is,  the  hedge  portfolio  was  not  an  ex-ante  imple- 
mentable portfolio. 

However,  to  the  extent  that  the  future  momentum- 
portfolio beta is correlated with the future return of the 
market, this procedure results in a biased estimate of the 
returns of the hedged portfolio. We show there is in fact 
a strong correlation of this type, which results in a large 

upward bias in the estimated performance of the hedged 
portfolio. 5 

3.2. Option-like behavior of the WML portfolio 

The source of the bias using the ex post beta of the mo- 
mentum portfolio to construct the hedge portfolio is that, 
in bear markets, the market beta of the WML portfolio is 
strongly  negatively  correlated  with  the  contemporaneous 
realized  market  return.  This  means  that  a  hedge  portfo- 
lio constructed using the ex post beta will have a higher 
beta in anticipation of a higher future market return, mak- 
ing its performance much better that what would be pos- 
sible with a hedge portfolio based on the ex ante beta. 

In this subsection, we also show that the return of the 
momentum  portfolio,  net  of  properly  estimated  (i.e.,  ex 
ante)  market  risk,  is  signiﬁcantly  lower  in  bear  markets. 
Both of these results are linked to the fact that, in bear 
markets, the momentum strategy behaves as if it is effec- 
tively short a call option on the market. 

We  ﬁrst  illustrate  these  issues  with  a  set  of  four 
monthly time series regressions, the results of which are 
presented in Table 3 . The dependent variable in all regres- 
sions is  ˜ R WML ,t , the WML return in month t . The indepen- 
dent variables are combinations of 
1.  ˜ R e 

m,t ,  the  CRSP  value-weighted  index  excess  return  in 
month t . 

2. I B,t−1 , an ex ante bear market indicator that equals one 
if the cumulative CRSP VW index return in the past 24 
months is negative and is zero otherwise; 

3. ˜ I U,t , a contemporaneous, i.e., not ex ante, up-market in- 
dicator variable that is one if the excess CRSP VW index 
return is greater than the risk-free rate in month t (e.g., 
m,t > 0 ), and is zero otherwise. 6 
R e 
Regression  1  in  Table  3  ﬁts  an  unconditional  market 

model to the WML portfolio: 
˜ R WML ,t = α0 + β0 ˜ R m,t + ˜ (cid:5)t . 
Consistent with the results in the literature, the estimated 
market  beta  is  negative,  −0.576,  and  the  intercept,  ˆ α,  is 
both economically large (1.852% per month) and statisti- 
cally signiﬁcant ( t -statistic = 7.3). 

(1) 

Regression 2 in Table 3 ﬁts a conditional CAPM with the 

bear market indicator, I B , as an instrument: 
˜ R WML ,t = (α0 + αB I B,t−1 ) + (β0 + βB I B,t−1 ) ˜ R m,t + ˜ (cid:5)t . 
This speciﬁcation is an attempt to capture both expected 
return and market-beta differences in bear markets. Con- 
sistent with Grundy and Martin (2001) , a striking change

5 

The result that the betas of winner-minus-loser portfolios are non- 
linearly related to contemporaneous market returns has also been shown 
in Rouwenhorst (1998) who ﬁnds this feature for non-US equity momen- 
tum strategies (Table V, p. 279). Chan (1988) and DeBondt and Thaler 
(1987) show this nonlinearity for longer-term winner and loser portfolios. 
However, Boguth, Carlson, Fisher, and Simutin (2011) , building on the re- 
sults of Jagannathan and Korajczyk (1986) , note that the interpretation of 
the measures of abnormal performance (i.e., the alphas) in Chan (1988) , 
Grundy and Martin (2001) , and Rouwenhorst (1998) are problematic and 
provide a critique of Grundy and Martin (2001) and other studies that 
overcondition in a similar way. 

Of the 1,035 months in the 1927:01-2013:03 period, I B,t−1 = 1 in 183, 

6 

and ˜ I U,t = 1 in 618.

Fig. 3.  Market betas of winner and loser decile portfolios. These three plots present the estimated market betas over three independent subsamples 
spanning our full sample: 1927:06 to 1939:12, 1940:01 to 1999:12, and 20 0 0:01 to 2013:03. The betas are estimated by running a set of 126-day rolling 
regressions of the momentum portfolio excess returns on the contemporaneous excess market return and ten (daily) lags of the market return and summing 
the betas. 

is evident in the market beta of the WML portfolio in bear 
markets. It is −1.131 lower, with a t -statistic of −13 . 4 on 
the difference. The WML alpha in bear market is 2.04% per 
month lower ( t -statistic = −3 . 4 ). Interestingly, the point es- 
timate for the alpha in bear markets (equal to  ˆ α0 + ˆ αB ) is 
just below zero, but not statistically signiﬁcant. 

Regression  3  introduces  an  additional  element  to  the 
regression  that  allows  us  to  assess  the  extent  to  which 
the  up-  and  down-market  betas  of  the  WML  portfolio 
differ: 

˜ R WML ,t = (α0 + αB · I B,t−1 ) 

+ (β0 + I B,t−1 (βB + ˜ I U,t βB,U )) ˜ R m,t + ˜ (cid:5)t .

This speciﬁcation is similar to that used by Henriksson and 
Merton (1981) to assess market timing ability of fund man- 
agers.  Here,  the  ˆ βB,U  of −0.815  ( t -statistic = −4 . 5 )  shows 
that  the  WML  portfolio  does  very  badly  when  the  mar- 
ket  rebounds  following  a  bear  market.  When  in  a  bear 
market, the point estimates of the WML beta are −0.742

Table 3 
Market timing regression results. 

This table presents the results of estimating four speciﬁcations of a 
monthly time-series regressions run over the period 1927:01 to 2013:03. 
In all cases the dependent variable is the return on the WML portfolio. 
The independent variables are a constant; an indicator for bear markets, 
I B,t−1 , which equals one if the cumulative past two-year return on the 
market is negative; the excess market return, R e 
m,t ; and a contempora- 
neous up-market indicator, I U, t , which equals one if R e 
m,t > 0 . The coef- 
ﬁcients ˆ α0 and ˆ αB are multiplied by 100 (i.e., are in percent per month).

negative and =  ˆ β0 + ˆ βB + ˆ βB,U = −1 . 796 when the market 
return is positive. In other words, the momentum portfolio 
is effectively short a call option on the market 

The predominant source of this optionality comes from 
the  loser  portfolio.  Panel  A  of  Table  4  presents  the  esti- 
mation  of  the  regression  speciﬁcation  in  (3)  for  each  of 
the  ten  momentum  portfolios.  The  ﬁnal  row  of  the  ta- 
ble (the  ˆ βB,U  coeﬃcient) shows the strong up-market be- 
tas for the loser portfolios in bear markets. For the loser 
decile,  the  down-market  beta  is  1.560  ( = 1 . 338 + 0 . 222 ) 
and  the  point  estimate  of  the  up-market  beta  is  2.160 
( = 1 . 560 + 0 . 600 ).  In  contrast,  the  up-market  beta  incre- 
ment for the winner decile is slightly negative ( = −0 . 215 ). 
This pattern also holds for less extreme winners and losers, 
such as Decile 2 versus Decile 9 or Decile 3 versus Decile 
8,  with  the  differences  between  winners  and  losers  de- 
clining monotonically for less extreme past return-sorted 
portfolios.  The  net  effect  is  that  a  momentum  portfolio 
which is long winners and short losers will have signiﬁ- 
cant negative market exposure following bear markets pre- 
cisely when the market swings upward and that exposure 
is even more negative for more extreme past return-sorted 
portfolios. 

3.3. Asymmetry in the optionality 

The  optionality  associated  with  the  loser  portfo- 
lios  is  signiﬁcant  only  in  bear  markets.  Panel  B  of 
Table 4 presents the same set of regressions using the bull 
market indicator I L,t−1  instead of the bear-market indica- 
tor I B,t−1 . The key variables here are the estimated coef- 
ﬁcients and t -statistics on β L, U , presented in the last two 
rows of  Panel B. Unlike in Panel A,  no signiﬁcant asym- 
metry is present in the loser portfolio, though the winner 
portfolio asymmetry is comparable to Panel A. The net ef- 
fect is that the WML portfolio shows no statistically signif- 
icant optionality in bull markets, unlike in bear markets. 

3.4. Ex ante versus ex post hedge of market risk for WML 

The results of the preceding analysis suggest that cal- 
culating hedge ratios based on future realized betas, as in 
Grundy  and  Martin  (2001) ,  is  likely  to  produce  strongly 
upward biased estimates of the performance of the hedged 
portfolio. This is because the realized market beta of the 
momentum portfolio is more negative when the realized 
return  of  the  market  is  positive.  Thus,  hedging  ex  post, 
when the hedge is based on the future realized portfolio 
beta, takes more market exposure (as a hedge) when the 
future market return is high, leading to a strong upward 
bias in the estimated performance of the hedged portfolio. 
As an illustration of the magnitude of the bias, Fig. 4 
plots the cumulative log return to the unhedged, ex post 
hedged, and ex ante hedged WML momentum portfolio. 7 
The ex post hedged portfolio takes the WML portfolio and 
hedges out market risk using an ex post estimate of mar- 
ket  beta.  Following  Grundy  and  Martin  (2001) ,  we  con- 
struct the ex post hedged portfolio based on WML’s future 
42-day (two-month) realized market beta, estimated using 
daily  data.  Again,  to  calculate  the  beta  we  use  ten  daily 
lags of the market return. The ex ante hedged portfolio es- 
timates market betas using the lagged 42 days of returns 
of the portfolio on the market, including ten daily lags. 

Panel A of Fig. 4 plots the cumulative log returns to all 
three momentum portfolios over the June 1927 to Decem- 
ber 1939 period, covering a few years before, during, and 
after  the  biggest  momentum  crash.  The  ex  post  hedged 
portfolio exhibits considerably improved performance over 
the unhedged momentum portfolio as it is able to avoid 
the  crash.  However,  the  ex  ante  hedged  portfolio  is  not 
only unable to avoid or mitigate the crash, but also under- 
performs the unhedged portfolio over this period. Hence, 
trying  to  hedge ex  ante,  as  an  investor  would  in  reality, 
would have made an investor worse off. The bias in using 
ex post betas is substantial over this period. 

Panel  B  of  Fig.  4  plots  the  cumulative  log  returns  of 
the three momentum portfolios over the full sample pe- 
riod  from  1927:01  to  2013:03.  Again,  the  strong  bias  in 
the ex post hedge is clear, as the ex ante hedged portfo- 
lio performs no better than the unhedged WML portfolio 
in the overall period and signiﬁcantly worse than the ex 
post hedged portfolio. 

3.5. Market stress and momentum returns 

A  casual  interpretation  of  the  results  presented  in 
Section 3.2 is that, in a bear market, the portfolio of past 
losers behaves like a call option on the market and that 
the value of this option is not adequately reﬂected in the 
prices of these assets. This leads to a high expected return 
on the losers in bear markets, and a low expected return 
to the WML portfolio that shorts these past losers. Because 
the value of an option on the market is increasing in the 
market  variance,  this  interpretation  further  suggests  that 
the expected return of the WML portfolio should be a de- 
creasing function of the future variance of the market.

Table 4 
Momentum portfolio optionality. 

This table presents estimated coeﬃcients (t-statistics) from regressions of the monthly excess returns of the momentum decile portfolios and the winner- 
minus-loser (WML) long-short portfolio on the Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) value-weighted (VW) excess market returns, and a number 
of indicator variables. Panel A reports results for optionality in bear markets in which, for each of the momentum portfolios, the following regression is 
estimated: 

˜ R e 
i,t = [ α0 + αB I B,t−1 ] + [ β0 + I B,t−1 (βB + ˜ I U,t βB,U )] ˜ R e 
where R e 
m is the CRSP VW excess market return, I B,t−1 is an ex ante bear market indicator that equals one if the cumulative CRSP VW index return in the 
past 24 months is negative and is zero otherwise. I U, t is a contemporaneous up-market indicator that equals one if the excess CRSP VW index return is 
positive in month t , and is zero otherwise. Panel B reports results for optionality in bull markets where for each of the momentum portfolios, the following 
regression is estimated: 

m,t + ˜ (cid:5)t , 

˜ R e 
i,t = [ α0 + αL I L,t−1 ] + [ β0 + I L,t−1 (βL + ˜ I U,t βL,U )] ˜ R m,t + ˜ (cid:5)t 

where I L,t−1 is an ex ante bull market indicator (deﬁned as 1 − I B,t−1 ). The sample period is 1927:01-2013:03. The coeﬃcients ˆ α0 , ˆ αB and ˆ αL are multiplied 
by 100 (i.e., are in percent per month).

To examine this hypothesis, we use daily market return 
data to construct an ex ante estimate of the market volatil- 
ity over the coming month, and we use this market vari- 
ance estimate in combination with the bear market indi- 
cator, I 
B, t-1 , to forecast future WML returns. We run the 
regression

Table  5  reports  the  regression  results,  showing  that 
both  estimated  market  variance  and  the  bear  market 
indicator  independently  forecast  future  momentum  re- 
turns.  Columns  1  and  2  report  regression  results  for 
each variable separately, and column 3 reports results us- 
ing  both  variables  simultaneously.  The  results  are  con- 
sistent  with  those  from  Section  3.4 .  That  is,  in  peri- 
ods  of  high  market  stress,  as  indicated  by  bear  mar- 
kets  and  high  volatility,  future  momentum  returns  are 
low.  Finally,  the  last  two  columns  of  Table  5  report  re- 

sults for the interaction between the bear market indica- 
tor and volatility, in which momentum returns are shown 
to  be  particularly  poor  during  bear  markets  with  high 
volatility. 

3.6. Exposure to other risk factors 

Our  results  show  that  time-varying  exposure  to  mar- 
ket  risk  cannot  explain  the  low  returns  of  the  momen- 
tum portfolio in crash states. However, the option-like be- 
havior  of  the  momentum  portfolio  raises  the  intriguing 
question of whether the premium associated with momen- 
tum could be related to exposure to variance risk because, 
in panic states, a long-short momentum portfolio behaves 
like  a  short  (written)  call  option  on  the  market  and  be- 
cause  shorting  options  (i.e.,  selling  variance)  has  histori- 
cally earned a large premium ( Carr and Wu, 2009; Chris- 
tensen and Prabhala, 1998 ). 

To  assess  the  dynamic  exposure  of  the  momentum 
strategy to variance innovations, we regress daily WML re- 
turns on the inferred daily (excess) returns of a variance 
swap on the S&P 500, which we calculate using the VIX 
and S&P 500 returns. Section A.2 of Appendix A provides

in the corresponding coeﬃcient during a bear market, in 
which the weight on each observation is proportional to 
the ex ante market variance leading up to that month. 

Table 6 presents the results of this analysis. In regres- 
sion 1 the intercept ( α) estimates the mean return of the 
WML portfolio when I B,t−1 = 0 as 31.48% per year. How- 
ever,  the  coeﬃcient  on  I 
Bσ 2  shows  that  the  weighted- 
average return in panic periods (volatile bear markets) is 
almost 59% per year lower 

Regression 2 controls for the market return and condi- 
tional market risk. Consistent with our earlier results, the 
last  coeﬃcient  in  this  column  shows  that  the  estimated 
WML beta falls by 0.518 ( t -statistic = −28 . 4 ) in panic states. 

However, both the mean WML return in calm periods and 
the  change  in  the  WML  premium  in  the  panic  periods 
(given, respectively, by α and the coeﬃcient on I 
Bσ 2 ), re- 
main about the same. 

In regression 3, we add the return on the variance swap 
Bσ 2 . The coeﬃcient on ˜ r v s,t shows 
and its interaction with I 
that outside of panic states (i.e., when I B,t−1 = 0 ), the WML 
return  does  not  co-vary  signiﬁcantly  with  the  variance 
Bσ 2 · ˜ r v s,t  shows 
swap return. However, the coeﬃcient on I 
that in panic states, WML has a strongly signiﬁcant nega- 
tive loading on the variance swap return. That is, WML is 
effectively short volatility during these periods. This is con- 
sistent with our previous results, in which WML behaves 
like a short call option, but only in panic periods. Outside 
of these periods, there is no evidence of any optionality. 

However, the intercept and estimated I 

Bσ 2 coeﬃcient in 
regression 3 are essentially unchanged, even after control- 
ling for the variance swap return. The estimated WML pre- 
mium in non-panic states remains large, and the change in 
this premium in panic states (i.e., the coeﬃcient on I 
Bσ 2 ) 
is just as negative as before, indicating that although mo- 
mentum  returns  are  related  to  variance  risk,  neither  the 
unconditional  nor  the  conditional  returns  to  momentum 
are explained by it. 

We also regress the WML momentum portfolio returns 
on the three Fama and French (1993) factors consisting of 
the CRSP VW index return in excess of the risk-free rate, a 
small minus big (SMB) stock factor, and a high book eq- 
uity  to  market  equity  (BE/ME)  minus  low  BE/ME  (HML) 
factor, all obtained from Ken French’s website. In addition, 
we interact each of the factors with the panic state vari- 
Bσ 2 . The results are reported in Appendix B , in which 
able I 
the abnormal performance of momentum continues to be 
signiﬁcantly more negative in bear market states, whether 
we  measure  abnormal  performance  relative  to  the  mar- 
ket model or to the Fama and French (1993) three-factor 
model, with little difference in the point estimates. 8 

4. Dynamic weighting of the momentum portfolio 

Using the insights from Section 3 , we evaluate the per- 
formance of a strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight 
on the WML momentum strategy using the forecasted re- 
turn and variance of the strategy. We show that the dy- 
namic strategy generates a Sharpe ratio more than double 
that of the baseline $1 long/$1 short WML strategy and is 
not explained by other factors or other suggested dynamic 
momentum portfolios such as a constant volatility momen- 
tum  strategy  ( Barroso  and  Santa-Clara,  2015 ).  Moreover, 
we  employ  an  out-of-sample  dynamic  momentum  strat- 
egy that is implementable in real time and show that this 
portfolio performs about as well as an in-sample version 

8 

Although beyond the scope of this paper, we also examine HML and 
SMB as the dependent variable in similar regressions. We ﬁnd that HML 
has opposite signed market exposure in panic states relative to WML, 
which is not surprising because value strategies buy long-term losers and 
sell winners, the opposite of what a momentum strategy does. The corre- 
lation between WML and HML is −0 . 50 . However, an equal combination 
of HML and WML does not completely hedge the panic state optionality 
as the effects on WML are quantitatively stronger. The details are pro- 
vided in Appendix B .

whose parameters are estimated more precisely over the 
full sample period. 

We begin with the design of the dynamic strategy. We 
show  in  Appendix  C  that,  for  the  objective  function  of 
maximizing the in-sample unconditional Sharpe ratio, the 
optimal weight on the risky asset (WML) at time t −1 is

t−1 ≡ E t−1 [(R 2 

where μt−1 ≡ E t−1 [ R WML ,t ] is the conditional expected re- 
turn  on  the  (zero-investment)  WML  portfolio  over  the 
coming month, σ 2 
WML ,t − μt−1 ) 2 ] is the condi- 
tional variance of the WML portfolio return over the com- 
ing month, and λ is a time-invariant scalar that controls 
the unconditional risk and return of the dynamic portfolio. 
This optimal weighting scheme comes from an intertem- 
poral version of Markowitz (1952) portfolio optimization. 

We then use the insights from our previous analysis to 
provide an estimate of μt−1 , the conditional mean return 
of WML. The results from Table 5 provide an instrument 
for  the  time  t  conditional  expected  return  on  the  WML 
portfolio. As a proxy for the expected return, we use the 
ﬁtted regression of the WML returns on the interaction be- 
tween the bear market indicator I B,t−1 and the market vari- 
ance over the preceding six months (i.e., the regression es- 
timated in the fourth column of Table 5 ). 

To forecast the volatility of the WML series, we ﬁrst ﬁt 
a the generalized autoregressive conditional heterostedas- 
ticity  (GARCH)  model  proposed  by  Glosten,  Jagannathan, 
and Runkle (1993) —the GJR-GARCH model—to the WML re- 
turn series. The process is deﬁned by

We form a linear combination of the forecast of future 
volatility from the ﬁtted GJR-GARCH process with the re- 
alized standard deviation of the 126 daily returns preced- 
ing the current month. We show in Appendix D that both 
components contribute to forecasting future daily realized 
WML volatility. 

Our analysis in this section is also related to work by 
Barroso and Santa-Clara (2015) , who argue that momen- 
tum  crashes  can  be  avoided  with  a  momentum  portfo- 
lio  that  is  scaled  by  its  trailing  volatility.  They  further 
show that the unconditional Sharpe ratio of the constant- 
volatility momentum strategy is far better than a simple 
$1-long/$1-short strategy. 

9 

Engle and Ng (1993) investigate the performance of a number of para- 
metric models in explaining daily market volatility for Japan. They ﬁnd 
that the GJR model that we use here best ﬁts the dynamic structure of 
volatility for that market. 

Eq. (6) shows that our results would be approximately 
the same as those of Barroso and Santa-Clara (2015) if the 
Sharpe ratio of the momentum strategy were time invari- 
ant, i.e., if the forecast mean were always proportional to 
the forecast volatility. Eq. (6) shows that, in this setting, 
the  weight  on  WML  would  be  inversely  proportional  to 
the forecast WML volatility – that is the optimal dynamic 
strategy would be a constant volatility strategy like the one 
proposed by Barroso and Santa-Clara (2015) . 

However, this is not the case for momentum. In fact, 
the  return  of  WML  is  negatively  related  to  the  forecast 
WML  return  volatility,  related  in  part  to  our  ﬁndings  of 
lower  momentum  returns  following  periods  of  market 
stress.  This  means  that  the  Sharpe  ratio  of  the  optimal 
dynamic  portfolio  varies  over  time  and  is  lowest  when 
WML’s volatility is forecast to be high (and its mean re- 
turn low). To test this hypothesis, in Section 4.1 we imple- 
ment a dynamic momentum portfolio using these insights 
and  show  that  the  dynamic  strategy  outperforms  a  con- 
stant volatility strategy. 

To better illustrate this, Fig. 5 plots the weight on the 
($1-long/$1-short) WML portfolio for the three strategies: 
the baseline WML strategy, the constant-volatility strategy 
(cvol), and the dynamic strategy (dyn) with a WML weight 
given by Eq. (6) . Here, we scale the weights of both the 
constant volatility and the dynamic strategy so as to make 
the full sample volatility of each return series equal to that 
of the baseline WML strategy. Also, in the legend we indi- 
cate the average weight on WML for each strategy and the 
time series standard deviation of the WML weight by strat- 
egy. 

By deﬁnition, the baseline dollar long-dollar short WML 
strategy has a constant weight of 1. In contrast, the con- 
stant volatility strategy WML-weight varies more, reaching 
a  maximum  of  2.18  in  November  1952  and  a  minimum 
of  0.53  in  June  2009.  The  full  dynamic  strategy  weights 
are  3.6  times  more  volatile  than  the  constant  volatility 
weights, reaching a maximum of 5.37 (also in November 
1952) and a minimum of -0.604 in March 1938. Unlike the 
constant volatility strategy, for which the weight cannot go 
below zero, the dynamic strategy weight is negative in 82 
of the months in our sample, necessarily in months when 
the forecast return of the WML strategy is negative. 

This result indicates that the dynamic strategy, at times, 
employs  considerably  more  leverage  than  the  constant 
volatility strategy. In addition, an actual implementation of 
the dynamic strategy would certainly incur higher trans- 
action  costs  than  the  other  two  strategies.  These  factors 
should certainly be taken into account in assessing practi- 
cal implications of the strong performance of the strategy. 

4.1. Dynamic strategy performance 

Panel  A  of  Fig.  6  plots  the  cumulative  returns  to  the 
dynamic strategy from July 1927 to March 2013, in which 
λ is  chosen  so  that  the  in-sample  annualized  volatility 
of  the  strategy  is  19%,  the  same  as  that  of  the  CRSP 
value-weighted  index  over  the  full  sample.  For  compari- 
son, we also plot the cumulative log returns of the static 
WML  strategy  and  the  constant  volatility  strategy,  both 
also scaled to 19% annual volatility. As Fig. 6 shows, the

Fig. 5.  Dynamic strategy weights on winner-minus-loser (WML) portfolio. We plot the weight on the WML portfolio as a function of time for in static WML 
portfolio, the constant volatility strategy (cvol), and the dynmaic strategy (dyn). The ﬁgure legend reports the time series mean and standard deviation for 
the WML weight for each portfolio. 

dynamic portfolio outperforms the constant volatility port- 
folio, which, in turn, outperforms the basic WML portfolio. 
The Sharpe ratio (in parentheses on the ﬁgure legend) of 
the  dynamic  portfolio  is  nearly  twice  that  of  the  static 
WML portfolio and a bit higher than the constant volatility 
momentum  portfolio.  In  section  4.4 ,  we  conduct  formal 
spanning tests among these portfolios as well as other fac- 
tors. Consistent with our previous results, part of the out- 
performance of the dynamic strategy comes from its ability 
to  mitigate  momentum  crashes.  However,  the  dynamic 
strategy outperforms the other momentum strategies even 
outside of the 1930s and the ﬁnancial crisis period. 

4.2. Subsample performance 

As a check on the robustness of our results, we perform 
the  same  analysis  over  a  set  of  approximately  quarter- 
century subsamples: 1927 to 1949, 1950 to 1974, 1975 to 
1999, and 20 0 0 to 2013. We use the same mean and vari- 
ance forecasting equation and the same calibration in each 
of the four subsamples. Panels B–E of Fig. 6 plot the cu- 
mulative log returns by subsample and present the strat- 
egy Sharpe ratios (in parentheses) by subsample. For ease 
of comparison, returns for each of the strategies are scaled 
to an annualized volatility of 19% in each subsample. 

In each of the four subsamples,the ordering of perfor- 
mance  remains  the  same.  The  dynamic  strategy  outper- 

forms the constant volatility strategy, which outperforms 
the static WML strategy. As the subsample plots show, part 
of the improved performance of the constant volatility, and 
especially dynamic strategy, over the static WML portfolio 
is the amelioration of big crashes. But, even over subperi- 
ods devoid of those crashes, there is still improvement. 

4.3. Out-of-sample performance 

One  important  potential  concern  with  the  dynamic 
strategy  performance  results  presented  above  is  that  the 
trading  strategy  relies  on  parameters  estimated  over  the 
full sample. This is a particular concern here, as our dy- 
namic  strategy  relies  on  the  conditional  expected  WML- 
return estimate from the ﬁtted regression in column 4 of 
Table 5 . 

To shed some light on whether the dynamic strategy re- 
turns could have been achieved by an actual investor who 
would not have known these parameters, we construct an 
out-of-sample strategy. We continue to use Eq. (6) to de- 
termine the weight on the WML portfolio, and we continue 
to  use  the  ﬁtted  regression  speciﬁcation  in  Column  4  of 
Table 5 for the forecast mean, that is, 
μt−1 ≡ E t−1 [ ˜ R WML ,t ] = ˆ γ0 ,t−1 + ˆ γint ,t −1 · I B , t −1 · ˆ σ 2 
only now the  ˆ γ0 ,t−1  and  ˆ γ
int ,t −1  in our forecasting speci- 
ﬁcation are the estimated regression coeﬃcients not over 

m,t−1 ,  (9)

Fig. 6.  Dynamic momentum strategy performance. These plots show the cumulative returns to the dynamic strategy, (dyn), from Eqn. (6) , in which λ
is chosen so that the in-sample annualized volatility of the strategy is 19%, the same as that of the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) value- 
weighted index over the full sample. For comparison, we also plot the cumulative log returns of the static winner-minus-lower (WML) strategy and a 
constant volatility strategy (cvol), similar to that of Barroso and Santa-Clara (2015) , also scaled to an annualized volatility of 19%. Panel A plots the cumu- 
lative returns over the full sample period from 1927:07 to 2013:03. Panels B–E plot the returns over four roughly quarter-century subsamples: 1927–1949, 
1950–1974, 1975–1999, and 20 0 0–2013. The annualized Sharpe ratios of each strategy in each period are reported in parentheses in the corresponding

the full sample, but rather from a regression run from the 
start of our sample (1927:07) up through month t −1 . 10 To 
estimate the month t WML variance we use the 126-day 
WML  variance  estimated  through  the  last  day  of  month 
t −1 . 

Fig. 7 plots the coeﬃcients for this expanding window 
regression as a function of the date. The slope coeﬃcient 
begins only in October 1930, because the bear market in- 
dicator ( I B ) is zero up until October 1930. 11 From January 
1933 until the end of our sample, the slope coeﬃcient is 
always in the range of −0.43 to −0.21.The slope coeﬃcient 
rises dramatically just before the poor performance of the 
momentum strategy in the 2001 and 2009 periods. These 
were bear markets (i.e., I B = 1 ) in which the market con- 
tinued  to  fall  and  momentum  performed  well.  However, 
in each of these cases the forecasting variable eventually 
works in the sense that momentum does experience very 
bad performance and the slope coeﬃcient falls. Following 
the fairly extreme 2009 momentum crash, the slope coef- 
ﬁcient falls below −0.40 in August and September 2009. 

4.3.1. Out-of-sample strategy performance 

Table  7  presents  a  comparison  of  the  performance  of 
the  various  momentum  strategies:  the  $1  long–$1  short 
static  WML  strategy,  the  constant  volatility  strategy,  and 
strategy scaled by variance instead of standard deviation, 

10 
We have added t − 1 subscripts to these coeﬃcients to emphasize the 
fact that they are in the investor’s information set at the end of month 
t − 1 . 
11 
Also, the intercept up to October 1930 is simply the mean monthly 
return on the momentum portfolio up to that time. After October 1930, it 
is the intercept coeﬃcient for the regression. 

Table 7 
Strategy performance comparison. 

This table presents the annualized Sharpe ratios of ﬁve zero-investment 
portfolio strategies, based on the monthly returns of these strategies over 
the 1934:01–2013:03 time period. WML is the baseline winner-minus- 
loser momentum strategy. cvol is the constant volatility strategy, in which 
the WML returns each month are scaled by the realized volatility of the 
daily WML returns over the preceding 126 trading days. For the variance 
scaled portfolio, the WML returns each month are scaled by the realized 
variance of the daily WML returns over the preceding 126 trading days. 
For the strategy labeled “dyn, out-of-sample,” the WML portfolio weights 
each month are multiplied each month by w ∗ in Eq. (6) , where μt−1 is 
the out-of-sample WML mean-return forecast (in Eq. 9) , and σ 2 
t−1 is the 
realized variance of the daily WML returns over the preceding 126 trad- 
ing days. The strategy labeled “dyn, in-sample” is the dynamic strategy 
discussed in Section 4.1 , with the parameters in the mean and variance 
forecast estimated over the full sample. The column labeled “Appraisal ra- 
tio” gives the annualized Treynor and Black (1973) appraisal ratio of the 
strategy in that row, relative to the strategy in the preceding row.

This table presents the results of spanning tests of the dynamic (Panel A) and constant volatility (Panel B) portfolios with respect to the market (Mkt), the

volatility strategy increases the Sharpe ratio from 0.682 to 
1.041. We know that to increase the Sharpe ratio by that 
amount, the WML strategy is combined with an (orthog- 
1 . 041 2 − 0 . 682 2 = 
onal) strategy with a Sharpe ratio of 
0 . 786 , which is also the value of the Treynor and Black ap- 
praisal ratio. 

(cid:7) 

The  last  two  rows  of  Table  7  show  that  going  from 
in-sample  to  out-of-sample  results  in  only  a  very  small 
decrease in performance for the dynamic strategy. Going 
from the constant volatility strategy to the out-of-sample 
dynamic strategy continues to result in a fairly substantial 
performance increase equivalent to adding on an orthog- 
1 . 194 2 − 1 . 041 2 = 
onal  strategy  with  a  Sharpe  ratio  of 
0 . 585 . This performance increase can be decomposed into 
two roughly equal parts: one part is the performance in- 
crease that comes from scaling by variance instead of by 
volatility,  and  the  other  second  component  comes  from 
forecasting the mean, which continues to result in a sub- 
stantial performance gain (AR = 0.396) even though we are 
doing a full out-of-sample forecast of the mean return and 
variance of WML. 

(cid:7) 

4.4. Spanning tests 

A more formal test of the dynamic portfolio’s success 
is  to  conduct  spanning  tests  with  respect  to  the  other 
momentum  strategies  and  other  factors.  Using  daily  re- 
turns, we regress the dynamic portfolio’s returns on a host 
of  factors  that  include  the  market  and  Fama  and  French 
(1993)  factors  as  well  as  the  static  WML  and  constant 
volatility (cvol) momentum strategies. The annualized al- 
phas from these regressions are reported in Table 8 . 

The  ﬁrst  column  of  Panel  A  of  Table  8  reports  re- 
sults  from  regressions  of  our  dynamic  momentum  port- 
folio on the market plus the static momentum portfolio, 
WML. The intercept is highly signiﬁcant at 23.74% per an- 
num ( t -statistic = 11.99), indicating that the dynamic port- 
folio’s returns are not captured by the market or the static 

momentum portfolio. Because this regression controls only 
for unconditional market exposure, the second column of 
Panel A reports regression results that include interactions 
of  our  panic state  indicators with  the  market  to  capture 
the  conditional  variability  in  beta.  The  alpha  is  virtually 
unchanged and remains positive and highly signiﬁcant. The 
third column then adds the Fama and French (1993) factors 
SMB and HML and their interactions with the panic state 
variables to account for conditional variability in exposure 
to the market, size, and value factors. This regression ac- 
counts for whether our dynamic portfolio is merely rotat- 
ing exposure to these factors. 12 Again, the alpha with re- 
spect to this conditional model is strong and signiﬁcant at 
22% per year, nearly identical in magnitude to the ﬁrst two 
columns. Hence, our dynamic momentum strategy’s abnor- 
mal performance is not being driven by dynamic exposure 
to these other factors or to the static momentum portfolio. 
Columns 4 through 6 of Panel A of Table 8 repeat the 
regressions  from  Columns  1  through  3  by  replacing  the 
static  WML  portfolio  with  the  constant  volatility  (cvol) 
momentum  portfolio.  The  alphas  drop  in  magnitude  to 
about  7%  per  year  but  remain  highly  statistically  signiﬁ- 
cant ( t -statistic between 6 and 7), suggesting that the dy- 
namic momentum portfolio is not spanned by the constant 
volatility portfolio. 

Panel B of Table 8 ﬂips the analysis around and exam- 
ines whether the constant volatility portfolio is spanned by 
the static WML portfolio or the dynamic portfolio. The ﬁrst 
three columns of Panel B indicate that the constant volatil- 
ity portfolio is not spanned by the static WML portfolio or 
the Fama and French (1993) factors, generating alphas of 

12 
Because the optimal dynamic portfolio solved in Appendix C is not 
conditional on other factors, to form this portfolio in the presence of 
other factors we ﬁrst regress the static momentum portfolio on the other 
factors using daily returns and then use the residuals to form our dy- 
namic strategy by forecasting the conditional mean and variance of those 
residuals to form the dynamic weights.

about  14%  per  annum  with  highly  signiﬁcant  t -statistics. 
These results are consistent with Barroso and Santa-Clara 
(2015) . However, the alphas of the constant volatility port- 
folio are slightly smaller in magnitude than those from the 
dynamic strategy, consistent with the Sharpe ratio compar- 
isons from Fig. 6 . (Because we scale both the dynamic and 
constant  volatility  portfolios  to  have  the  same  variance, 
these alphas are comparable and give the same rankings 
as information ratios would.) 

Columns 4 through 6 of Panel B report results from re- 
gressing  the  constant  volatility  portfolio’s  returns  on  the 
dynamic portfolio’s returns. Here, the alphas are all zero, 
both economically and statistically, suggesting that the dy- 
namic portfolio spans the constant volatility portfolio. Ac- 
cording  to  Appendix  C ,  this  should  be  the  case  in  the- 
ory, thus implying that we obtain decent ex ante forecasts 
of the conditional mean and variance of the static WML 
portfolio to form a dynamic strategy that reliably captures 
and improves upon the returns to a constant volatility and 
static momentum portfolio. 

5. International equities and other asset classes 

Price  momentum  was  ﬁrst  shown  in  individual  equi- 
ties in the US. However, subsequent research has demon- 
strated  the  existence  of  strong  momentum  effects  both 
among common stocks in other investment regions and in 
other asset classes (see Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen 
(2013) for a summary). 

We  investigate  whether  the  same  momentum  crash 
patterns  we  observe  in  US  equities  are  also  present  in 
these other asset markets and whether our dynamic mo- 
mentum portfolio helps ameliorate these crashes and im- 
proves momentum performance in other markets. 

5.1. Data 

The data come from Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen 
(2013) and for equities cover the US, UK, Japan, and Conti- 
nental Europe. Details on data description and sources can 
be found in Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) . The 
US  and  UK  data  begin  in  January  1972  and  Europe  and 
Japan in February 1974, extending to May 2013. 13 We also 
examine a global equity momentum strategy (GE), which 
weights each region’s equity momentum strategy by the ex 
post volatility of the portfolio over the full sample, follow- 
ing Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) . 

The non-equity data also come from Asness, Moskowitz, 
and Pedersen (2013) . They contain equity country index fu- 
tures across 18 developed equity markets beginning in Jan- 
uary 1978, ten currencies across developed markets start- 
ing in January 1979, ten country government bonds begin- 
ning January 1982, and 27 different commodity futures be- 
ginning in January 1972. All series end in May 2013. 

13 
These data extend beyond the original sample period used in Asness, 
Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) , as the data are updated monthly follow- 
ing the same procedure for portfolio construction in Asness, Moskowitz, 
and Pedersen (2013) . The data are available from: https://www.aqr.com/ 
library/data-sets/value-and-momentum-everywhere-factors-monthly . 

In addition, we examine two composite portfolios: GA 
is a global momentum strategy across the non-equity asset 
classes, which weights each asset class momentum strat- 
egy portfolio by the ex post volatility of that portfolio. GAll 
is a global momentum strategy across all of the equity and 
non-equity  asset  classes,  which  weights  the  GE  and  GA 
portfolios by their ex post return volatilities over the full 
sample. 

The deﬁnition of the market index is different for each 
market and asset class. It is the MSCI local index for the 
US, UK, Europe, and Japan, the MSCI World index for coun- 
try index futures, an equal-weighted average of all country 
bonds for bond markets, an equal-weighted average of all

5.2. Cross-sectional equity momentum outside the US 

The  portfolio  formation  procedure  here  is  similar  to 
that used earlier in the paper, except that, instead of taking 
the top and bottom decile portfolios, we use the Asness, 
Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) P3–P1 momentum portfo- 
lios, which is long the top third and short the bottom third 
of securities ranked on returns from month t − 12 through 
month t − 2 . Both the long and the short side of the port- 
folio are value weighted. As shown in Asness, Moskowitz, 
and Pedersen (2013) , over this time period there are strong 
momentum effects in each of the regions except Japan. 

Panels  A  through  D  of  Table  9  present  the  results  of 
the regressions run in Section 2 , but for the other stock 
market universes. Panel A shows the estimated coeﬃcients 
and t -statistics from the regression speciﬁcation in Eq. (2) . 
Consistent  with  the  results  presented  earlier,  the  market 
betas  of  the  momentum  strategy  are  dramatically  lower 
in  bear  markets  across  the  other  stock  markets  as  well. 
The strategies implemented using European and Japanese 
stocks have market betas that are approximately 0.5 lower 
during bear markets (with t -statistics of about −7). The UK 
momentum strategy beta falls by 0.2. The drop in this pe- 
riod  for  the  US  momentum  strategy  is  0.58,  comparable 
to  the WML portfolio over the longer 1927–2013 period. 
Globally, averaging across the US, UK, Europe, and Japan, 
the market betas of the momentum strategy are markedly 
lower in bear markets. 

The abnormal returns of the momentum strategies are 
signiﬁcantly positive in bull markets for all regions except 
Japan. Consistent with our analysis in Section 2 , the return 
is  lower  in  bear  markets  in  each  region,  although,  using 
only the bear market indicator as a proxy for panic periods, 
none of the differences is statistically signiﬁcant over these 
shorter sample periods. 

Panel B investigates the optionality in the momentum 
strategy in bear markets using the regression speciﬁcation 
in  Eq.  (3) .  Consistent  with  the  longer  period  US  results, 
there is statistically signiﬁcant optionality in bear markets 
in the European, UK, and Japan stock markets and globally 
across  all  markets.  For  this  subsample  and  methodology, 
the  optionality  is  of  the  right  sign,  but  it  is  not  statis- 
tically  signiﬁcant  for  the  US  market.  The  negative  beta 
of  long-short  momentum  strategies  is  particularly  acute 
when the contemporaneous market return is positive. That

Two interesting results emerge. First, higher ex ante mar- 
ket  variance  is  generally  associated  with  more  negative 
momentum strategy betas. Second, higher market variance 
is also associated with strongly lower future abnormal re- 
turns to momentum, net of the market return. This last re- 
lation is statistically signiﬁcant in all markets, and again is 
consistent with our earlier results for the US market over 
the longer period. 

In  Panel  D,  we  again  use  the  I 

Bσ 2 ≡ (1 / ¯v B )I B,t−1 · ˆ σ 2 
m 
measure  introduced  in  Section  3.6 ,  designed  to  capture 
panic periods when the market has fallen and volatility is 
high. In addition, in these regressions, we instrument for 
time variation in market beta using I B,t−1 ,  ˆ σ 2 
Bσ 2 . 
We run the regression

The results in Panel D of Table 9 are consistent with our 
earlier results for the US over the longer period. The coeﬃ- 
cient on the interaction term I 
Bσ 2 is negative, economically 
large, and statistically signiﬁcant in all markets and for the 
global strategy. 

In summary, the results in Table 9 suggest that momen- 
tum  strategies  in  these  different  equity  markets  are  also 
short volatility and have signiﬁcantly lower abnormal re- 
turns in panic periods characterized by poor lagged market 
returns and high market volatility. 

One other point of interest is that, in Panels C and D of 
Table 9 , the  ˆ α for the Japan momentum strategy is consid- 
erably larger, and in Panel C it is in fact signiﬁcant at a 5% 
level. We explore the implications of this ﬁnding further in 
Section 5.4 , where we apply a dynamic Japanese momen- 
tum strategy that takes into account the forecastability of 
both the expected return and volatilty. 

5.3. Cross-sectional momentum in other asset classes 

Evidence  of  the  option-like  payoffs  of  momentum 
strategies in bear markets outside of US equities, and in ev- 
ery other equity market we examine, gives credence to this 
feature  of  momentum  being  a  robust  phenomenon  and 
not likely due to chance. For further robustness, we exam- 
ine momentum strategies in the non-equity asset classes. 
In  addition  to  providing  another  out  of  sample  test  for 
the  option-like  payoffs  of  momentum  strategies  in  bear 
markets, ﬁnding the same option-like asymmetry in these 
asset  classes  would  present  a  challenge  to  the  Merton 
(1974) explanation. 

Table  10  presents  the  results  of  time  series  regres- 
sions for the non-equity asset class momentum strategies 

is,  momentum  strategies  in  all  regions  across  the  world 
exhibit  conditional  betas  and  payoffs  similar  to  writing 
call options on the local market index. 

In Panel C, we add as a conditioning variable the re- 
alized  daily  market  return  variance,  annualized,  over  the 

14 
This is the same market variance measure used earlier. However, for 
the European Union (EU), Japan, and UK, we have daily MSCI market re- 
turn data only for the time period from January 1990 on. Therefore, over 
the period from 1972:01 to 1990:06 in the UK and 1974:02 to 1990:06 in 
the EU and Japan, we use the realized monthly variance over the preced- 
ing six months, again annualized.

similar to those in Table 9 for international equities. First, 
the set of I B,t−1 · ˜ R e 
m  coeﬃcients and t -statistics in the last 
row of Panel A shows that, in all asset classes, the momen- 
tum portfolio’s market beta is signiﬁcantly more negative 
in bear markets. The intuition that, following a bear mar- 
ket,  the  loser  side  of  the  momentum  portfolio  will  have 
a  high  market  beta  remains  valid  in  the  non-equity  as- 
set  classes  as  well.  The  I B,t−1  coeﬃcients  in  the  second 
row  of  Panel  A  also  provide  evidence  weakly  consistent 
with the earlier ﬁnding that market-adjusted momentum 
returns are lower following bear markets. The point esti- 
mates are all negative, except for bonds, but only in the 
currency market is the coeﬃcient signiﬁcant. 

Panel  B  assesses  whether  the  optionality  present  in 
cross-sectional equity momentum strategies is also present 
in other asset classes. The I B,t−1 ˜ I U,t ˜ R e 
m,t coeﬃcient is nega- 
tive for each of the four asset classes and the two com- 
posite portfolios, but  it is statistically signiﬁcant at  a 5% 
level only for commodities. This result is intriguing. While 
a model such as Merton (1974) argues that equities should 
exhibit  option-like  features,  it  is  not  clear  that  such  a 
model would easily explain the optionality present in com- 
modity futures and weakly in currency markets. 

Panel C of Table 10 estimates Eq. (10) for the other as- 
set class momentum strategies. The signs of the relation 
between lagged volatility and momentum strategy returns 
are again negative in the commodity (CM), currency (FX), 
and equity (EQ) futures asset classes. Panel D uses the in- 
teractive  variable  I 
Bσ 2  as  an  instrument  for  volatile  bear 
markets. As in Table 9 , we control for variation in market 
beta associated with I B,t−1 ,  ˆ σ 2 
m , and the interaction term 
itself. In all asset classes except ﬁxed income (FI), the coef- 
ﬁcient on this interaction term is negative, consistent with 
our previous ﬁndings in US and international equity mar- 
kets. However, except for FX and the GAll portfolio, the co- 
eﬃcient is not signiﬁcant at a 5% level. 

These  ﬁndings  are  largely  consistent  with  the  results 
for US equities and for other equity markets. In addition 
to providing more robustness, these ﬁndings make it more 
diﬃcult to reconcile under a Merton (1974) –style theory, 
which is better suited for equity returns. 

5.4. Dynamic strategies in other markets and asset classes 

Given the robustness of the option-like features to mo- 
mentum in other equity markets and other asset classes, 
we examine the eﬃcacy of the dynamic momentum strate- 
gies constructed as in Section 4 to examine whether the 
dynamic strategy continues to perform well when imple- 
mented in these other asset markets. 

We  form  the  dynamic  momentum  strategy  as  before 
using  the  ex  ante  expected  return  and  volatility  of  the 
WML portfolio in each market using the instruments from 
the previous analysis—the interaction of the ex-ante bear 
market  indicator  for  that  asset  class,  I B,t−1  and  the  as- 
set class market volatility over the preceding six months 
to  forecast  the  conditional  expected  return  and  volatil- 
ity. Precise speciﬁcations of the forecasting model and the 
GARCH model parameters for each asset class are given in

Table 11 
Dynamic and constant volatility momentum across asset classes. 

Panel A presents the annualized Sharpe ratios of monthly momentum strategies in each of the different asset classes and markets we study. For each asset 
class, WML (winner-minus-loser) denotes the baseline $1 long–$1 short static momentum strategy, cvol denotes the constant-volatility strategy in which 
the WML weights are scaled by the ex ante forecast volatility of the WML strategy, using daily returns over the prior six months to estimate volatility, 
and dyn is the dynamic, maximum Sharpe ratio strategy described in Appendix C , which dynamically weights the momentum strategy by the conditional 
Sharpe ratio using ex ante forecasts of the conditional mean and variance of the momentum strategy’s returns using our market stress indicators and past 
six-month volatility estimates. ∗ indicates a fully dynamic implementation in which the weighted combination of the dynamic strategies themselves is also 
employed to aggregate up to the global equity (GE) global asset class (GA) and global all (GAll) strategies that combine strategies across regions and asset 
classes. For all other global combinations, each of the component strategies is scaled to have equal volatility and then the strategies are equally weighted. 
Panel B reports the intercepts or alphas and their t -statistics from spanning regressions of the cvol and optimal dynamic (dyn) portfolios in each market 
and asset class on the static WML momentum strategy and on each other, within each market and asset class. Each spanning regression also includes 
the market portfolio for that asset class and the interactions of the market portfolio with the panic state indicator I 
Bσ 2  for each asset class to capture 
conditional variation in the betas. The starting date for each series is indicated in the table; all series end in 2013:05. EU = European Union; JP = Japan;

Panel A of Table 11 reports the Sharpe ratio and skew- 
ness (in parentheses) of the simple $1 long–$1 short WML 
momentum strategy in each market and asset class, as well 
as  a  constant  volatility  momentum  strategy  and  the  dy- 
namic  momentum  strategy  as  described  above.  In  addi- 
tion, we report global combinations of the equity momen- 
tum strategies across all markets (GE), the non-equity asset 
classes (GA), and a combination of all equity markets and 
non-equity asset classes (GAll). 

As Panel A of Table 11 shows, a marked improvement 
in Sharpe ratio exists going from the static WML momen- 
tum strategy to a constant volatility momentum strategy 
to our dynamic momentum strategy in every single mar- 
ket and asset class we study except ﬁxed income. In most 
cases, our dynamic strategy doubles the Sharpe ratio over 
the  traditional  static  momentum  portfolio.  Furthermore, 
our  dynamic  momentum  strategy  resurrects  positive  re- 
turns  in  markets  in  which  the  typical  momentum  port- 
folio has failed to produce positive proﬁts, such as Japan. 
In Japan, the static, classic momentum portfolio delivers a 
0.07  Sharpe  ratio,  but  our  dynamic  momentum  portfolio 
in Japan produces a 0.42 Sharpe ratio. (Alas, even the dy- 

namic strategy does not deliver a signiﬁcant Sharpe ratio 
for ﬁxed income.) 

The  skewness  numbers  (in  parentheses)  are  also  in- 
teresting, as the predominantly negative skewness of the 
static momentum strategies across all markets is apparent, 
but the dynamic momentum strategies deliver mostly pos- 
itive skewness consistent with amelioration of the crashes 
in plots of the returns to these strategies. 

We also report results for a fully dynamic portfolio that 
is  a  weighted  combination  of  the  individual  asset  class 
or  market  dynamic  strategies,  in  which  the  weighs  are 
based on the ex ante conditional volatility of each com- 
ponent  strategy.  That  is,  each  of  the  component  strate- 
gies is scaled to have equal volatility (ex ante), and then 
the  strategies  are  equally  weighted.  In  this  way,  we  are 
also  using  cross-sectional  information on  the  strength  of 
the dynamic signal of each component strategy to build a 
fully dynamic combination portfolio across all asset classes. 
We denote these fully dynamic strategies with an asterisk 
( ∗)  in  Table  11 .  As  the  table  indicates  additional  Sharpe 
ratio  improvement  is  evident  from  this  additional  twist 
on our dynamic momentum strategies, providing another

robustness test on the use of conditional mean and vari- 
ance  forecastability  in  enhancing  the  returns  to  momen- 
tum strategies. 

Panel  B  of  Table  11  reports  results  from  spanning 
tests  of  the  static  WML  portfolio,  the  constant  volatility 
strategy,  and  the  dynamic  strategy  within  each  market 
and asset class. These daily return regressions also include 
interactions  of  the  excess  market  return  and  the  excess 
market  return  (for  that  asset  class)  interacted  with  the 
asset  class  speciﬁc  panic  state  indicator  I 
Bσ 2  to  capture 
conditional variation in the betas. 15  The ﬁrst row reports 
alphas  (and  their  t -statistics)  of  the  constant  volatility 
strategy on WML in each market and asset class, as well 
as globally across equity markets (GE), asset classes (GA), 
and  all  markets  and  asset  classes  (GAll).  Consistent  with 
the results of Barroso and Santa-Clara (2015) for US equi- 
ties, the constant volatility strategy delivers positive alpha 
relative to the static momentum strategy in every single 
market  and  asset  class  that  is  highly  signiﬁcant  (except 
Japan and ﬁxed income, where momentum does not yield 
statistically signiﬁcant positive returns to begin with). 

The second row reports alphas of the dynamic momen- 
tum strategy with respect to WML. Here too the alphas are 
all positive and statistically signiﬁcant and, in every single 
market and asset class, are larger than the constant volatil- 
ity momentum alphas. Because both the dynamic and con- 
stant volatility strategies are scaled to the same volatility, 
this  suggests  that  the  dynamic  momentum  portfolio  of- 
fers improved mean-variance eﬃciency over the constant 
volatility portfolio, which it should according to theory. 

To test this notion more formally, the last two sets of 
rows  of  Panel  B  of  Table  11  report  the  alphas  from  re- 
gressions of the dynamic strategy returns on the constant 
volatility strategy returns, and vice versa. The results are 
consistent  with  our  previous  ﬁndings.  In  virtually  every 
market and asset class, the dynamic momentum portfolio 
delivers positive and statistically signiﬁcant alpha relative 
to the constant volatility strategy, suggesting that the con- 
stant volatility strategy does not span the dynamic strat- 
egy in any market or asset class. Conversely, in every mar- 
ket and asset class the constant volatility strategy fails to 
produce  a  signiﬁcant  alpha  with  respect  to  the  dynamic 
strategy, suggesting that the dynamic momentum strategy 
spans the constant volatility strategy in every market and 
asset  class.  These  results,  shown  out-of-sample  in  eight 
other markets and asset classes, make a compelling case 
for  the  robustness  of  the  dynamic  momentum  portfolio 
based on the optionality insights of momentum strategies 
in every market. 

Overall,  the  consistent  evidence  of  the  optionality  of 
momentum  strategies,  conditional  betas  and  return  pre- 
mia,  and  the  signiﬁcant  improvement  from  our  dynamic 
weighting  scheme  across  many  different  markets  and 
vastly different asset classes provides a wealth of out- of-

As with our spanning tests in Section 4 , the dynamic strategy used 
in Panel B is based on ex ante forecasts of the mean and variance of the 
residual from a regression of the WML strategy on the excess market re-

indicator and lagged residual variances as forecasting variables. See foot-

bility by bear market and ex ante volatility measures are 
a reliable and robust feature of momentum strategies that 
can provide clues as to the underlying source of this return 
factor. 16 

6. Conclusions 

In normal environments, consistent price momentum is 
both statistically and economically strong and manifests it- 
self across numerous equity markets and a wide range of 
diverse asset classes. 

However, in panic states, following multi year market 
drawdowns  and  in  periods  of  high  market  volatility,  the 
prices of past losers embody a high premium. When poor 
market conditions ameliorate and the market starts to re- 
bound,  the  losers  experience  strong  gains,  resulting  in  a 
momentum crash as momentum strategies short these as- 
sets. We ﬁnd that, in bear market states, and in particu- 
lar  when  market  volatility  is  high,  the  down-market  be- 
tas of the past losers are low, but the up-market betas are 
very  large.  This  optionality  does  not  appear  to  generally 
be reﬂected in the prices of the past losers. Consequently, 
the expected returns of the past losers are very high, and 
the momentum effect is reversed during these times. This 
feature  does  not  apply  equally  to  winners  during  good 
times,  however,  resulting  in  an  asymmetry  in  the  win- 
ner and loser exposure to market returns during extreme 
times. 

These results are shown to be robust. We obtain con- 
sistent results in eight different markets and asset classes, 
as well as in multiple time periods. Moreover, these crash 
periods  are  predictable.  We  use  bear  market  indicators 
and ex ante volatility estimates to forecast the conditional 
mean and variance of momentum strategies. Armed with 
these estimates, we create a simple dynamically weighted 
version  of  the  momentum  portfolio  that  approximately 
doubles  the  Sharpe  ratio  of  the  static  momentum  strat- 
egy and is not spanned by constant volatility momentum 
strategies or other factors, and we do so consistently in ev- 
ery market, asset class, and time period we study. 

What can explain these ﬁndings? We examine a vari- 
ety of explanations ranging from compensation for crash 
risk to volatility risk, to other factor risks such as the Fama 
and French (1993) factors, but we ﬁnd that none of these 
explanations  can  account  fully  for  our  ﬁndings.  For  eq- 
uity momentum, a Merton (1974) story for the option-like 
payoffs of equities could make sense, but the existence of 
the same phenomena and option-like features for momen- 
tum strategies in futures, bonds, currencies, and commodi- 
ties makes this story more challenging. Alternatively, these 
effects  can  be  loosely  consistent  with  several  behavioral 
ﬁndings, in which in extreme situations individuals tend to 
be fearful and appear to focus on losses, largely ignoring 

16 
Although beyond the scope of this paper, it would be interesting to 
see if other momentum-type strategies, such as earnings momentum in 
equities ( Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok, 1996 ), or time-series momen- 
tum in futures contracts ( Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen, 2012 ), or cross- 
momentum effects ( Cohen and Frazzini, 2008 ) exhibit similar features.

fully consistent with the empirical results shown here is 
a subject for further research and would indicate that the 
behavior of market participants in each of these markets 
and asset classes is affected similarly, despite the fact that 
the average and marginal investor in these various markets 
are likely to be different along many other dimensions.

Appendix A. Detailed description of calculations 

A.1. Cumulative return calculations 

The cumulative return on an (implementable) strategy 
is  an  investment  at  time  0,  which  is  fully  reinvested  at 
each point i.e., when no cash is put in or taken out. That 
is, the cumulative arithmetic returns between times t and 
T is denoted R ( t, T ). 

T (cid:8) 

R (t, T ) = 

(1 + R s ) − 1 , 

s = t+1 

(12) 

where R s denotes the arithmetic return in the period end- 
ing at time t , and r s = log (1 + R s ) denotes the log-return 
over period s , 

r(t, T ) = 

T (cid:2) 

r s . 

s = t+1 

(13) 

where the terms R L, s , R S, s , and R 
f, s  are, respectively, the 
return on the long side of the portfolio, the short side of 
the portfolio, and the risk-free rate. Thus, the strategy re- 
ﬂects the cumulative return, with an initial investment of 
V t , which is managed in the following two steps. 

1. Using the $ V 

0 as margin, you purchase $ V 

0 of the long 
0 worth of the short 
side of the portfolio, and short $ V 
side of the portfolio. Note that this is consistent with 
Regulation T requirements. Over each period s , the mar- 
gin posted earns interest at rate R 

f, s . 

2. At the end of each period, the value of the investments 
on the long and the short side of the portfolio are ad- 
justed to reﬂect gains to both the long and short side of 
the portfolio. So, for example, at the end of the ﬁrst pe- 
riod, the investments in both the long and short side of 
the portfolio are adjusted to set their value equal to the 
total value of the portfolio to V t+1 = V t · (1 + R L − R S + 
f ) . 
R 

This  methodology  assumes  that  there  are  no  margin 
calls, etc., except at the end of each month. These calcu- 
lated returns do not incorporate transaction costs. 

A.2. Calculation of variance swap returns 

We calculate the returns to a daily variance swap on the 
S&P 500 using daily observations on the Standard & Poor’s 
500 Index (SPX) and the VIX and daily levels of the one- 
month Treasury bill rate. The historical daily observations 
on the SPX and the VIX, beginning on January 2, 1990, are 
taken from the Chicago Board Options Exhange (CBOE) VIX 
website. 18 The daily one-month interest rate series is taken 
from Ken French’s data library. 

The  VIX  is  calculated  using  a  panel  of  S&P  500  in- 
dex options with a wide range of strike prices and with 
two maturity dates, generally the two closest-to-maturity 
contracts,  weighted  in  such  a  way  so  as  to  most  closely 
approximate  the  swap  rate  for  a  variance  swap  with  a 
constant  maturity  of  30  calendar  days. 19  The  calculation 
method used by the CBOE makes the VIX equivalent to the 
swap  rate  for  a  variance  swap  on  the  S&P  500  over  the 
coming 30 calendar days. However, the methodology used 
by the CBOE is to 1 annualize this variance (2) and take the 
square-root of the variance (to convert to volatility), mul- 
tiply by one hundred to convert to percentage terms. 

Given the VIX construction methodology, we can calcu- 
late the daily return on a variance swap, from day t −1 to 
day t , as

For long-short portfolios, the cumulative return is 

T (cid:8) 

R (t, T ) = 

(1 + R L,s − R S,s + R 

f,t ) − 1 , 

(14) 

D t  is  the  20  trading  day  discount  factor.  This  is  calcu- 
lated as D t = (1 + r 1 m,t ) 20 / 252 , where r 
1 m, t  is the annual- 
ized one-month treasury bill yield as of day t , from Ken 

s = t+1

French’s website. VIX t is the level of the VIX as quoted at 
the end of day t and S t is the level of the S&P 500, adjusted 
for all corporate actions, at the end of day t . The factors of 
252 and 100 in the equation are because the VIX is quoted 
in annualized, percentage terms. 

This  equation  is  given  a  ﬂat  forward  variance  curve. 
That is, we are implicitly making the assumption that the 
swap rate on 20 trading day and 21 trading day variance 
swap rates on day t are identical (and equal to VIX 2 
t ). For 
the market, this approximation should be fairly accurate. 

Appendix B. Exposure to size and value factors 

We regress the WML momentum portfolio returns on 
the  three  Fama  and  French  (1993)  factors  consisting  of 
the CRSP VW index return in excess of the risk-free rate, 
a small minus big (SMB) stock factor, and a high BE/ME 
minus  low  BE/ME  (HML)  factor,  all  obtained  from  Ken 
French’s website. In addition, we interact each of the fac- 
tors with the panic state variable I 
Bσ 2 . The results are re- 
ported in Table B1 , in which the abnormal performance of 
momentum continues to be signiﬁcantly more negative in 
bear market states, whether we measure abnormal perfor- 
mance relative to the market model or to the Fama and 
French (1993) three-factor model, with little difference in 
the point estimates. 

The next two columns of the table repeat the market 
model  regressions  using  HML  as  the  dependent  variable 
instead of WML. For these regressions, we use the mod- 
iﬁed HML portfolio of Asness and Frazzini (2011) . Asness 
and Frazzini show that the Fama and French (1993) HML 
construction, by using lagged market prices in its BE/ME 
calculations,  inherently  induces  some  positive  covariance 
with  momentum.  They  advocate  using  the  most  recent 
(last month’s) price to compute BE/ME ratios in construct- 

ing  their  HML  factor,  which  they  term  HML-devil  (HML- 
d),  to  examine  the  value  effect  separately  from  momen- 
tum. As Table B1 shows, the abnormal return of the HML 
portfolio increases in the panic states, the opposite of what 
we ﬁnd for momentum. This is not surprising for several 
reasons. First, momentum strategies buy past winners and 
sell past losers, while value strategies typically buy longer- 
term past losers and sell winners [see DeBondt and Thaler 
(1987)  and  Fama  and  French  (1996) ].  Also,  the  correla- 
tion between HML-d and UMD is approximately -0.50. Fi- 
nally, this result is consistent with the intuition for why 
the market beta of the WML portfolio changes with past 
market returns. Because growth (low book-to-price) stocks 
have generally had high past returns and value stocks low 
past returns, the same intuition suggests that HML’s beta 
should  be  high  when  I B,t−1 = 1 ,  and  it  is.  HML’s  market 
beta is higher by 0.33 when I B,t−1 = 1 ( t -statistic = 16.3), 
as  indicated  by  the  interaction  term.  More  directly,  the 
correlation of HML with the excess return on the market 
during panic states is 0.59, but during normal times it is 
−0 . 10 . Conversely, for the WML portfolio, the correlation 
with  the  market  is  0.02  during  normal  times  and  −0.71 
when I B,t−1 = 1 . 

The  next  two  columns  of  Table  B1  repeat  this  exer- 
cise  using  SMB  as  the  dependent variable.  The  premium 
on SMB is statistically signiﬁcantly higher in panic states 
as well, but its beta does not change signiﬁcantly during 
these states. This makes sense because size is a poor proxy 
for recent short-term performance. 

Finally,  the  last  two  columns  run  regressions  for  a 
50–50 combination of WML and HML-d following Asness, 
Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) , who show that a com- 
bination  of  value  and  momentum  diversiﬁes  away  a  va- 
riety of exposures including aggregate market and liquid- 
ity risks. Given the opposite-signed results for WML and

This table presents the results of monthly time-series regressions. The dependent variable is indicated at the head of each column, and is either: WML, 
the HML–devil (HML-d) portfolio of Asness and Frazzini (2011) , the SMB portfolio return of Fama and French (1993) ; or (4) a portfolio which is 50% WML 
and 50% HML-devil. The independent variables are intercept α, the normalized ex ante forecasting variable I 
m , and this forecasting 
variable interacted with the excess market return and the Fama and French (1993) HML and SMB returns. The sample is January 1927–March 2013 for the 
WML and SMB regressions and January 1927–December 2012 for the HML-d and WML + HML-d portfolios. The coeﬃcients for α and I

HML-d on the panic state variables, it is not surprising that 
a  combination  of  WML  and  HML-d  hedges  some  of  this 
risk. However, since the magnitude of the effects on WML 
are much larger than those of HML, the net effect is still 
a reduction in returns and a decrease in beta during panic 
states for the momentum-value combination. 20 

Appendix C. Maximum Sharpe ratio strategy 

The  setting  is  discrete  time  with  T  periods  from 
1 , . . . , T . We can trade in two assets, a risky asset and a 
risk free asset. Our objective is to maximize the Sharpe ra- 
tio of a portfolio in which, each period, we can trade in or 
out of the risky asset with no cost. 

Over period t + 1 which is the span from t to t + 1 , the 
excess return on a risky asset ˜ r t+1 is distributed normally, 
with time- t conditional mean μt and conditional variance 
σ 2 
t . That is, 
μt = E t [ ˜ r t+1 ]

and

where we assume that at t = 0 the agent knows μt and σ t 
for t ∈ { 0 , . . . , T − 1 } . 

(17) 

, 

The  agent’s  objective  is  to  maximize  the  full-period 
Sharpe  ratio  of  a  managed  portfolio.  The  agent  manages 
the portfolio by placing, at the beginning of each period, 
a fraction w t of the value of the managed portfolio in the 
risky asset and a fraction 1 − w t in the risk-free asset. The 
time t expected excess return and variance of the managed 
portfolio in period t + 1 is then given by

One possibility for the dominance of momentum here is that the 50–
50 momentum-value weighting is based on equal dollar allocation to both 
rather than equal risk allocation. Since momentum is more volatile than 
value, this may be tilting the overall exposure of the combination portfo- 
lio more toward momentum.

Appendix D. GJR-GARCH forecasts of volatility 

The construction of the dynamic portfolio strategy we 
explore in Sections 4 and 5.4 requires estimates of the con- 
ditional mean return and the conditional volatility of the 
momentum  strategies.  To  forecast  the  volatility,  we  ﬁrst 
ﬁt  a  GARCH  process  to  the  daily  momentum  returns  of 
each  asset  class.  We  ﬁt  the  GARCH  model  proposed  by 
Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle (1993) and summarized 
by Eqs. (7) and (8) .The maximum likelihood estimates and 
t -statistics are:

tifying the use of OLS standard errors. Also, the t -statistics on the lag 2–

dent variable of the regression ( ˆ σ22 ,t ) is large and statistically signiﬁcant 
( ˆ ρ1 = 0 . 55 , t -statistic = 24 . 5 ). This suggests that the autocorrelation in 
ˆ σ22 ,t results from its forecastable component. The residual from its pro- 
jection on the forecast variables is uncorrelated at any conventional sta- 
tistically signiﬁcant level.

Maximum likelihood estimates of GJR-GARCH model for momentum portfolios. 

Panel A presents the maximum-likelihood estimates of the coeﬃcients of the Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle (1993) –generalized autoregressive con- 
ditional heteroskedasticity (GJR–GARCH) model, given by Eqs. (7) and (8) , ﬁtted to daily returns for each of the momentum portfolios we examine in 
Section 5.4 . The estimates of the μ and ω coeﬃcients are multiplied by 10 3 
, respectively. Maximum likelihood–based t-statistics are given in 
parentheses. For β, this t-statistic tests whether β = 1 ; for all other parameters, it tests whether the parameter is zero. Panel B presents the results of 
monthly regressions in which we regress the future one month daily volatility of the winner-minus-loser (WML) portfolio on an intercept ( α), on the 
lagged 126-day WML return volatility ( σ 126 ), and on the lagged GJR-GARCH volatility ( σ GARCH ). The starting date for each series is indicated in the table.

Panel B: Time series regression coeﬃcient estimates 
α( × 10 2 
) 

and regression estimates and t -statistics are presented in 
Table D1 . 

The  parameters  above  and  in  Table  D1  tell  an  inter- 
esting  story.  First,  in  the  regressions,  the  coeﬃcient  on 
the GJR-GARCH estimate of volatility is always signiﬁcant, 
and the coeﬃcient on the lagged 126-day volatility is al- 
ways smaller but not always statistically signiﬁcant. There 
appears to be a longer-lived component of volatility that 
ˆ σ126 ,t is capturing. 

Also interesting is the leverage parameter γ . In each of 
the asset classes, the maximum-likelihood estimate of γ
is negative, which means that a strong negative return on 
the WML portfolio is generally associated with a decrease 
in the WML return variance. As noted elsewhere in the lit- 
erature, this coeﬃcient is positive at high levels of statis- 
tical signiﬁcance for the market return (see, e.g., Glosten, 
Jagannathan, and Runkle (1993) and Engle and Ng (1993) ).
