INTRODUCTION  TO ORDER FLOW  
My name is Michael Valtos and since 1994 I have been trading for banks 
(JP Morgan and Commerzba nk) as well commodity trading houses 
(Cargill and EDF Man) and for myself. While trading for the investment 
banks I learned how to get information out of the market and how to 
trade off that information into a profitable position; when there is an 
opportun ity to earn a significant return relative to risk you get into a 
position. While trading at commodity trading houses I learned to think 
how commercial end -users think; you are always in a position just by 
being in that business whether or not you chose to hedge a position in 
the futures market. While trading for myself I learned to take low risk 
high return trades; I do not try and capture every random move in the 
market. What I look for is what I like to call “Stress Free Trades” which to 
me are low risk e ntries that have high profit potential. I have enough 
stress in my life I don’t want trading to add to it.  
Order flow analysis is a visual representation of market price movements 
constructed by recording the volume traded on the bid and the offer as 
oppos ed to just looking solely at price. The value in order flow analysis is 
in instantly confirming market tops and bottoms when they form, 
determining where changes in supply and demand have occurred and 
providing insight into market psychology and market con ditions.  
Here is an Orderflows chart compared to a traditional candlestick chart:  
 

Page 4 of 150 
 
Normal bar charts only show the open, high, low and close. They don’t 
show how much traded on the bid and offer. They don’t measure how 
strong the buyers and sellers were. Orderflows charts tell you that.  
New traders  are always trying to find the Holy Gra il when it comes to 
trading. A way to trade that will allow them to pull money out of the 
market as if it is t heir own personal cash machine, a secret order to the 
markets based on price indicators and moving averages. However, 
when it comes to the market there are no secrets. Nothing in the market 
is 100% certain. Hard work, practice, sound money management and, 
most of all, discipline are what will make a trader profitable.  
Just as the alchemists used to try to turn lead into gold, mathematicians 
and com puter programmers come up with new indicators to try and 
predict the next market trend. Gann enthusiasts and Elliot Wave 
practitioners throw stones at me when I say the market is not ruled by 
mathematical formulas.  
Not much has changed over the last 100 ye ars of trading except the 
advent of computers making the dissemination of market information 
faster. Traders still look at the open, high, low, close and volume in 
almost the same fashion as they did 100 years ago. Traders still look at 
the ticker tape, al though now they refer to it as order flow.  Computers 
have made tracking the trades as they occur much easier and allows for 
the data to be analysed and deciphered.  
The Japanese have a saying “consult the market about the market” 
which means that when trading the market, we should pay close 
attention to the market movement is telling us , rather by swayed by 
information outside of the market, either fundamentally or technically.  In 
volatile times, a fundamental trader/analyst can be exactly right about 
the ma rket but they can get run over in the short run. A long term trader 
needs to be aware of what is happening in the market in the short term.  
It isn’t just the retail traders that get caught off side. Sometimes it is the 
big institutional hedge funds not wat ching what is happening in the 
market. In the case of Clive Capital, the fundamentals were still bullish, 
the technicals were something that rarely happens - the market moved 5 
standard deviations. None of that stopped the market.  
Page 5 of 150 
 
 
Would order flow analysis have helped Clive Capital? I don’t know. But I 
do know that when I see smoke I look for a fire and if there is a fire I run 
for the exit. I don’t wait around for the fire to be put out.  
I know what you are going to say, “Warren B uffet says to buy when 
everyone is selling and sell when everyone is buying.” You have to fade 
the crowd mentality. While that is indeed true most of the time, you have 
to get out when the signs are there. If you are an American visiting Iran 
and people ar e chanting “death to Americans” it is your best interest to 
get out there. Granted that is an ex treme example , but you should get 
the point. If the market is telling you to get out, you should get out.

Order flow is not another form of technical analysis  per se . Technical 
analysis is the study of prices as they appear on a price chart and it 
assumes that current prices represent all known information about the 
market. The problem with that is that traded prices don’t just represent 
intrinsic facts  about s upply and demand numbers, prices also take into 
account people’s expectations about the future . Order flow analysis is a 
dynamic, real -time way to view the market’s evolving and changing 
market state. Its primary benefit rests in its unique ability to see a clearly 
who is in control of the market based on market generated information 
as it happens.  
The key elements of order flow are price, traded bid volume, traded ask 
volume. When these elements are displayed in an order flow chart, 
traders who understand order flow will be able to identify the market’s 
areas of strength and weakness. Every market moves up or down based 
on the interaction between supply and demand. Traditional charting 
techniques or analysis do not accurately allow you to analyse, 
understan d and interpret the fighting  occurring between  supply and 
demand. Order flow charts allow you to dissect supply and demand 
balance in real time as it is happening. You will understand which side is 
in control and be prepared to respond when it changes.  
As we are taught in Economics 101, prices are a function of supply and 
demand, and both supply and demand are affected by people’s 
emotions.  Markets move based on people’s needs and more importantly 
their future expectations of needs. The problem is that a tr aditional  bar 
chart does not accurately measure nor reflect the emotions of the market 
participants.  
Order flow analysis allows a trader a quick read on changes in supply 
and demand . By analysing the price movements of the volume traded on 
the bid and ask, a trader is can confirm a trend continuation or reversal 
early on  and gauge market sentiment by determining how aggressive 
the market traded.  
In the past it was difficult to read an d understand order flow,  however  
advances in technology and the exchanges have made reading and 
following order flow accessible to anyone who is interested to learn it.  
Page 7 of 150 
 
The advantage of order flow analysis is that it shows the trader a very 
clear visual i mage of what is happening in the market. It provides a 
deeper insight into the market when compared to other types of charts. 
The market signals that show up in the order flow are not available in 
other forms of bar charts.  Now you can see and determine  for yourself  
how aggressive the buying or selling in a bar really is.  
It is a fact that institutional traders are the first to act when a big move is 
about to happen because they have the money to move the market  and 
they are often the traders that give the  market the push it needs to get 
started moving . In the past there used to be a trading floor where 
independent traders who paid big sums of money to be in the trading pit 
would yell and scream while trading with brokers who were executing 
the institutiona l trader’s orders. When a sizable order would go into the 
trading put the independent floor traders could make an educated guess 
if the order would move the market and trade accordingly. Today there 
are no trading pits. There are no people screaming to exe cute their 
trades in a trading pit where you can see which players are buying and 
selling. Trading is done electronically now. However, electronic trading is 
anonymous and quiet. You need to be able to read the footprints the 
institutional traders leave be hind in the market.   
Roughly 95% of traders lose money. Why? Losing traders make trading 
decisions based on indicators such as RSI, Stochastics, MACD, Moving 
Averages, etc. All these indicators are derived off of price. I find it is 
better to just look at price and how the market participants react to price. 
Price is an advertising mechanism. It is there to get you into a trade.  
Losing traders are your edge in the market. It is their money you have to 
take. In order to do that you have to approach and read the market in a 
way that is different than what the 95% of losing trader do.  
Many traders are led to believe that they can blindly follow a mechanical 
system that is based on a mathematical formula and back tested on 20 
years of data to show its profitabil ity. But what they fail to understand is 
that it is not mathematical formulas that move markets.  
You do not need an advanced degree in Applied Mathematics to 
understand and make efficient use of order flow. Even financial experts 
don’t know all the answers. Nobody does. Order flow analysis is a tool to 
Page 8 of 150 
 
help a trader make the right decisions, to spot w eak highs and lows, to 
spot aggressive buying and selling and much more.  
Other traders think they can just entrust their money to a “black box” 
computer program and sit back and make monthly withdrawals from 
their brokerage account. They think they can mak e the money 
successful traders do with an off the shelf computer program. They do 
not want to put in the hard work necessary to develop the skills to 
become a successful trader.  
A trader has to learn how to trade, not learn how to take a trade. What I 
mean is a trader has to learn how to read the market, learn how to 
anticipate what the market will do based on what it is telling you and go 
with it. If you talk to any aspiring trader they will tell you all about the 
latest indicator or moving average crosso ver they are using to trade. 
That is not trading, that is just taking a trade.  
So how does one 
make money trading? 
By listening to what 
the market is telling 
you and using 
strategies and taking 
trades that give you 
an edge by being 
more knowledgeable 
than most of the other 
traders. It is not as 
difficult as it looks.  
The key to 
successfully trading 
futures is to stack the 
deck in your favour. 
This is done by 
trading when you 
have an edge. Order 
flow gives you that 
edge. Most traders 
Page 9 of 150 
 
don’t pay attention to order flow. One of the benefits of order is that you 
don’t have to analyse every tick. Most numbers can be disregarded. 
What you are looking for are numbers that stick out and then ask 
yourself what is going on in the market.  
Be realistic in your thinking and approach to the market. At any given 
moment there are literally thousands if not tens of thousands of traders 
watching the market with the intention of finding a profitable trade to 
take. You don’t need a crystal ball to know when they are coming, you 
just have to get in before everyone else does.  
Time may prove me wrong, but I worry about the state of the markets 
when all the big trading firms only want to hire traders with advanced 
math degrees. It doesn’t take a PhD to understand why a market moves. 
I have always felt that trading is like most professions in as much as the 
accumulation of knowledge is concerned. Markets do not always do 
what they are supposed to do.  
Trading futures is a business just like any other. It is easy to be dazzled 
by the sto ries of the million dollar bonuses. Most people trade the 
markets for one reason – to make money. A successful trader has a 
business plan (trading plan – when to get in and out), a budget (trading 
capital), an operating plan (money management) and most imp ortantly 
has discipline and will use that discipline to stick to their plans and make 
money. They recognize when it just isn’t their day and stop trading for 
the day. They know when to be aggressive and when to back off. 
Tomorrow is another day. Futures ma rkets are open every weekday. 
Successful traders trade on their own terms and conditions. When the 
conditions are ripe they go in for the trade, if not they wait. Successful 
traders approach trading as a business like any professional would.  
We all want th e big money as a trader. When we watch basketball we all 
want the amount of money Michael Jordan made or what Lebron James 
makes now around $20 million a year. The fact is those guys are 
superstars and the best at their trade. Look at lesser players like R ay 
Allen who is Basketball’s All Time leading 3 point shooter. He earns $3 
million dollars a year. He comes on late in the game and shoots and 
score 3 point attempts. He specializes is one thing, but he does it 
Page 10 of 150 
 
extremely well. He has become a master at it.  Trading is the same way. 
Understand the basics and become a master in an aspect of trading.  
Every mother wants their child to grow up to be a doctor. Why? Because 
they know doctors make very good money. But I am sure among the 
doctors you know, the ones w ho make the most money are those who 
specialize in one area and are experts in their field of training, like the 
cardiologist or neurosurgeon. Some of the highest paid professionals are 
specialists. The point here is that in almost every field you can make  
good money by specializing in a certain area.  
Most people who are new to trading do not take the time to become 
experts in an area of trading. They jump from indicator to indicato r when 
they experience a loss. These new traders then think they know it al l 
when it comes to the market. But the fact is they don’t know much, their 
problem is they haven’t taken the time to learn about the market and 
what makes it move.  
Retail traders often place way too much emphasis on finding the 
absolute “perfect” system to  trade with the right balance of technical 
indicators. Professional traders make their trading decisions without 
relying on indicators and cluttered charts.  
Global political events, monetary policies, economic reports and other 
external fundamental forces are key factors in what drive price 
movements. These factors cannot be measured with an oscillator or a 
moving average. Knowing how to read the order flow, what is happening 
in the market, as these fundamental forces appear give you an  edge 
over other trad ers who are simply following indicators or oscillators 
which lag price.  
If I achieve my objective through this book, I will have taken you to a 
new level of understanding the market that most traders never think 
about or understand. As with any way of tra ding the markets one must 
proceed with baby steps when starting out. Make sure you understand 
what you are doing before jumping in as there are risks involved when 
you start trading with new ideas and concepts.  
Enough of this preaching, let’s get on to the  heart of the matter and 
begin to learn how to use order flow to become a profitable trader.

BENEFITS OF TRADING ORDER FLOW  
Order flow shows the market psychology. What is happening in the 
struggle between buyers and sellers.  There is no other form of analysis 
that shows you how aggressive traders are being in the market, among 
other things.  
Beginning traders often spend their time coming up with trading systems 
that show amazing win -loss ratios of 80% winning trades, profit r atios far 
exceeding $3 profit to every $1  loss and generating millions of dollars 
when back tested. So they open a trading account and promptly lose all 
their money. They think the markets are logical when in fact it is 
psychological. It is the emotions of  the market participants that dictate 
their buying and selling, not mathematical formulas. A market doesn’t 
reach a high and turn because the RSI say s the market is overbought, it 
turns because the sellers have overwhelmed the buyers or the buyers 
have dis appeared.  
Institutional traders make their money by being on the right side of the 
market when it moves. These traders work for banks, large corporations, 
hedge funds and governments. They can’t afford to be wrong on the 
market very often because it will u ltimately cost them their job and cushy 
lifestyle. At times these traders may be privy to information not readily 
available to the general trading public. These traders are able to see 
major trends before they take place and position themselves 
accordingly . They don’t rely on technical indicators and black box 
systems. They use the black box between their ears called their brain. 
What is great about order flow, is that their actions are recognizable in 
the volume after their trades. This enables the order f low trader to 
understand what is happening in the market before other traders are 
able to notice what is happening.  
Order flow h elps to remove the randomness from trade decisions. 
Traders who use technical indicators are basing their trading decisions 
on combinations of fast and slow moving averages. There is no logic 
behind it. Why should a 21 day moving average be that much better than 
a 20 day moving average? Technical indicators just curve fit past results 
to make the results  look pretty. We have all se en the charts showing a 
perfect MACD trade giving a buy signal at the low and sell signal at the 
high. But you don’t see the charts where you would be chopped up 
Page 12 of 150 
 
every other bar, buy, sell, buy, sell, buy, sell, etc. Order flow will help to 
keep you out of  the choppy markets.  
Order flow e nables a trader to make accurate trading decisions.  It is 
easy to make money when the market is trending beautifully in one 
direction. But the market doesn’t always do that. The market trends, 
stops, continues, turns direction, etc. Most technical tools  lag the current 
price. When market behaviour starts to change you need to quickly 
adapt. Order flow show s what is happening in the market NOW  so that 
you can capitalize on the opportunities as they happen . Order flows 
shows you why prices turned at a level. Order flow shows you how 
aggressive the market participants are.  
Order flow p rovides and objective means to quantify risk.  Every trading 
book says to “cut your losses short and let your winners run.” While 
great in th eory, the reality is when you cut your losses short, you also cut 
your potential profits. Technical and fundamental traders struggle to 
know when to cut losses short. There is no technical indicator that says 
you can cut a position short here or there. Order flow shows you exactly 
where to get out of a trade when it is not going as planned. You are not 
left to guess if a trade is working out or not. You will know before you get 
in. Additionally order flow shows you when there has been a change in 
supply and  demand which will help you determine if you should indeed 
cut your losses short.  
Order flow al lows for more structured and less stressful trading.  All 
traders look for low risk trades, but I take it a step further and look for 
low stress trades. We all  have enough stress in our life, there is no 
reason why trading should add to it. Order flow allows you to know the 
areas to get in and the area where you will know if a trade is not working 
out.

EXAMPLES OF ORDER FLOW  IN EVERYDAY LIFE  
Non-traders think tr ading futures is some black art that is only for those 
on the inside  and if you try to explain what order flow analysis is to them, 
they will think you are some sort of voodoo witch doctor . Actually we are 
all order flow traders in real life without realizing it. In our everyday life 
we are confronted with decisions about value of things, whether it is 
deciding to fill up your car with gasoline at Shell or Texaco based on 
price or reading about a sale for the latest hand phone. We make 
decisions based  on based on our perceived value of a product relative to 
what we are willing to pay for it and how desperately we need it.  
When you buy a car you go to a car dealer with an idea of what the car 
you want to buy is worth and what you are willing to pay for it. The 
dealer knows what the lowest price is that he can sell it at. You and the 
dealer negotiate back and forth until both of you are happy and agree on 
a price. Within the negotiation one of you had to be the initiator in the 
trade. Either the dealer ca me down to the price you wanted to pay or 
you went up to paid the price the dealer was offering to sell the car to 
you.  
Women don’t realize but they are on the forefront beneficiaries of trading 
and market forces because the fashion business operates just  like the 
market. Trends in fashion are constantly changing, skirts get shorter, 
certain fabrics become more popular as do colours.  Clothing stores 
watch their inventory and anticipate changes in fashion trends to make 
sure they are adequately stocked wit h items where there is strong 
demand and they can charge high prices. The stores lower prices on 
items when the demand is waning and they can still make a profit on it. If 
a store does not change its position quickly enough and go down on 
price on items wi th dying demand they will be forced to sell those items 
at a loss.  
Your body temperature fluctuates during the day, most of the time your 
temperature is within a normal range of 36 to 37 degrees Celsius. Body 
temperature tends to be at its lowest during th e morning and it is at its 
highest during the afternoon. Many outside factors such as exercise, 
eating, consuming alcohol or catching a virus can cause your 
temperature to rise outside its normal range. If it reaches a certain level 
and stays there for a p rolonged period you know you are not healthy. 
Page 14 of 150 
 
The markets are the same way, only instead of temperature you are 
dealing with prices. If a price is too extreme it can be a sign of the 
market being unhealthy. When external factors are added to the normal 
routine, the market can and will react to it, just like your body 
temperature.  
It doesn’t always rain when the sky is cloudy. Nor does a bright shining 
sun indicate warm weather. Weather predictions depend on such factors 
as the time of year, high and low pr essure areas, barometer readings, 
etc. The markets behave the same way. Just because a chart indicates 
something  should happen  doesn’t mean it will happen. Just because 
fundamental analysis leads you to believe prices should go up that they 
will. You need to look at what is actually happening in the market to 
know what is happening in the market.

ORDERFLOWS SOFTWARE  
There are several different order flow software vendors in the market. I 
tried most of them. The prices range from a few hundred dollars to w ell 
over $3000! The scary part is people actually spend $3000 and more for 
trading software thinking it will make them a better trader. It is tempting 
when you see their slick sales pitch. I mean who wouldn’t want to trade 2 
hours a day and make $1000? If you could guarantee me $1000 a day 
profit trading for only 2 hours a day, sign me up. Unfortunately there are 
no guarantees in trading and it takes work, sometimes a lot of work.  
I created the Orderflows software so that reading and understanding 
order flo w is easier based on what I feel is important to the trader. I 
spent the better part of three decades trading all different sizes  of 
orders . I traded more than my share of thousand lot orders. I know the 
impact certain types of orders and trades have on th e market. I know 
what it is like to trapped in a position and need to scramble to get out. I 
know what  will happen to the market  when I step in with 1500 lots to buy 
and create a low of the day.  There are a lot of market intricacies that the 
current order flow software just did not highlight or explain. I found a 
coder and gave him my instructions and the result is the Orderflows 
software.  
When creating the Orderflows Trader software I want ed the indicators to 
be displayed automatically on the chart. The be auty of order flow 
analysis is that it can be applied to any timeframe, range -frame or 
volume -frame with consistent results.  
Orderflows Trader software can be used on its own or in conjunction 
with whatever method you use to analyse the market and make tra ding 
decisions.  
I purposely  wanted to keep  the chart clean and uncluttered so that it is 
easy to see setups as they are happening.  The only squiggly line on my 
chart is the high and low for session.  
Page 16 of 150 
 
 
The Orderflows software runs on the Ninja Trader  trading platform. I 
chose this platform because for a retail trader it is probably the best 
trading platform available. Many futures brokers use Ni njaTrader 
software. Ninja Trader offers a free version. You can run the Orderflows 
software on a free version  of Ninja Trader if you want  to and execute 
your trades through your own broker supplied trading front end.   
I get my data from Kinetick. The quality is excellent and the price is 
affordable.

INTERPRETING ORDER FLOW  
When an institutional participant , like a hedge fund,  wants to buy 2 500 
contracts of soybeans, they won’t just put in a market order to buy 2 500 
contracts at the market . They have to think of the market impact an 
order of that size could cause. There are many ways they can work the 
order to minimize market impact, but the fact remains the same. When 
the trades go through it will show up in the tape and can be interpreted  
in the order flow.  
Order flow’s value is not in predicting exact tops or bottoms, but in 
confirming market tops or bottoms as they form and providing insight 
into the market’s psychology.  
At the most basic level of market structure it is buyers (demand) a nd 
sellers (supply) who move the markets. It is not mathematical formulas. 
Markets don’t move because the MACD or RSI reached a 
predetermined level. What causes markets to move is when demand 
exceeds supply or supply overwhelms demand. Indicators lag price s. 
When the market makes a high, there are no indicators which will say 
sell until well after the market has turned lower.  
What causes markets to turn and change direction is a litt le more 
complex. M arkets turn when the last buyer has bought or the last se ller 
has sold. M arkets turn when there price is considered cheap and big 
buyers start to come in and scoop up supply at those low price levels. 
Conversely, when prices are rich and sellers want to sell as much as 
they can high prices.  There are times it is  just obvious you would not 
believe it. Order flow charts show you these levels.  
I use order flow to understand the behaviour of the market. Everything I 
do is to understand the behaviour of other market participants. I try to 
understand the position the o ther trader is in. Are they long and wrong? 
Has a big player decided price is too cheap or expensive? Has someone 
tried to push prices higher or lower and failed? All of these questions 
and more can be answered with order flow. Imbalances in supply and 
demand can be detected with volume analysis.  
Once you start watching the way orders flow into the market by reading 
the tracks or footprints  left behind  by the traders  it will become clear er 
where the market is going. Markets are not predictable all the time,  but 
Page 18 of 150 
 
at certain times the direction the market will be moving will become 
pretty obvious.  
Order flow is a discretionary way to trade. Even though it requires 
discretion, it doesn’t mean that you trade it without rules. Every situation 
is a bit different. W hat you look for are patterns that occur over and over. 
They may not be exactly the same, but the pattern of the order flow is 
recognizable. Are aggressive buyers coming in? Is a high weak? Etc.  
Order flow allows you to identify price action that repeats i n a general 
sense. How the order flow flows in the market. While the market activity 
is never exactly repeated, by knowing how to read the market activity as 
it happens enables the trader to gauge the current state of the market 
and form an opinion of what  will happen. There is always a constant 
struggle between buyers and sellers. Buyers want the price to go higher 
and sellers want the price to go lower. So you need to ask yourself “who 
is in control?” The market is always giving clues as to who is in cont rol. 
By observing the flow of trade can a trader understand who is in control 
of the market.  
I spent three decades  watching and trading futures based on order flow. 
The same concepts still apply from 20 years ago or even 100 years ago 
as they do today. Wh en the price of something is too cheap people buy 
it and it becomes a low. When the price is too high, people sell it and the 
high is made.  
What order flow provides the trader is the ability to stay out of the market 
when there is no reason to trade. It al lows the trader to see both sides of 
the market, what is trading on the bid and what is trading on the offer, 
and gives the trader a far better view of the current state of supply and 
demand than the ordinary trader will struggle to see.  
I have met a lot o f floor traders in my life and some of the best have told 
me they get a “feel” for the market. While this may have been true during 
the days of open outcry because you can see and hear the trading going 
on based on the noise level and hand signals flashing  back and forth. 
Unfortunately now the open outcry trading floors are closed and 
everything is traded electronically. It is hard to get that “feel” on the 
market anymore. Even when I think about it, having a “feeling” on the 
market has gotten me into more trouble than I care to mention.  
Page 19 of 150 
 
However I believe that anyone can learn to “read” the market. Reading 
the market allows you to know where buying and selling is going on or 
drying up. Reading the market allows you to know where solid highs and 
lows have bee n made.  
Traders make money by being positioned in the direction the market is 
moving. They are long when the market is going up. They are short 
when the market is going down. It sounds simple, yet so many people 
lose money in the market because they are sh ort when the market is 
going up or long when the market is going down. By reading the order 
flow a trader can determine the direction of the market. If the market tells 
you to go long, then buy and go long, and when it starts to go down, 
then get out of th e position or get short.  
Let the market show you the direction it wants to go rather than trying to 
predict where the market will go.  
Order flow charts can be used in any futures market that has sufficient 
volume traded daily. There are different strategi es to employ for different 
market conditions. Markets that have high price volatility (have large 
price ranges) with varying volume, i.e. currency futures, have certain 
characteristics that are inherent to them, while markets that have low 
price volatility  but high volume, i.e. interest rate futures, have their own 
characteristics. However many of the same underlying principles 
discussed here can be applied to both types of markets.

READING AN ORDER FLOW CHART  
 
When comparing prices on an order flow chart you have to do it 
diagonally  from the left to up on level on the right , not horizontally . 
Futures markets no longer  trade in a fixing in that they when it gets to a 
price like 1.1244  all the people that want to buy it  and sell it  at that price  
can. The way the markets work is traders put in bids and offers and 
people buy and sell accordingly. The market will move from 1.1240  bid / 
1.1241  offer to 1.1241  bid / 1.1242  offer to 1.1242 bid /1.1243  offer.  
When you look at the example above , when the market was 1.1240  bid / 
offered at 1.1241 . 9 lots were sold into the bid and 94 lots were bought 
from the offer. When the market was 1.1241  bid / offered at 1.1242 , 38 
lots were sold into the bid and 29 lots were bought from the offer. When 
the market was 1.1242  bid / 1.1243  offer, 67 lots were sold into the bid 
and 57 lots bought from the offer. When the market was 1.1243  bid / 
1.1244  offer, 86 lots were sold into the bid and 80 lots bought from the 
offer at 1.1244 . When the market was 1.1244 bi d / 1.1245 offer, 85 lots 
were sold in the bid and 100 lots bought from the offer. When the market 

Page 21 of 150 
 
was 1.1245 bid/1.1246 offer, 53 lots were sold into the bid and 53 lots 
were bought from the offer. When the market was 1.1246 bid/1.1247 
offer, 37 lots were  sold into the bid and 13 lots bought from the offer.  
The market did not go 1.1247  bid because the volume on the bid is 17. 
This is called unfinished business. The market tried to go higher and 
was bid 1.1247 and in this case 17 lots sold into it, but no one bought 
from the offer at 1.1248. The reason this is referred to as unfinished 
business is because the market has a tendency to come back to that 
level.  
The market did not go 1.1240  offer because the offer volume is 0.  If the 
market went offered at 1.12 40 and traded it would show a volume other 
than 0.  
There is alway s a bid and offer in the market (unless the market is limit 
big or limit offer).  That is how trading is done. Someone wants to buy so 
they work a bid, someone wants to sell so they work and o ffer. When 
someone is tired of waiting they go to the market on their order or they 
just get in at the market . They buy at the offer price or they sell at the bi d 
price. Order flow charts allow you to compare what traded on the bid 
side and what traded on the offer side.  
Order flow charts monitor not just volume and price, but more 
importantly on which side of the market the volume happened. The bid 
side or the offer side. It is this information that gives the order flow 
footprint charts their color  – green for aggressive buying (more trading at 
the offer price) and red for aggressive selling (more trading at the bid 
price). Black prices are considered neutral.  
On the next couple of pages is a quick glance at Orderflows Trader 
software generated char ts. Don’t worry about understanding all the 
notations now. It will make sense to you once you read through this 
guide.

THE IMPORTANCE OF PRICE  
Price is one of the most important pieces of information in trading. Price 
is what makes people want to buy or sell  a commodity . The change  in 
the price of a commodity is  the determining factor between  a profit or a 
loss for traders .  
The goal for traders is to buy when the price is low and sell when it is 
high. That is common sense, Trading 101. So why do s o many people 
lose money trading?  
When the price of a commodity starts to move there needs to be a big 
enough force behind it to overcome its opposing force. Stated another 
way, there has to be more buyers than sellers for the price to move up or 
more sel lers than buyers for price to move down. The market 
participants cause the market to move with their buying or selling 
activities.  
HOW  price moves out of a n area  can determine if the impending move 
will be  strong or weak.  Just because priced moved does no t mean it will 
continue in that direction. Knowing HOW priced moved is important in 
understanding the health of the 
market, if it is strong or weak.  
How often have you seen price 
action on a chart like the one on the 
right?  
It is easy to look at a chart an d see a 
long down  bar and t hink “everyone is 
selling .” Do you want to sell also? 
The market can continue down, you 
see it all the time in the market. 
However, i t is not uncommon for a 
long bearish down  bar on a chart to 
be immediately followed by a long 
bullish up  bar. But until you look at 
the next component, volume, you 
can’t judge how strong the move is 
and more impo rtantly who is behind the move.  
Page 25 of 150 
 
Here you have a big down candle , followed by a big up candle, followed 
by a big down candle again. When you look at the first big down candle 
you say sellers are in control, which is not wrong but if the sellers are in 
control why did the market turn around so fast? It just did a complete 
180 degree turn and even took out the high of the red down bar.  
When you l ook at an order flow chart you have a better understanding of 
why the market turned around so fast at point A due to massive passive 
buying  and why that when the market subsequently tried to sell off again 
it met support around 368.50  to 369.50 level  at po int B (previous level of 
aggressive buying imbalance) . Market rotations  like this  happen quite 
regularly  as you will see throughout this book.  
 
Markets move because of the changes in supply and demand. We all 
know that. When there is more buying than sell ing, prices go up. When 
there is more selling than buying, prices go down. While it sounds simple  

Page 26 of 150 
 
that is the textbook theory , but it is actually a little more complex than 
that. 
Markets move up because there are no major sellers taking profits yet. 
The ma jor buying should have already occurred early in the move by 
institutions. So until institutions start selling their positions out, the 
market keeps going higher. If institutional players are still expecting 
higher prices they will absorb selling that come s into the market. But 
they won’t be buying just to support the market, they are buying until 
they are sure all the supply at these lower  levels has disappeared.  
Markets may move down not just because there are more sellers than 
buyers. It could very well be that there is just not enough buying to 
support the market on its way down. In a down market there is very little 
to hold up the market in terms of bids, as a result prices drop. This is 
one of the reasons markets drop much faster than they go up.  
When the market is moving the best trades are to buy when buyers are 
buying and sell when the sellers are selling. In the days of pit trading, 
locals used to stand in the pit all day and could see when the institutional 
money would come into the market to move it. They locals joined in on 
the moves. This is not rocket science. The trading pits were filled with 
guys with only high school degrees or even college degrees. It doesn’t 
take a PhD to know that when the market is moving is a good idea to 
move in the sam e direction.  
Prices go up until:  
1. Buyers become unwilling to buy.  
2. Buyers run out of buying power.  
3. Buyers are overwhelmed by sellers.  
Prices go down until:  
1. Sellers become unwilling to sell.  
2. Sellers run out of inventory.  
3. Sellers are overwhelmed by buyers.  
A trader needs to be able to understand what kind of activity is moving 
prices. If sellers are pounding into bids and clearing them out, your 
position can get run over pretty fast, especially depending on who else is 
Page 27 of 150 
 
there selling. You have to determine if  it is better to be a buyer in a 
market going down or a seller.  
Only an order flow chart can give a trader the insight into why the market 
turned around. Not all market turns will be as clear cut as the example 
above. But when they are you need to be able to react quickly to take 
advantage of the opportunity.  
  
Page 28 of 150 
 
THE IMPORTANCE OF VOLUME  
Volume is also an  important part of a trader’s arsenal but also is perhaps 
one of the least understood. Until now most analysis of volume has been 
on total volume . Order flow breaks down volume by the amount traded 
on the bid side and the amount traded on the offer side. Now traders can 
determine if the buyers were aggressive or passive and if the sellers 
were aggressive or passive.  Price and volume loo ked at togeth er will 
help the trader  determine the current state of the market and if supply 
and demand is imbalanced.  
Traditionally volume has been looked and analysed after the fact, not as 
it is happening.  Generally volume  would be plotte d along the bottom and 
would  be used to confirm a trend. Technical analysts will tell you that 
volume is a measure of the strength of the current price trend.  
 
The problem that I always had when looking at volume in this simplistic, 
already rudimentary way was that you couldn’t diff erentiate between 
volumes traded on the bid versus volume traded on the offer. This is 

Page 29 of 150 
 
especially important on bars that look neutral, where the opened and 
closed at about the same level . 
If you look at volume by itself, its meaning has little value  becaus e you 
don’t know where price is  relative to the amount of volume traded . Once 
you start to look at volume relative to price you begin to understand the 
momentum within the market. Volume is perhaps the most important 
piece of information when determining the strength of a trend. Markets 
move up, down and sideways over time and price.  
In an up trend, traded volume should be increasing on the offer side. This 
shows that buyers are bei ng aggressive and buying all the available 
supply the market has to offer.  
In a down trend, traded volume should be increasing on the bid sid e. 
This shows that sellers are getting rid of their supply to passive buyers.  
In a sideways trading market  the volu me on both the bids and offers 
should be absorbed by the marketplace like a sponge.  
Order flow v olume  analysis  tells us the amount traded at a price during a 
time frame. When you start to look at the volume that has traded at 
subsequent prices you can dete rmine if the market is strong or weak.  
Traditional charting methods only measure volume in regards to time. If 
you look at volume traded at price you get a much clearer picture of 
what is going on in the market.  
Page 30 of 150 
 
 
When you look at point A, the internal vol ume trading in that bar 
screams at you that the buying is done. There is a big buying imbalance 
at the high 235 and 188 lots over the 2 time periods at 1.0987 and 278 
lots buying imbalance at 1.0986 , then the market sold off and there is 
200 lots selling imbalance  traded on the bid at 1.0982 . A stacked 
imbalance of 3 levels of selling imbalances between 1.0980 and 1.0978.  
A few more selling imbalances appear in that bar. The market tried to 
rally on the next couple of bars but could not get past the stacke d selling 
imbalance, before finally selling off dramatically. It is pretty amazing how 
stacked imbalances act as great levels for the market bounce off of. 
They are great areas for low risk entries.  
Generally speaking when volume is low and the market is m oving up, 
you know that the market is weak. This could be because the 
institutional participants are not buying in the up move because they 
know that higher prices cannot be sustained based on supply and 

Page 31 of 150 
 
demand. Unless the institutions are participating in  the up move, it 
probably won’t last very long.  If it is just retail money moving the market 
with little volume, that is not a good sign.  
For a trend to be down there would need to be institutional participation 
which would show up in the volume . There is ample supply  in the 
market , so there will be strong volume on the move down  as the sellers 
will be offloading their supply to buyers . During down trends you will see 
small, temporary up moves within the down trend. Watch the move and 
check the volume. Inst itutions have been bearish the markets and 
selling, you won’t see them buying into a weak market just because 
price bounced a little bit. When you notice the volume start to diminish 
on a down trend the selling pressure by institutions is subsiding. While 
the market may continue to fall be aware that it could quickly turn and 
rise momentarily due to lack of supply.  For a market to turn from a 
downtrend to an uptrend, buyers would need to come in and take control 
from the sellers which usually equates to a r ise in volume.  
  
Page 32 of 150 
 
THE IMPORTANCE OF DELTA  
Delta is a term used by order flow traders to define the net buying or 
selling that took place for a given bar. It is calculated by using tick data 
and seeing who initiated the trade, either the buyer or seller. If more 
sellers initiated the trade, then the delta is considered negative. If more 
buyers initiated the trade, then the delta is considered positive.  
The reason delta is important is because you can determine the strength 
of a trend based on volume. As price  trends higher you would want to 
see positive delta which is a sign of buying driving the price. The 
opposite would be true for a market trading lower, there should be 
sellers driving the price which would translate into negative delta.  
Visually, delta measurements look like this:  
 
Delta – delta for the bar  
Max. Delta  – Maximum delta in the bar  
Min. Delta  – Minimum delta in the bar  

Page 33 of 150 
 
Cum . Delta  – Cumulative delta of the day  
Cum . Delta/Volume  – Cumulative delta divided by volume  
Volume  – Volume for the bar  
Cum . Volume  – Cumulative volume for the day  
 
If a market is consolidating  or range trading, the delta  number generally 
will be a low number, depending on the market it could be less than 100 
when normally it is over 1000,  and will bounce around back and forth 
between positive and negative.  
There will be times when the delta is very close to zero which is a sign 
that there is an almost equal amount of volume trading on both sides of 
the market. This is called absorption and is usually a place where supply 
and demand can shi ft and a new trend start.  
Delta is also relative to the type of chart and what part of the trading day 
you are looking at. If you have a 1 minute chart up, the delta can be very 
low just because there might no t be much trading going on. The same 
can be said if you are trading in the evening or early morning sessions, 
before the old regular trading hours start. Those times of the day 
generally have little volume trading so delta will be small.  
If you are looking  at a 10000 volume E -mini SP chart and the bar has a 
delta of 100, that would be more important than a 5 minutes chart where 
the total volume traded was 1500 lots and the delta was 100. You have 
to take the delta in context to what kind of chart you are us ing.

COT – COMMITMENT OF TRADERS  
I am not talking about the Commitment Of Traders report put out by the 
CFTC which is a breakdown of open interest in futures markets. That 
report has its own uses not covered here.  
With order flow analysis footprint char ts, each price bar has a COT or 
Commitment Of Traders in it. This is the price level within a bar that the 
most traded volume occurred on both sides, where the most trade was 
committed within the bar. Remember order flow analysis looks within the 
bar. With  a regular bar chart or candlestick chart there is no way of 
knowing this.  
 
The Orderflows Trader software package will put a box aroun d the COT 
for easy visualization on your chart.  

Page 35 of 150 
 
With the COT you can see where the most volume occurred, whether it 
was near the top, middle or bottom.  
The COT is important because it gives you clues as to what the market 
forces were up to within the bar. It can tell you within the bar where 
demand has overcome supply and vice versa as one side will be 
dominant.  
The COT t ells you something that traditional bar or candlestick charts 
cannot.  Depending on where the COT is you can get a quick glimpse 
where the most activity was which in turn can give you hint to anything 
out of the ordinary.  
 
In the above chart, the COT occurred near the low of the bar which 
closed on near its high. When the most volume trades near the low of a 
bar that closed higher, it is usually a sign that there are strong passive 

Page 36 of 150 
 
buyers. In this case we see strong passive buying as well as buyers 
willing to buy all the supply other sellers were offering.  
 
In the above example, at point A, the COT occurred near the top of the 
bar and the bar closed lower. This tells me that there were interested 
buyers near the high, but they were met with just as many interested 
sellers and the sellers took control of the market and moved it lower.  
At point B. The market tried to rally and lost steam as the buyers just 
dried up as evidenced by only 1 lot trading at the high, then a sellin g 
imbalance  just below the high of the bar and the market sold off and 
closed on its low. The COT appears near the bottom of the bar and there 
is a big buyer that was aggressively sold into causing a selling 
imbalance.  Just above the COT there is also a b ig number on the bid 
that was sold into, the market participants just ate through the bids and 

Page 37 of 150 
 
closed on the low of the bar. Also there was not much buying in the bar. 
When I see the COT near or at the bottom of a bar that closed on its 
lows that is usuall y a sign or the market going lower since there were 
active sellers to move prices lower.  
Generally speaking when the COT is in the middle of a bar, it is market 
neutral. If it appears at the top of a bar and the bar closed lower that is a 
bearish sign as a lot of trade was facilitated at the high but the market 
couldn’t trade higher, all the buyers were met big sellers. If the COT 
appears at the bottom of the bar and the bar closed higher, it is generally 
a bullish sign as all the selling pressure was met with buyers. There are 
many different combinations  of COT locations . 
 
In the example above, the market is just sort of going nowhere.  It would 
go up a couple of points then come down a couple of points. The COT’s 
are appearing mostly in the middle of the  bars. Then at point A, all of a 

Page 38 of 150 
 
sudden there are some big new passive sellers that put in offers at the 
1984.00 and 1984.25 level which were bought up but the market couldn’t 
go higher and actually closed lower and there were a few selling 
imbalances near  the low of the bar. The COT is near the top of the bar, 
yet the bar closed lower. This is my clue that the market is primed to go 
lower which it does.  
The COT by itself is not an indicator, but can be used for confirmation of 
a move. I like to look at the  COT location in a bar when I am lost on the 
direction of the market. If the market is just range trading I look to the 
COT for some sort of sign as to the direction or potential direction.

DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUYERS AND SELLERS  
Every book on futures trad ing says that the market is a zero sum game. 
For every winner there is a loser. This is true, but not everyone trades 
futures for the same reasons.  
It is a common belief that everyone is trading the futures market to make 
a profit. That is not always the case , even though the overwhelming 
majority of trading is done to make profits.  Futures trades could be put 
on as a hedge. When someone is long an underlying  commodity , they 
sell the futures  to hedge  their price risk . Farmers have been doing this 
for centuries  as a form of insurance. If the futures position loses money, 
they don’t worry so much. Just like with life insurance, you don’t feel bad 
when you don’t die and your family can’t claim the money.   
There are many other reasons people enter into trades in the futures 
markets which are not for the sole purpose of making money in and of 
itself or without directional bias. A trade can be part of a statistical arb 
trade where a trader is long/short diff erent markets trying to take 
advantage of miniscule pricing differences. A trade can be part of a 
spread between correlated markets. There are many reasons too 
numerous to mention in this book alone. But each reason helps to 
explain why a market can facili tate trade on both the bid and offer and 
not move much.  
So as you can see there are several different types of buyers and 
sellers. Being able to distinguish between them will help you understand 
what the market is showing you as to its direction.  
What doe s it mean when there is an aggressive buyer? It means that 
someone bought the offer. They paid the market price to get into our out 
of a position.  
What does it mean when there is an aggressive seller? It means that 
someone sold into the bid. They sold at t he market to get into or out of a 
position.  
What does it mean when there are passive buyers? It means they 
bought at the bid price. An aggressive seller sold it to them.  
What does it mean when there are passive sellers? It means they sold at 
the offer pric e. An aggressive buyer bought from them.  
Page 40 of 150 
 
Generally I find that aggressive buyers and sellers are those who need 
to get into a position. We may not know the reason these participants 
are getting into the position so aggressively, but when they are it leads 
to imbalances which is a sign of a market getting ready to move.  
Passive buyers and sellers are less aggressive, but just as important. 
They provide support and resistance to the market place. They are the 
buyers at the low and sellers at the high. When a market cannot get past 
a big passive buyer that is a signal the market can be ready to turn.  
  
Page 41 of 150 
 
AGGRESSIVE PARTICIPANTS  
In the old days when a market would move without a clear reason, 
brokers would say “there are more buyers than sellers” or vice versa. 
However the problem with that is that it is just not true. There are not 
more buyers or sellers. What you have is different types of buyers and 
sellers. There are aggressive buyers and sellers and there are passive 
buyers and sellers.  Every bar is made up of  both aggressive buyers and 
sellers as well as passive buyers and sellers.  
Throughout this book you will see the words “aggressive buyers” and 
“aggressive sellers.” When a trader is being aggressive they are hitting 
the bid or lifting the offer. They are e ssentially paying the market price to 
get into the market. Aggressive participants trade into passive 
participants resting limit orders.  
Aggressive buyers and sellers are represented by selling at the bid or 
buying at the offer. They are willing to sell o r buy at the market price 
because they want out of they want in.  
An aggressive buyer is someone who is will to pay what the seller is 
asking. An aggressive seller is someone who is willing to sell at a price 
the buyer is bidding.  
 

Page 42 of 150 
 
When you see big aggressive buyers or sellers come in to the market, 
you should watch what the market does afterwards. Does the market 
rally? Does it sell off? Does it hesitate? Does it get absorbed? When 
there are big aggressive buyers the market will typically rally. Whe n 
there are big aggressive sellers the market will typically sell off.  If the 
market does not do what it is supposed to do, the contrary move is likely 
to be magnified.  
 
It is easy to confuse aggressive buying and selling with buying and 
selling imbalanc es. The difference is for every trade there is either an 
aggressive buyer and passive seller or an aggressive seller and passive 
buyer, one participant will be aggressive and one will be passive; a 
buying or selling imbalance doesn’t have to happen. An imb alance 
occurs when the buying/selling ratio is above a certain level. There is a 
whole section devoted to buying and selling imbalances in this book.  

Page 43 of 150 
 
 
By itself just looking at aggressive participants and trying to determine 
market direction is a bit difficult because in every trade there is an 
aggressive participant and a passive participant. You have to take the 
information in context to the rest of th e market.  
Of course every buyer has to be met by a seller and that is the subject of 
the next chapter – passive participants.  
  

Page 44 of 150 
 
PASSIVE PARTICIPANTS  
Passive participants are those who are willing to sit on the bid or sit on 
the offer to get into a trade.  They are not moving their price to get into 
the market. They have decided that at a particular level they want to buy 
or sell and are willing to sit there until they get filled. Passive participants 
will enter the market on limit orders. Aggressive partic ipants will trade 
into passive participants limit orders.  
 
Passive buyers and sellers are represented by limit orders. They let the 
market come to them.  So in the above picture at 1.1244 , 85 lots were 
bought by passive buyers, people just sitting on the b id. 80 lots were 
sold by passive sellers, it was bought by aggressive buyers. At 1.1243, 
86 lots were bought by passive buyers, the people that sold it to them 
were aggressive sellers, because they had to go down in price to meet 
the bid price;  57 lots we re sold by passive sellers at 1.1243, sellers who 
were working an offer at 1.1243.  
A passive buyer is someone who is willing to buy at his bid price. A 
passive seller is some who is willing to sell at his offer price.  

Page 45 of 150 
 
In other words, when you look at the market quote:  
 
393.50 bid / 393.75 offer  
393.50 bid for 500 contracts / 393.75 offer for 200 contracts  
The 500 contracts on the bid are passive buyers  
The 200 contracts  on the offer are passive sellers  
 
If someone one is working a bid for 10 contracts at 393.50 and decides 
to just go ahead and buy his 10 contracts at the market price of 393.75 
he is now consider an aggressive buyer. The opposite is true if a seller 
working an offer at 393.75 decides to sell at the market price of 393.50, 
he has become an a ggressive seller.  
While most traders like watch what the aggressive participants are 
doing, keeping an eye on the passive participants can be extremely 
profitable as their levels can often times signify major turning points in 
the market. Passive participa nts are usually institutions who can help set 
the price highs or lows. When price gets too cheap they step in and buy 
everything. When price gets too high they sell as much as they can. 
When you see huge numbers that traded on the bid side at a low or 
huge  numbers traded on the offer side on a high these are usually good 
indications of institutions passive participants.  
I like to see big passive participants at highs and lows rather than in the 
middle of a move.

THE IMPORTANCE OF AGGRESSIVE AND PASSIVE PARTICPANTS  
When the market starts to move, it takes market orders to push the price 
higher or lower. Limit orders don’t move the market. For the market to go 
up traders have to buy at subsequently higher prices. For the market to 
go lower traders have to sell at lower prices. The market has to work 
through levels of passive buyers or sellers.  
Every trader knows that certain price levels are important in terms of 
supply and demand. By seeing the volume that traded at that particular 
level and even how the market reacted around the level, a trader can 
determine if the level will hold or not.  
Many trading “gurus” teach that declining volume always precedes a 
market top or market bottom  as if it is an immutable law . In school book 
theory yes it may be true, but in reality it is not always true as evidenced 
in the order flow chart.  You can have heavy selling at market bottoms 
and market tops , almost as if the market hits a wall and turns around in 
the opposite direction .  
 

Page 48 of 150 
 
Think of these levels as lines  in the sand. You do not want to cross that 
level without good reason or else you will find yourself in trouble.  
A trade looks more appealing if there is a big volume number that 
supported the market than just an average number. These trades don’t 
happen every day but when they do they are pretty reliable indications of 
market bias, at least in the short term.  
  

Page 49 of 150 
 
IMBALANCE LEVELS  
The volume traded at a price level in the market can either be balanced 
or imbalanced. When a level is out of balance there are proportionally 
more buyers or sellers at that level. Most commonly used ratios are 
250%, 300% and 400%.  
What does it mean when there is a buying imbalance? It means that the 
quantity bought on the offer is greater than a set ratio than the amount 
traded o n the bid, usually 250% (2.5 -1), 300% (3 -1) or 400% (4 -1). It 
may not be just one buyer, it can be several, but what is important is the 
traded quantity is greater on the offer than the bid.  
What does it mean when there is a selling imbalance? It means tha t the 
quantity sold on the bid is greater than a set ratio than the amount 
traded on the offer, usually 250% (2.5 -1), 300% (3 -1) or 400% (4 -1).. It 
may not be just one seller, it can be several, but what is important is the 
traded quantity is greater on th e bid than the offer.  
Here is what imbalance levels look like on an Orderflows  chart:  
 

Page 50 of 150 
 
 
When an imbalance happens  in supply and demand that is where 
trading opportunities appear. When big buyers come in and the market 
can’t rotate up then look for a change in bias. The opposite is true when 
big sellers come in and the market can’t sell off, be on the lookout for a 
change in bias.  
The beginning s of a trend as well as ends of a trend are  often marked 
with market imbalances caused by aggressive participants. This shows 
that participants are anxious to get in the market and large volume 
enters the market and prices move q uickly.  
 
  

Page 51 of 150 
 
STACKED IMBALANCE  
Stack ed imbalances are important levels to look for when initiating a 
position. When you get stacked imbalances of 3 or more on top of one 
another it is a good sign of strong pressure in the market and that the 
market will con tinue in that direction.  It acts as support and resistance.  
 
The reason s tacked imbalances are good levels  of support and 
resistance as they are levels where the market was aggressive ly sold 
into a bid or  an offer was  aggressively bought into. In theory these 
stacked imbalance levels are levels where participants aggressively 
wanted to get into the market, so when the market retests those levels, 
the same participants may appear again.  

Page 52 of 150 
 
The beauty of stacked imbalances is that they make great entries for low 
risk trades. Quite often price will retrace back into a stack imbalance 
zone before continuing in the direction of the stacked imbalance. The 
stop placement is very easy, it is just outsid e of the stacked imbalance 
zone, literally a tick or two outside the stacked imbalance.  
 
At point A  there was a stacked selling imbalance and  the market sold off 
from the middle of the imbalance zone before rallying through it.  At point 
B, there was a stacked buying imbalance, the market traded down 
through it before rallying back up where it hit point C, and could not get 
past that level and then turned and sold off. Depending on where you 
put your limit order to get in the pos ition, I like to put my entry limit order 
at the middle and last price in the stacked imbalance zone then I place 
my stop one and two ticks outside the stacked imbalance zone. This 
trade has an average 1.5 tick stop. A small loss at point A and point B, 

Page 53 of 150 
 
but point C was a nice winner. The market sold off 50 points to 1.0930 , 
not bad considering your entry was at 1.0979 and 1.0980.  
During the course of the trading day there can be many stacked 
imbalances. There will be some that work out beautifully, but most  will 
fail. But for a trade where you are risking 1 tick to 2 ticks with a potential 
profit of 10ticks, 20 ticks and more it is worth the trade. I like to look for 
these trades on longer time frame charts like a 15 minute or 30 minute 
chart.  
 

Page 54 of 150 
 
Orderflows s oftware has a feature that will find stacked imbalances in a 
market and draw on your chart the support and resistance levels 
generated by the market.  For buying imbalances a green zone will be 
shown on your chart. For selling imbalances a red zone will be shown on 
your chart.

TRAPPED  BUYERS AND SELLERS  
Trapped buyers and sellers are short term market participants that 
bought at or near the high or sold at or near the low and the market has 
not followed through for them, they are trapped in a losing position , the 
market has turned against them and they need to cover their position to 
get out.  
You can see trapped sellers when the imbalance numbers are  at the 
bottom or a tick or two off the bottom and the market is not going lower 
and instead turns and goes higher and the price bar closes higher. 
There is a saying in the markets “someone has to sell the low” and it is 
usually the trapped sellers that do . Trapped sellers are usually the last 
people to sell in a move.  
 

Page 56 of 150 
 
You can see trapped buyers when the imbalance numbers are at the 
high or a tick or two off the high and the market is not going higher and 
instead turns and goes lower and the price bar clo ses lower.  Trapped 
buyers are usually the last people to buy in a move up.  These buyers will 
have to turn into sellers which adds to supply causing prices to move 
down.  
 
Trapped traders are those caught in a trade that moves against them 
and are hoping and praying that the market will quickly come back to 
their entry level so they can get out. Trapped traders usually find 
themselves on the wrong side of the market pretty quickly and are under 
immediate pressure to cover losses once price moves against th em. 

Page 57 of 150 
 
When you are able to find trapped buyers or sellers there is usually a 
good short term trad ing opportunity. While it may not signal the end of a 
long term trend, it can identify market turning points in the short term.   
 
Trends can start once the trap ped traders are shaken out of their losing 
positions and aggressive participants start to be active.    
Candlestick bars and traditional bar charts cannot show you trapped 
buyers or sellers. You need the ability to look inside the bar to determine 
what is a ctually going on in the market.  
When you look at the order flow you have solid clues the market is ready 
to pop higher.  
 

Page 58 of 150 
 
Order flow charts can be applied to longer term time frames. Of course 
not all trades will be as beautiful as these trades. But as you can see the 
profit potential is quite large. Just catching a few of these moves a year 
can really make reading the order flow footprint charts worthwhile.  
Here are another set of charts, this time in the 6E – the eurocurrency 
futures contract.  
 

Page 59 of 150 
 
 
Ok, I know it is a stretch to say trapped traders with 250 lots will turn the 
market and cause a trend in the opposite direction. Rather what is 
happening is that the market sentiment in general has changed. The 
market cannot carry through and the last buyers (o n a high) or the last 
sellers (on a low) have gotten in.  
 
  

Page 60 of 150 
 
ABSORPTION  
Markets are always looking for a level for two sided trade to take place. 
A price level where both buyers and sellers can participate back and 
forth without moving price very much . This  is called absorption. These 
are the price levels where both buyers and sellers are happy to transact 
major volume with each other. You will see big size trade into the bid 
and big size trade into the offer. The net difference between the two will 
be small  relative to the amount of volume that traded.  
A traditional technical analyst may think of absorption as consolidation. 
But there is a difference and that is volume. A market may consolidate 
because of a reason other than what is happening in the market. There 
may be a FED announcement so trading volumes have decreased and 
the ranges get small , this may look like absorption . There may be a 
holiday so volumes are low because traders are on vacation. It could be 
the day before the Non -Farm Payrolls number co mes out. These events 
and others can lead to consolidation  before price moves .  
Absorption on the other hand is a level where you see heavy volume go 
through bu t on both sides of the market – the bid side and the offer side.  
This is where inventory changes  hands.  
The big money long term commercial players don’t come in and butcher 
the market. They trade their size where there is size that can be traded. 
Big money moves markets, but usually it is not just one player. It might 
be a few big players, some mediu m size players and a bunch of smaller 
players. The place where they meet and do the majority of their trading 
is called an absorption level because that is the level where a lot of 
volume occurred but the market did not get affected by it. Both buyers 
and sellers were happy.  
 
Page 61 of 150 
 
 
The origin of any price move is where supply and demand start s to move 
out of balance. This is where the low risk, high probability and high 
reward entry levels are.  Prices start to turn higher when demand 
exceeds supply. Price turn s lower once supply exceeds demand. When 
the market starts to move out of absorption levels there are some great 
trading opportunities. The only way to see absorption is by looking at 
volume footprint charts.  
Absorption  can occur anytime in the market. When it occurs it is relative 
to what happens afterwards. Major trends do not happen immediately 
after each other. The start of a major trend is often seen after a period of 
absorption where one side of the market is able to build their position up. 
As absorption dries up price is free to move in the direction of 
aggressive buyers.  Once all the supply has been removed from the 
marketplace, the market is free to move higher without much resistance.  
Absorption  can be  presen t at the end of trends and profit taking mid -
trend. When absorption occurs it indicates demand is being met by new 
supply at market highs or supply is being met by new demand at market 

Page 62 of 150 
 
lows. Basically price is not able to move any further as new supply or 
demand appears in the markets.  
What is good about absorption is that it can be regarded as a sign for a 
breakout move as the buyers and sellers fight for control of the market. 
Once the transfer of supply or demand has taken place, price is likely to 
move away from value.  
One caveat with absorption, you tend to see absorption occur within the 
last few minutes of the day. This does not necessarily mean new supply 
or demand has come into the market, it can likely be attributed to day 
traders closing out their  positions be fore the end of the trading day and 
hedge funds trying to execute orders as close to the closing price as 
possible.  
  
Page 63 of 150 
 
INITIATIVE ACTIVITY  
Institutional long term players dictate trends and when the volume they 
wish to trade cannot be satisfied  at one price their perception of fair 
value shifts and price starts to trend. This is called initiative activity.  
To move a market outside of a value area it takes large orders. It takes 
institutional players. Retail traders just do not have the financia l 
resources to move prices for extended periods outside of value areas.  
 
 
 
If the market is trading above value as a result of buyer pressure that is 
initiative buying. If the market is trading below value because of selling 
pressure that is initiative selling.  
You have to understand where fair prices are and understand where 
unfair prices are. Once you start to move away from fair prices it is 
important to know why. Is it initiative activity?  Are buying taking the 
initiative to move prices higher? Or if the market is moving lower, are 
sellers taking the initiative to move the ma rket lower?  
When the market breaks out of a value area but there is no strong 
buying or selling pressure then you look for responsive activity which is 
in the form of limit orders. For example, when you buy a house you will 
usually submit a bid. If the price of the house is valued at $1 million and 
you like the house but you are not in a hurry to buy you may submit a bid 
of $750,000. The seller might then lower his price to $850,000 because 
he is a little more motivated to sell. But you are firm in your bid. 
Eventually the seller gets aggressive and lowers his price to your bid 
and sells it to you. You are a responsive buyer. The price of the house 
has moved below the value area. You are buying below value, but not 
aggressively.  
 VALUE AREA  
 
Page 64 of 150 
 
 
Breakout trades can hap pen in either direction of value. What is 
important to note is if there is any responsive activity to stop the move 
and push the market back into the value area.  
How do you determine what the value area is? The most common 
method is with Market Profile. It  is the area where 70% of the day’s 
trading occurs. The value area is based on what time period you decide.  
 

Page 65 of 150 
 
 
Once you learn to recognize the players, institutional or retail, by the 
order flow  footprint you can determine what type of activity is going o n.

CANDLESTICK CHARTS  & ORDER FLOW  
Candlestick charts are a simple visual form of tape reading and price 
action  and were created  by the Japanese a few hundred years ago . 
They show you were the market opened, the low, the high and where it 
closed for the period.  
Traders try to predict future price movements based on candlestick 
patterns that have formed.  There are all sorts of patterns with colourful 
names that traders look for: Abandoned Baby, Dark Cloud Cover, 
Hanging Man, Gravestone Doji  and many more. Sometimes the patterns 
are reliable, other times they are not.   
I think the reason candlestick charting has lost some of their 
effectiveness is that markets have evolved over the last several 
hundreds of years.  Market participants and thei r activities have 
changed. Japanese candlestick charting was developed in an era when 
there were no institutional traders or day traders or high frequency 
traders.  
 
This is not to say that candlestick charts are useless in today’s trading 
environment, be cause they are not. They give a quick visual colourful 

Page 67 of 150 
 
representation of the market which is useful to most traders. I do use 
candlestick charts in conjunction with order flow charts to help keep me 
abreast of the short term direction of a bar on the chart . It is important for 
me to know where the bar closed in relation to its open.  Actually a 
normal bar chart can also show that information, but aren’t as colourful.  
The essence of candlestick charting is the relationship between the 
opening price and closin g price. In simple terms, a long green  (I have 
mine set to green instead of traditional white, because my charts are 
white background) candlestick bar indicates buying pressure. However, 
you cannot understand the magnitude of the buying pressure without 
looking at the order flow. Even with candlestick charts it is difficult to 
know if the buying will continue or stop.  A red candlestick indicates that 
during the bar, the market closed at a lower price than it opened.  
Candlestick  charting  and also traditional  bar charting  methods fail to 
show  is what really happened during the bar. You can see a big white 
candle stick, which is a bullish candlestick, and conclude that buyers 
were aggressive. While that may be the logical conclusion to make as 
obviously buyers w ere in control to cause the bar to close much higher 
than it opened, you don’t know how much in control they were or if their 
control waned at the end.  
 

Page 68 of 150 
 
The order flow chart is on the left and the candlestick chart is on the 
right. In the run up in price there are five green up candlesticks, but in 
the fourth and fifth  candlestick you start to see aggressive selling come 
into the market as seen  in the fourth bar  (at 3:20) by the 790 lots traded 
on the bid at 2094.50 and 503 3 lots traded at 2094.00 . Also the bar had 
a negative delta of -1177 which is a sign of selling pressure . So while the 
bar still closed higher than it opened, there was more selling than buying 
in the bar.  On the fifth bar volume was less and the market couldn’t go 
any higher and you al ready had a sign in the previous bar that sellers 
were now coming into the market. I would be hesitant to buy at this level 
and more inclined to look to be a seller.  
Imagine a soccer game where the score ends 4 -0. You read the score 
line and see the final score 4 -0 and think the winner had a nice easy 
game all the way. But if you actually watched the game, you might see 
that the first 60 minutes the game was evenly matched as both sides 
failed to score. But over the last 30 minutes the winning team scored a  
goal and that caused the other team to change their style of play to try 
and tie the game. But winner scored yet another goal a few minutes later 
and it was now 2 -0 with 20 minutes to play. The losing team yet again 
changed their tactics and gave up anoth er goal. The score was then 3 -0. 
At this point the other team just played to run the clock out and gave up 
yet another goal and the match ended up 4 -0. If you just look at the final 
score you will think one thing, but when you dissect the match you see 
that it wasn’t until late that one team really asserted it dominance.  
Just looking at a candlestick form on a chart you may miss the essence 
of how the candlestick was actually formed. Did buyers or sellers 
become more dominant? Did one side give up? Did one  side become 
trapped ? Candlestick charts do not show that. Order flow charts do. If 
you were going to pick a winner in the soccer game, it is easier when the 
score is 2 -0 than when it is 0 -0.  
Candlestick charts are a useful tool by themselves, but when partnered 
with order flow they help create  a powerful analysis method.  
One of my favo urite trades occur when I see buying or selling 
imbalances in the wick areas that run contrary to the candlestick type to 
try and trade in the direction of the candle. For example, a red 
Page 69 of 150 
 
candlestick with buying imbalances near the top in the wicks and selling 
imbalances in the body, I look to short.  For example, the 6:35am bar, 
there were buying imbalances at the top near in the wick and selling 
imbalances in the body.  
 
The opposite is true with a green candlestick. I look for selling 
imbalances in the wick and buying imbalances in the body. What is 
happening in the bar is the market sells off first aggressively before 
aggressive buyers come in and really take control of th e market.  

Page 70 of 150 
 
 
The 8:45 bar a selling imbalance in the wick and buying imbalances in 
the body. The next bar at 8:50 the market went down and tested the low 
of the previous bar before rallying on the 8:55 bar.  
The setup works on a variety of charts, short term, like the 5 minute 
charts in the example above and even longer term like a 40 range chart:

WHAT KIND OF CHARTS CAN BE USED WITH ORDER FLOW  
I use a variety of charts daily in my analysis of the markets. I am not tied 
down to one particular type of ch art. To do so would be foolish. There 
are different types of participants in the market, from the extremely short 
term to very long term. If you decide to base all your trading decisions on 
one type of chart, say a 5 minute chart, you are missing out  on t he 
bigger picture.  
There are three types of charts I like to use: range charts, volume charts 
and time charts. Even though all three types of charts have the same 
variables of price, volume and time, it is how each chart uses them that 
makes it different a nd useful.  
My first choice of chart  to use is a volatility based chart , also known as 
range charts, where volume and time are variables. The market doesn’t 
care about every 5 minute time period or 15 minute time period or 
whatever time period you set your charts to . You want to  see where the 
market rotates. With a range chart, b ars are created when price moves. 
A 4 range bar chart will have a size of 4 bars. Price would have to move 
4 ticks for a new bar to be created. You can set the amount of bars to 
what ever you like. New bars will only form when price is moving. If price 
is not moving or stuck in a range within the bar, a new bar won’t form 
until it moves outside of the bar. When price breaks outside of the set 
range of the bar, a new bar will form.  
The second choice of chart  type that I use  is volume based charts where 
price and time are the variables. You can choose any amount of volume 
for this type of bar. Each bar will have roughly an equal amount of 
volume that is traded in that bar and when the vol ume exceeds the set 
amount a new bar will be formed. When I say each bar will have roughly 
an equal amount of volume, for example a 1000 volume bar, one bar 
may have 988 lots wh ile the next bar may have 1012. T his happens 
when trades are split between bars . Ther e will be times when it takes a 
lot of price levels to facilitate a trade of 1000 lots  and there will be times 
where 1000 lots can be traded without moving price. This is valuable 
information that can be used in making trading decisions.  
The third ty pe of chart that I look  at are time based charts where price 
and volume are variables.  This would be something like your normal 5 
Page 73 of 150 
 
minute chart.  However to get a handle on the importance of volume in 
trading you need periods where volume is trading. If the time period is 
too short there may not be enough volume traded to understand what is 
happening in the market. One minute charts is too short, five minutes 
give a better look on the market. Thirty minutes is good for longer 
duration trades that can last for  days. Time based charts are the way the 
majority of traders choose to view the market.  
You will see many examples in this book using time based charts in 
addition to range and volume charts. This just shows you how order flow 
footprint charts can be used  in various ways and how the market can be 
broken down.  
Given a choice between range based charts, volume based charts and 
time based charts I would choose range based charts followed by 
volume charts followed by time based charts.  
I am also interested in are daily, weekly and monthly charts. I find 
previous highs and lows are important to look at and keep in mind when 
trading today. Those are levels where the market stopped and turned 
due to supply and demand. When the market revisits those levels, I 
watch  to see if they are accepted or rejected again.

HIGH FREQUENCY TRADERS (HFT) AND SCALPERS  
There has been a lot of bad press about High Frequency Trading over 
the last several years. Some lawmakers even want to ban the practice. 
A majority of the bad press you hear about HFT’s comes out of the 
equity markets where there are multiple exchanges trading the same 
issues. Most HFT’s in equities work multiple orders across multiple 
exchanges so there can be a chain reaction when an issue trades on 
one exchan ge resulting in quick price movements in other related 
exchanges . This explains why a majority of  people think high frequency 
trading  is a way  for some traders to front run orders since a computer 
can react much faster than a human.  
The important function  of HFT’s  in futures markets  is that they provide 
liquidity in the markets.  I won’t get into the intricacies of HFT’s but suffice 
it to say that High Frequency Trading firms have become the new 
scalpers in the futures market. In the days of pit trading, lo cals would 
stand in the pit and make markets all day long,  trying to buy on the bid or 
sell on the offer,  holding positions for seconds or minutes. Now there are 
computer  programs  that essentially do the same thing. The programs 
work bids and offers across  multiple futures markets.  
HFT’s don’t have a clue what is going on in the world and don’t care. 
These programs are reacting to market movement before they occur. All 
other traders react after they occur. HFT’s don’t take positions and ride 
them as long as  they can. By their very definition “High Frequency 
Trading,” they are in and out of the market many times a day.  
Scalpers are traders who trade in the extreme short term. They 
originated from the trading pits where they would generally try and at 
least ca pture  the bid -ask spread.  However, in today’s trading 
environment scalpers do not try to capture just the bid -ask spread.  Yes, 
they will take just a one tick profit if that is all the market will give them, 
but usually they will try and make 4 -10 ticks if they can. Usually though, 
scalpers will get out of the market once they feel momentum has 
stopped. A more apt name for scalpers would be short term day traders.  
HFT’s and scalpers do use order flow analysis. They look for areas 
where orders will come in and try and jump ahead of those orders. That 
Page 75 of 150 
 
is why sometimes it appears that these guys  are front running your 
trades , when all they are doing is simply analysing order flow.  
You ar e not competing against HFT’s or scalpers  or the mythical group 
of traders known as “them”. You are competing against yourself. HFT’s 
do not control the market. They are reacting to market conditions and 
trading opportunities as they occur instantaneously.  There are much 
bigger participants in the market moving in and out daily. There are 
banks, pension funds, hedge funds, commercial producers, asset 
managers and more. You don’t know what their position is. You don’t 
know why they are getting in or out of a  position. What is important to 
you is how you are able to analyse what is going on in the market and 
profit from it.

INSTITUTIONS  AND THEIR USE OF ALGORITHMIC TRADING  
I mentioned earlier that on the basic fundamental level what move s a 
market are buyers  and sellers. When you break  it down I suppose  the 
one thing that moves markets is money  and it’s not a little bit of money – 
it’s A LOT of money.  
Who has the money to move markets? Hedge Funds, banks and 
commercials. For simplicity s ake I will refer to th ese players going 
forward as “i nstitutions .” In different markets they have  different  
identities . In commodity markets it may be a big commercial company 
like Cargill , ADM  or Unilever, a company involved in the production or 
consumption of a commodity . In stock indices it may be a fund 
management company like Profund  or Fidelity, a company that invests in 
the underlying stock markets . In the bond market it may be a player like 
Western Asset  Management Corporation , a company that invests in 
global gover nment bonds . 
Institutions generally are always involved in the market  in some way as  it 
is inherent to their business . Even if they don’t have a position, that can 
be considered a position.  Being on the side of the institutions is 
important because they ma ke the trend, they have the money to make 
the markets move up or down on a sustained basis.  
Let me be clear, when I t alk about i nstitutions, I don’t mean any one 
player in particular. It is their cumulative effort that moves the markets. 
Not only do they have the money, but they also have knowledge about 
the market  that not every trader is privy to. A market participant like 
Cargill will have better knowledge of Malaysian palm oil production in the 
near term than the average market participant simply becau se of their 
palm oil holdings and daily dealing with other suppliers.   
Institutions not only make the market, they are the market. If you are 
picking a side of the market to follow in the market place, the odds are 
tremendously better when you stay on the side of the institutions. But 
how do you know what the institutions are doing? Imagine they are a 
herd of elephants walking in the jungle. T hey are  knocking over trees, 
stepping on bushes and  leaving their footprints  everywhere. I t is easy to 
see what they  are doing.  Trading volume tells us what these trading 
elephants are doing in the market. By reading the v olume  in the order 
Page 77 of 150 
 
flow not only can we tell when an institution is active in the market but it 
also tells us whether  the surrounding  buyers or sellers are becoming 
stronger or weaker.  
The companies that produce commodities and turn them into products 
don’t get big by being wrong on the markets, at least not very often. 
Because of their size and their requirements for huge amounts of 
physical commodities these players are constantly in and out of the 
markets.   
Institutional traders are not concerned with well -known indicators like 
MACD, RSI and Stochastics. They are concerned with the current and 
future state of supply and demand and use  this analysis to make their 
trading decisions. They listen to  what the market is telling them and 
react accordingly.   
But the hard part is determining when an Institution is participating in the 
market. In the old days, when Institutions had to place thei r trades 
through brokers, if you had a good relationship with your broker they 
would tell you who was buying and selling. For example, if you called 
down to the SP500 floor and your broker said “Deutsche Bank is buying” 
or “Goldman ’s is selling”. Then if y ou knew Paul Tudor Jones traded 
through Goldman ’s in the SP500 pit, you were led to believe Paul Tudor 
Jones himself was selling. That was how order flow was back in the day 
of pit trading. Many i nstitutions now execute their trades themselves 
electronical ly through broker provided trading front ends so it is not as 
easy as it once was. One way to tell what an institution is doing is by 
reading the order flow . You will see huge size go through particular 
levels. It is important to watch the edges of the mar ket. The day’s high 
and low, was there a big buyer or seller? Where were the levels of 
aggression?  
A lot is written these days about the evils of algorithmic trading. Most 
people hav e no idea what algo trading is  and they lump in with high 
frequency tradi ng. Algo trading in one sense, as applied for futures 
markets, is a way to execute orders with minimal market impact. It could 
be something as simple as an iceberg order or more complex like a 
ghost bid where the order is only shown when the market is offe red at a 
level where the customer wants to buy it.  
Page 78 of 150 
 
The reason these “algo s” were created was for i nstitutional players to 
hide their activities in the electronic mar ket. If everyone knows that an 
institution has 1000 lots of corn to buy at 378.00 then othe r participants 
will also start to buy corn, but not at the same price, maybe just a little bit 
higher at 378.25 and 378.50 before the market starts to move higher and 
the Institution can’t get filled at their level of 378.00 . So banks and hedge 
funds started to create algos to mask their market activities. I won’t get 
into all the different types of algo trades that are available because that 
would be another book, what is important to know is that whatever 
volume that is trade d in the market either on the bid or offer will show up 
in the order flow.  
Size does  matter  in the markets  and i nstitutions do not want to tip their 
hand to everyone else. You have to realize that most markets just do not 
have the available size an institu tional size player  wants to trade. An 
institution may want to trade 3000 lots but there may only be 300 lots 
available at a price , 100 lots at the next price, 100 lots at the next price, 
50 lots at the next, etc . So to get their order completed they would  either 
have to push the market to an unrealistic level or try and finesse their 
order into the market.  
Sometimes institutions have orders so l arge that they  it can take hours 
or even days to move or build their position efficiently without bullying  
the ma rket. There are players that have positions of 200,000 ES futures, 
100,000 bunds, etc.  Although they don’t get in or out all at once, when 
they add or reduce positions it can be in the 5,000 -10,000 lot size.  
One of the things I learned as a broker about t he biggest and juiciest 
orders from Institutions is that they do not always get filled. An Institution 
has a level or price range they want to participate at and stick with it. 
They don’t call back and ask their broker to chase the market. They want 
to get  in at the price  levels  they want , they don’t want to move the 
market  and know that even if they miss the  trade by a tick, its ok, there 
will be other opportunities in the future.  Institutional traders don’t panic 
the same way retail traders do when the ma rket starts moving and they 
are not getting filled on their orders.

Here is an example on solid institutional buying in the corn market:  
 
In the example above, all you know is that someone is trying to buy a 
truck load of corn and that caused a short term rally of about 20 cents 
over the next few days.  
Now the rub is you 
don’t know exactly if 
the institution is buying 
to get into a position or 
get out of one.  They 
could be hedging their 
position. No one really 
knows except the 
actual people doing the 
buying.  Ultimately you 
just don’t know the 

Page 80 of 150 
 
reason W HY they are active in the market. A majority of the volume you 
see daily is pure speculation, either long term or short term. However 
there is a portion of volume that is end users buying for delivery.  
If you constantly trade against i nstitutions you will have a hard time 
being profitable in the long run. Futures’ trading has  attracted some of 
the sharpest minds on the planet. At the very least, all you have to do is 
trade in the same direction as them. If  you are going to be trading 
alongside the institutions you need a way to determine the level of 
institutional activity in the market place or the lack of it. Order flow 
provides you that opportunity.  
I am not saying you have to copy what the institutions are doing  to be 
successful. What I am saying is if you buy when the institutions are 
buying and sell when the institutions are selling you stand a far higher 
chance of success than trying to go against them  constantly . At the very 
least you need to be awar e of what the big players are doing.

VWAP  
VWAP stands for Volume Weighted Average Price and is perhaps the 
most commonly us ed algorithm for trading today ; it assumes the markets 
are efficient. The reason it is important is because it is the benchmark by 
which trade exe cution is measured. I t is the average price at which the 
majority of a given period’s trading took place weighted by volume at 
each price level.  In other words it means to fill a trade where everyone 
else is trading.  
A broker c an add value by working an order with their discretion , buying 
when they thought the market  was cheap or selling when the price 
looked rich  based on their subjective judgement about the market . 
VWAP is a replacement for that.  
When an Institution has large orders that m ust be filled they will often 
use a VWAP based algorithm to execute the order as close to VWAP as 
possible. By executing their order as close to VWAP as possible it 
indicates that they have been able to minimize the market impact of their 
order. Hedge fund s are conscious of their market impact costs which are 
the costs incurre d by trades  so big that they will move the market.  
In a simple form VWAP is used to determine value for i nstitutional 
traders  much in the same way a moving average works as a trading 
indicator . But VWAP is used more for trade analysis than trade entry . 
When a buy order is filled at a price better than VWAP it is good for the 
trader as the average transaction value is better than what everyone 
else in market for that time period also re ceived. The reverse is also true 
for when one is selling. If a sell order is filled at a price better than 
VWAP the trader is selling at a higher average price than everyone else 
during that time period. VWAP is the measuring stick for large orders.  
When p rice is below VWAP, i nstitutions that are looking to buy will tend 
to buy at prices below VWAP as they are able to build a position that is 
better than the VWAP. They won’t be that willing to buy when the price is 
trading above VWAP as it will ruin their own average price against 
VWAP.  
When price is above VWAP, i nstitutions that are looking to sell or get 
short will try to execute their orders as they are selling at prices that they 
feel are better than what has been recently trading. If an institution is 
Page 82 of 150 
 
trying to fill an order they won’t be as willing to buy when price is trading 
above VWAP, they may buy some just to participate in case price never 
comes back to VWAP, but it will be minimal.  
The interesting thing about VWAP orders is that there is no guar antee 
that it will be filled or that it will match VWAP.  
So why is VWAP important? For an intraday trader VWAP is important 
because they can determine if they are selling too cheap or buying to 
rich. When prices start moving 1 or 2 standard deviations abov e VWAP 
and you are buying you could be buying at prices too expensive. 
Conversely, if you are selling and prices are 2 standard deviations below 
VWAP you could very well be selling too cheap.  This is not to say that 
prices cannot move 3  and even 4  standard  deviations away from VWAP 
because it can.  
When trading with order flow you can lay VWAP lines on your chart to 
give you an indication if it trading cheap or rich. I am more prone to take 
buy signals when the market is trading cheap and sell signals when the 
market is trading rich to VWAP.  
Do not think for a minute that VWAP has to revert to the mean. A market 
can stay above or below VWAP most of the day.  
VWAP is not without its limitations. As the trading day goes on the lag in 
VWAP become stronger. This is because a lot of trade data has already 
been factored in and new trade data has less of an impact on the overall 
VWAP number and will tend to flatten out. On strong trending days price 
will be above or bel ow VWAP pretty much all day. On  range trading da ys 
VWAP will run through the middle of price action.  On days when 
important news comes into the market late in the day, that cause 
significant price movements on heavy volume the VWAP profile will be 
affected.  How an order is executed will also affect the VWAP since the 
average execution sits somewhere between the bid and offer spread. To 
match VWAP an order would need to be a combination of limit orders 
and market orders.  
A problem I see with VWAP with the trading public is they don’t fully 
understand how or why it is used. The trading public is using it as a form 
of moving average and think that when the market breaks through 
Page 83 of 150 
 
VWAP to look for it to go to the 1st standard deviation and revert back to 
the mean. In theory that should happen. But the reality i s it doesn’t 
happen. I spent 8 years at JP Morgan executing VWAP trades for the 
biggest hedge funds in the world and some of the biggest internal bank 
traders. Orders are only executed over a part of the day, for example 
from cash open to cash close or the  first hour of cash open, etc.  Very, 
very few orders are executed VWAP from the exact open to the exact 
close which is what most software will calculate and draw on a chart. An 
order executed over the first hour beginning at the cash open would only 
look a t VWAP for that time period, not the entire day VWAP.  Large 
orders need to trade where the size in the market. A majority of trade 
happens at the open and the close.  
 
Don’t be misled into thinking that VWAP is a new excellent indicator to 
take trades against. As I mentioned earlier, VWAP is a way to measure 
a broker ’s trade execution. Traders make money by buying low and 
selling high, not by beating VWAP.

ICEBERG ORDE RS 
One of the tricks that traders use to disguise their intentions in the 
market is by placing their orders using the iceberg function. Simply put, 
iceberg orders are  just large orders that are hiding their true size.  A 
trader may have 500 lots of corn to buy, but will enter his order with an 
iceberg of 50 lots, meaning he will only show 50 lots at a clip. When the 
first 50 lots are filled then another order for 50 lots will be entered 
automatically.  
Iceberg orders have mixed meanings these days simply bec ause 
everyone uses them, even retail traders trying the trade 5 lots – they will 
iceberg the order to show 1 lot. Iceberg orders are used in nearly all 
markets nowadays, even thinly traded ones. In some markets depending 
on the time of day, a 10 lot order can spook the market a few ticks.  
Unfortunately to see iceberg orders one has to be watching the order 
book and what is trading in order to see them. There is no special 
designation in the ticker for them. Icebergs are obvious when you are 
watching the bid /ask and you are buying the offer, but every time you 
buy the offer it refreshes the quantity and doesn’t break through the 
level.  
In my past life as an institutional futures broker we would almost always 
use icebergs on orders that were over 50 lots.  It was normal for us to 
iceberg orders that we needed to get done immediately. If I had to buy 
500 lots of soybeans, I would use an iceberg of maybe 15 lots per clip 
and immediately lift the offer. If I know the size of my order will move the 
market I may eve n buy it 1 or 2 ticks beyond the offer to get a good 
portion of the trade on. So it is not uncommon to see iceberg orders 
appearing  in the middle of nowhere and sometimes you may not even 
notice it.  
What is tricky about Icebergs is that they can be signifi cant or totally 
irrelevant. You have to take them in the market context.  An iceberg 
order in the middle of a range can mean nothing. It can be part of a 
spread trade against a physical trade and the trade doesn’t want to 
spook the market by showing his en tire size. In this case the trader 
doesn’t really have a view of direction on the market as he is hedging.  
Page 85 of 150 
 
Icebergs that I have found to be significant are ones that are hold ing up 
or holding down a market, usually long term macro levels and 
psychological levels. These are l evels where the market can’t seem to 
get below or above. The volume keeps refreshing when it trades a 
certain quantity. When these Icebergs are take n out the market can 
explode really quick  in that direction. An iceberg on its own will not stop 
a screaming market. But it can serve as a sign of absorption, where 
price is being absorbed by the market participants.  
Along this thread, an iceberg can stop a pullback  in the market as there 
may be  some significant size behind it  and a pullback has weaker 
selling, but it mo st likely will not stop a trend because with a trend there 
is a tendency for aggressive participants to come in and take out levels.  
A buy iceberg on a market moving up near highs  is important as it can 
signal that a long term timeframe trader is getting involved in the market 
and doesn’t want to show his hand as he is building a position. The 
reverse is true as a market nears its lows or is making new lows. These 
other time frame traders may be coming into the market to move size 
and are afraid of moving price too much before they can get their entire 
size off.  But I think taking a trade based on an iceberg order appearing 
in the order book is a leap of faith.  
The problem with iceb erg orders is you have to be watching the market 
trade to notice them. There is no way to look at a chart after the market 
closed and see it.  I think finding iceberg orders to use as a trade entry is 
over rated as they appear too frequently to add any valu e in making a 
trading decision.  
In the end the traded volume from iceberg orders that are filled or even 
partially filled will show up in the order flow chart. It is understandable 
that institutional traders want to hide their market activities and really the 
only way to see what the institutional traders are doing is by looking at 
an order flow chart.  
  
Page 86 of 150 
 
SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE  
Every trader should have levels they look for in a market that determine 
support  and resistance. How price acts at points that a trader considers 
critical is important to your trading. You want to determine if other time 
frame traders are coming into the market at these levels to either defend 
a price level or push the market through the price level to a new level.  
There are many wa ys to find support and resistance levels. You can use 
traditional technical analysis such as pivot points, Fibonacci 
retracements, moving averages, previous highs and lows, etc. The 
question you want to a sk is once you have your levels how do you know 
whet her these levels are going to hold or break? You let the volume tell 
you what the market wants to do.  
Here is an example using Fibonacci retracements on 60 minute corn 
charts. Corn is a great market to trade. A lot of traders turn their noses 
up at the agr icultural markets in favour of faster moving currencies and 
stock indices but there are no truer market s to supply and demand as 
the agricultural markets.  
 

Page 87 of 150 
 
 
 

Page 88 of 150 
 
Order flow charts give the trader plenty of information to make informed 
trading decisions especially when combined with their own view of the 
market.  
If we are coming into a resistance level and we see buy volume slowing 
down or coming into a support level and see sell volume slowing down 
this is a good indication the market may reverse. That i s why you need 
to know where support and resistance are located . Otherwise you may 
just be poking around in the dark trying to understand if the market is at 
a turning point.  You need effort to break through a support or resistance 
level and continue in th at direction. This effort is usually shown by 
aggressive participants in the market place.  
Look for macro levels in the market to trade around. A macro level is one 
that is large in scope and is easily seen and watched by market 
participants.  When a macro level is penetrated it attracts long term 
money in the form of institutions as they come in to the market to 
reposition themselves and take profits or loses.  Is volume heavy at these 
levels? Is this level being defended or abandoned? Are buyers or sellers 
being aggressive? Looking at a n order flow  chart will tell you what is 
going on and tell you what to do.  
  
Page 89 of 150 
 
PREVIOUS HIGHS AND LOWS  
An often overlooked suppor t and resistance level is the previous day’s 
high, low and close. These are levels that market perceived as being too 
expensive (yesterday’s high) or too cheap (yesterday’s low). Baring a 
change in fundamentals what makes a trader think those prices won’t 
hold again today?  
One of my favourite trades is when a market struggles to stay below 
yesterday’s lows  and I see big volume numbers trading on the bid side . I 
look for signs for a bounce higher. There is a well -established tendency 
among retail traders to place their stop levels above the previous high or 
below the previous low. This is a sign that there is support at these low 
prices because when short term traders try to move the price lower a 
bigger stronger other time frame participant s are  willing to b uy their 
selling.  
 

Page 90 of 150 
 
 
If the market starts to trade above and more importantly stay above the 
previous day’s high with heavy volume that signals that new buyers are 
coming in. What the market is telling you is that yesterday the market 
couldn’t go any higher, but since the market close, something in the 
market fundamentals may have changed enticing new buyers to come 
into the market and get involved.  If the market can’t stay above 
yesterday ’s high and sellers come in, then watch out below. Look for a 
move to the downside.  

Page 91 of 150 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Page 92 of 150 
 
The previous day’s close is an important level for the current day trading 
since the previous day’s close is the price level that positions are 
marked to market against. It is the level that institutions use to determine 
if their position is making money o r losing money. When today’s prices 
start to trade to the previous day’s closing price, keep an eye on volume 
for signs of further moves. I am looking for levels to trade around.  
 
An important high and low to watch  is the previous month’s levels as 
they s how where price was contained over an extended period of time. 
When the market takes out one of these levels you know that change is 
occurring in the market place.  I find  there are three things that can 
happen when you trade at last month’s high or low. 1.  The market will 
fail to take out the level and trade back into the range. 2. The market will 
take out the  high or  low and then re -enter the 2 month range  and bounce 
off the level as it is rejected once again . 3. Trade outside of the 2 month 
range and stay  outside of the 2 month range  and new participants come 
into the market . The 2nd and 3rd market action s are where the big 
opportunit ies are as the market previous month’s  highs or lows.  
Short term traders who are not aware of long term levels have a high 
chance of getting run over by institutional trade participating at these 

Page 93 of 150 
 
levels. Additionally, they may miss the potentially large intraday trading 
opportunities these levels often present.  
So let’s take a look at what happens with a test of a monthly high and 
low. In this example I will use the September -15 Corn futures.  
 

Page 94 of 150 
 
 

Page 95 of 150 
 
 
What I like about this chart is that as the market traded below the low 
you see 2 101 lots were sold into the bid at 352.50, 17 58 lots sold into 
the bid at 352.25 and only 378 sold into the bid at 352.00. But as the 
market started trading back up, only 467 lots were bought at 352.25 and 
868 lots bought at 352.50, this signals to me that there isn’t much 
interest in sellers trying to  work offers below 352.75. In the 10:00am bar 
there is 1 102 lots bought at the offer at 353.25 and 2821lots  bought at 
the offer at 353.50. Obviously someone had some selling to do, but the 
market participants  just swallowed it up and kept the market biddin g 
higher.  
Now let’s look at what happened when the previous month’s high of 
376.00 was tested.  
 

Page 96 of 150 
 
 
This is a beautiful chart. The market traded right up to exactly the high of 
376.00 came off, tried again in the next bar and couldn’t quite make it 
back to t he level. It was a tick off at 375.75 but a big seller appeared to 
cap the buying  and the market sold off for the time being.  
The next day the market made a run at the high again and here is what 
happened:  

Page 97 of 150 
 
 
This is exactly what you want to see with order flow. Strong buying 
coming into a previous high, preferably aggressive buy ers leaving 
buying imbalances and just moving through the level like it wasn’t even 
an important level. The market never looked back.  
While the market may not approach long term leve ls like previous 
month’s or even yearly highs and lows  very often , when it does the 
levels are extremely important. Institutions will often reduce their risk by 
taking off positions when the market reaches long term levels. If prices 
become accepted outsid e the price levels contained by the long term 
levels, these same institutions may decide  to re-establish their position 
or enter into new positions.

TODAY’S HIGH AND LOWS  
The high and low of the day is generally not going to be known until after 
it has been made. However there are often signs in the volume footprint 
if a high or low is going to hold.  By judging the type of buying and selling 
occurred at a high or low you can determine if that level will in fact be the 
high or low.  Sometimes it is easy to  see, other times you won’t know for 
sure. Stick with the ones that are easy to see as they offer the best 
reward for least risk.  
 
Trying to pick the day’s high or low can be like trying to catch a falling 
knife. However the nice thing about order flow i s it can give you some 
trading opportunities once a high  or low  is made. You will never sell the 
exact high or low with order flow, but you can find trading opportunities 
just after the high or low has been made.  
Also if a high or low has been made, when t he market comes back to 
test the level it will either succeed or fail. Here is an example of when a 
high was made, point A and subsequent failures at point B and C.

As a trader your job is to find trades. That is how you get paid. But more 
importantly you need to find trades that have solid reasoning behind 
them.  
Futures markets now trade almost around the clock from Sunday night 
until Friday afternoon. A trading day which used to be 6 hours can now 
be as long as 23 hours. You don’t see gaps  occurring as much as you 
used to. Now if something happens in the evening or early morning, the 
markets are open and can react accordingly. Highs and lows made 
outside the normal trading day hours, ie overnight, often can  help set the 
range for the day.  
 
Around the clock trading is significant because it gives traders in other 
locations a better opportunity to trade. Highs and low that are made 
during the overnight session are significant levels to watch during the 
day. Unless the market is in a trending mode, the highs and/or lows 
made during the night sessions will be revisited at some point during the 
day session and it is important to watch how markets react to those 
levels. All major brokers and institutional trading firms  have fully staffed 
desks tha t trade around the clock in all time zones. They are constantly 

Page 102 of 150 
 
reacting to fundamentals affecting the market, trading accordingly and 
adjusting their positions. Keep an eye  on the levels made overnight.  
What I love about order flow  charts is that you can  determine where and 
when  buyers and sellers are being aggressive. When the market is 
making new highs I like to see aggressive buyers. This shows me that 
the buyers are clearly in control. If I don’t see aggressive buyers and 
instead see aggressive sellers near the high, I will look for the market to 
sell off. You always want to know who is in control of a high or low.  
 
How about when a market comes back to the high or low? You  want to 
determine if the level will be taken out and a new high or low made. If a 
high is to hold I like to see some aggressive selling come in and defend 
the level. Just as I would expect with a low, I would expect to see 
aggressive buying come in.  If a low is going to be taken out, I expect to 
see aggressive selling come in at the level and below it.  

Page 103 of 150 
 
 
When a market struggles to take out a high chances are lower that it will 
make a new high later in the session. Conversely, if a market struggles 
to take out a low then the chances are lower that it will make a new low 
later in the session. Again volume footprint charts tell you when a market 
is struggling to take out a high or low.  
A good sign  to look for to decide  if a high or low is going to hold is if 
there are stacked volume imbalances of sellers (at a high) or buyers (at 
a low). A stacked imbalance is where there are a multiple levels of 
volume imbalances. A stacked imbalance shows who has taken control 
of the price area.  If you are at a low and see st acked buying imbalances 
that is a sign that aggressive buyers have come into the market to 
sweep it off its lows. If you see selling imbalances near a high that is a 
sign that aggressive sellers have come in to move the market lower.  
While you won’t see ac tivity like this at every high or low, when it does 
appear you can trade with more confidence.  
Markets rally off of lows for two reasons. Traders are covering shorts. 
Traders are getting long.  

Page 104 of 150 
 
Markets fall off highs for two reasons. Traders are taking prof its (in other 
words covering their longs, but it is not phrased in that way). Traders are 
getting short.  
Picking when a high of day or low of day occurs and the subsequent 
reversal can be extremely rewarding, but can be dangerous if you are 
wrong and don’ t manage the trade properly.  
Order flow  charts give you the ability to look inside the bar  as it is 
forming on the chart . There are certain patterns I like to look for at and 
near highs and lows. They are large prints and small prints.  
When you see HUGE volume as you reach highs it is a good sign the 
market may turn if there is no follow through or there is signs of 
absorption. If a market cannot break through huge passive sellers and 
turns lower, the weak buyers on the way up will be lo oking to get out of 
their positions before they suffer losses causing a liquidation break. The 
result of this is that the weak hands are cleared out of the market on the 
liquidation break, their supply has been transferred to the stronger hands 
and the mar ket is now ready to rally again. This is the meaning of the 
saying “a market needs to break before it can rally.” I carry forward this 
previous level of HUGE volume that traded on the offers at a high to 
future trading sessions to watch and perhaps when we  reach that level 
again.  
It is important to note that the huge volume doesn’t have to occur exactly 
at one price point. It can be scaled in there as it is not uncommon for 
passive sellers to work scale orders.  
Page 105 of 150 
 
 
Large prints  that you see  at a high signify  that there is a large seller, it 
could be one institution or it could be a combination of several market 
participants deciding that the high is such a great level to sell that they 
sell as much as they can to all the willing buyers . They want to get rid o f 
excess inventory at advantageous prices. This is obvious is in a n order 
flow footprint chart because it sticks out like a sore thumb. When y ou 
see an abnormally large volume print at the high the market is telling you 
that institutions are selling to suc h an extent that higher prices are not 
possible. The market has basically been “capped.” Institutions will not 
cap the market if they expect higher prices ; they will  do it if they expect 
lower prices.  
When you see abnormally large prints at a high it shows  that institutional 
selling has come in to the market and is willing to offer their supply for 
sale. This will usually stop an up move at least in the short term. When 
the market comes back to test the highs and cannot break that high, it is 
a sign of mark et weakness.  
 

Page 106 of 150 
 
 
 

Page 107 of 150 
 
When you see abnormally large prints at a low it shows that institutional 
buying has come in to the market and is willing to accept all the supply 
available. This will usually stop a down move at least in the short term. 
When the market comes back to test the lows and cannot break that low, 
it is a sign of market strength. The opposite is true for large prints at a 
high.  
Small prints at a high or low are just as significant, especially if it comes 
after a large print. It shows that the la st buyer (at a high) has given up or 
that the last seller (at a low) has given up. Markets that are rallying stop 
and go down when the last buyer has bought and there are no more 
buyers. Markets that are going down stop and reverse when the last 
seller has  sold. Granted single prints are extreme, but I like trades that 
stick out like a sore thumb. You can actually use single digit prints. Like 
3 or 5 or 8.  
 
This is how the trade played out  over the next few days … 

Page 108 of 150 
 
 
Single prints suggest weakness. The marke t simply cannot follow 
through in that direction and turns. It could be caused by someone trying 
to trigger stops. It could be the absolute last buyer came in and bought.  
When you see extremely large prints or single prints at a top or bottom 
look for a tu rn in the opposite direction. The risk for these trades is small 
as it is just behind the print that stuck out.  
Knowing when a market is ready for a reversal offers low risk entry 
points with possible high returns. Trying to identify them with a traditiona l 
bar chart can be difficult, but if you follow the order flow you can notice it 
developing and trade it accordingly.  
Time spent at a high or low is also important. For example, when the 
market spends a long time near the lows without any downside follow 
through. The market came down to the low and sort of hung around and 
trade was slowing down and the market just could not push any lower, 
the intraday short start to become anxious. They had helped to push the 
market down to the lows but they weren’t getti ng paid for it. Prices then 
start to tick higher, the short term traders start to cover, pushing the 
market higher causing more traders to cover their short positions. 
Ultimately there is a short cove ring rally and the low is made.

MACRO  APPROACH   
The macro approach is how I  approach the market on a daily basis . I 
want to get a big picture market perspective so I s tart with a longer term 
monthly and weekly charts. Do I see upward continuation, downward 
continuation? Then I will look at daily and intraday charts and ask myself 
is the market in balance? What are the value areas? What are levels 
where there were  big passive buyers or sellers?   
Each day before the market opens I identify these levels since these are 
the levels I will be trading around.  Traders  often get so focused on the 
short -term market trends, economic reports, Bloomberg news,  CNBC 
TV, etc. that they do not keep a perspective on w hat the market is 
actually telling them .  
More often than not traders remain too narrowly focused on price and 
short-term bars, never fully appreciating the market’s ongoing auction 
process  that takes place daily . By taking a step back and looking at the 
bigger picture you will get a clearer market perspective and it will save 
you from becoming hypnotized by intraday  price action.  Staring at a 
DOM or a chart all day can be dizzying.  
With a macro approach I can see where the important long term levels 
are in the market so I can react accordingly.  
  
Page 110 of 150 
 
TRADIN G NUMBERS  
Knowing where price can trade to and react off of  is essential to success 
in trading. You cannot just approach the market with a gut feeling for the 
day and trade according to it.  
Building on the macro  approach, each day we must prepare for the 
trading day by making a note of important levels where the m arket may 
have reactions.  
 Yearly High  
 Yearly Low  
 High 2 months ago  
 Low 2 months ago  
 Last month’s  high  
 Last month’s low  
 High 2 days ago  
 Low 2 days ago  
 Close 2 days ago  
 Yesterday’s high  
 Yesterday’s low  
 Yesterday’s close  
 Overnight high  
 Overnight low  
 Resistance  
 Support  
 Pivot Point  
 Yesterday’s Value Area High  
 Yesterday’s Value Area Low  
 Economic Releases due today and time  
 Any economic events today and time  
It may seem like a lot of numbers to keep track of, but the reality of it  is 
that it should only t ake a few minutes to make note of these levels on 
your chart.

OTHER FORCES  
One of t he basic premise s in trading  is that markets will do what they are 
supposed to do. If they do not do what they are supposed to do, then 
there is a reason. That reason is that there are unusually strong forces 
at work temporarily acting contrary to what the markets want to do. The 
trade r can take advantage of this knowledge and go with the temporary 
strong forces and make a profit.  It may not be known why the other 
forces i n the market until much later, but being able to recognize them 
allows a trader the chance at short term profits.  
When you see a big amount of volume trading at a top and the market 
can’t go bid there, that is a sign of weakness. You  should look to get 
short there because there is another force at work. There are ample 
traders buying but the market just cannot go any higher as it should. 
This is a clear sign of other forces at work.  
You will never know the intentions of a trader  yet to enter the market. At 
any given moment there could be an institutional player ready to step 
into the market and move it opposite of what you predicted.  
An outside factor in the market that causes havoc with order flow is 
when there is an economic report coming out or an FOMC me eting. 
Order flow will dry up ahead of the announcement and explode just after 
the announcement. When I started out in the futures business as a clerk 
on the CME floor one of the things I learned was that when a number 
like Non -Farm Payrolls comes out the institutional players are not the 
ones doing all the trading that causes the knee jerk spike up and down 
reaction to price that you see on the chart. They are already positioned 
on how they view the market. It is usually the weak holders scrambling 
to cove r their position and stops getting hit. When the market slows 
down and has stabilized is the time when the institutional players will 
decide what to do. Sometimes the actual market direction might not 
emerge until the day after a big announcement or number . 
I am an advocate of staying out of the market slightly before and just 
after any important number or announcement when trading in the short 
term. Of course there will be times the market just gets blindsided with 
some news. You just have to be prepared t o take the loss.

LONG TERM  APPLICATIONS OF ORDER FLOW  
Most traders who use order flow tend to apply it to short term trading 
decisions. However it can also be applied to longer term outlooks. 
Position traders attempt to come up with models to forecast price 
movements of markets by analysing supply and demand forces in the 
economy, economic indicators and even government policy.   
One of the problems with forecasting models is that past variables are 
used to extrapolate future values. A market forecast is  only as strong as 
the data used to make it. Unfortunately fundamental data is usually 
based on samples and are estimates at best. These estimates are 
usually subject to revision.  
The same t heories of order flow that appear intraday  can be applied on 
long term charts.  Here is a nice example of the Euro Currency futures. It 
hit a high at 1.1450 on June 18th then sold off about 250 ticks over the 
next few days  and down below 1.0850 over the next month . Could you 
have predicted it by looking at t raditional ca ndlestick or bar  charts? 
Maybe you could have . It is always easy to look at a chart after the fact 
and say that you would have sold here and bought there. You wouldn’t 
have sold the exact high, but realistically you could have sold around the 
1.1400 level.  What you need are concrete signs of a turning point.  
 

Page 113 of 150 
 
And here it is. At the high of 1.1450 you have a buying imbalance of 944.  
 
By itself 944 is a big number. But for extra confirmation you also have a 
buying imbalance at the top when the bar closed lower than it opened. 
On the two preceding bars on the way up you can see some buying 
imbalances and the market still went up. When it hit 1.1450 the market 
hit a br ick wall. There was a big seller or sellers, it doesn’t really matter if 
it was one or more. The buyers just could not push the market any 
higher past that level. Then you see a stacked selling imbalance on the 
way down. The short term traders who bought a t 1.1450 are now stuck 
and got to get out and they can’t sell fast enough.  

Page 114 of 150 
 
This top just sticks out like a sore thumb as a reversal.  
Here is the daily chart. Again based on a daily candlestick would you 
have sold?   There are a couple of ways to look at it.  You can say that 
1.1450 is a nice round number so there should be some resistance 
there. But if that is the case, why did it blow through 1.1400 even on the 
way up and down? The previous month’s high was 1.1486. So we are 
still 36 ticks off from it. With order flow and looking inside the bar you 
can see what is actually going on between the buyers and sellers to 
make informed  trade decisions. Order flow can identify reversals that 
may not be obvious to the rest of the trading world and that is reason 
enoug h to use them.  
The advantage of order flow analysis is that the underlying forces of the 
market are shown in a recognizable visual form. The market participants 
are showing you what their intentions are.

TRADE MANAGEMENT  AND  MONEY MANAGEMENT  
Trade mana gement is an overlooked part of trading. Nearly every book 
written on trading covers money management. While defining your 
monetary risk per trade is important, a trader should be able to manage 
their trades to earn the maximum they can out of a position w hile 
knowing when a trade is not working out.  
Professional traders recognize the fact that even when they do 
everything right, they will sometimes find themselves on the wrong side 
during a trade.  Market conditions are always changing and they accept 
that it is part of trading. Even the best looking trade set ups will 
sometimes fail.  
Create a set of rules that give you an edge. If the rules are not met then 
no trade, PERIOD. Once you start to bend the rules you start getting into 
trouble and getting into to trouble leads to one thing – loses. Pick your 
spots to get into and out of trades. Ideally what you want are “sweet 
spots” of entry so that if the market starts to move against you it doesn’t 
feel like it.  
By taking a reasonable profit if there are signs in a change of trend or 
change of reason for taking the trade you may avoid a loss. You do give 
up profit potential though. But more importantly you have the chance to 
trade again. When trading w ith order flow you can usually see levels 
where the markets reach a level and can’t move anymore. Or you can 
see that the market is full of aggressive players and there is no need to 
get out of the position yet.  
All successful traders practice sound trade and money management. 
Traders minimize their los ses and maximize their wins. There is no 
worse feeling than having been up substantially in a trade only to exit the 
trade at a loss simply because you lost your discipline with your trading 
plan, money manag ement and failed to heed your exit strategy.  
There are only five possible outcomes to any trade.  You can have a big 
winner, a small winner, a break -even trade, a small loser or a large 
loser. You can make a lot of money trading if you do any of the above, 
except taking repeated large losses. This is why stop have to be used in 
some form.  But you need to monitor the trade so you are not always 
Page 116 of 150 
 
getting stopped out for the maximum loss.  Scaling out of positions gives 
you a way to get out with a small profit ra ther than a total loss.  
I like to get in, capture what part of the trend I can, get my money and 
get out. There comes a point in every trader’s life that he will realize that 
he will not pick up every tick in a trend.  
Let me give you an example, let’s say you decide to go long corn at 
357.75, you know that at 351.00 that your set up would be invalid so that 
is your stop level. You have a target at 380.00. At first the trade goes 
well and corn rallies up to 373.00, then the market starts to range trade 
and you notice some absorption appearing around the 371.00 level, then 
the market start to drop to 367.00 on some aggressive sellers. The 
market conditions have changed and there are two clear signs of market 
weakness. You didn’t reach your profit target and the conditions are now 
such that it looks unlikely that you will. You can either start cutting your 
position and taking some profits, or you can just try and let it run in a 
“damn the torpedos” type of trade – either go to the target level or go to 
the stop level. The former would be the prudent thing to do since the 
market has already shown you that it has changed.  
Loses are a part of trading. That is a fact. One way of looking at it is it is 
part of doing business. That  is why you have to control your lo sses. 
Keep them small and manageable. Don’t let one loss be the cause of 
your entire trading career failure. A loss should not be a bullet to the 
head. It should be more of a punch to the body , one that you can take 
and k eep trading . Keep loses small so you don’t get knocked out of the 
trading game.  
It is imperative that a trader understand how to manage their risk. With 
proper risk management, a trader can have more losing trades than 
winning trades. As long as the winnin g trades are bigger than the losing 
trades they will still make a lot of money.  
Being a good trader is about making money day after day. Never losing 
a lot, losing only a little and not losing often. A trader wants to make 
money often and make a lot when h e does. How does a trader do this? 
They look for quality trades. It is not just about looking for something to 
trade for the sake of trading. It is about spotting quality trades and taking 
them. It is not always about getting the big homerun trade every ti me. It 
Page 117 of 150 
 
is about consistency. If you are not consistent your capital will slowly 
erode and when the big homerun trade comes you won’t be able to 
capitalize on it.  
The size of a move is nearly impossible to predict until it happens. Don’t 
spend all your time  trying to hit home run trades. Look for low risk high 
probability trades that give you an edge and aim for profits of all sizes. 
The setup s I have laid out for you in this book will sometimes result in a 
big move, sometimes a small profit or a small loss.  
An often overlooked part of trading/money management is a trader’s 
own pain threshold. This is the level where a loss starts to have an 
emotional impact on a trader. Knowing your pain threshold will reduce 
the emotionality in your trading decisions. If you r monetary threshold is 
10 ticks but your stop level is 20 ticks away you will find yourself wanting 
to get out of trades too early because you are afraid of losing more. This 
will have an adverse effect on your winning trades.  
The worst enemy you can have  marketwise is the desire to make the 
market do what you want it to do. Your wishes don’t count. The market 
has a job to do and does that job in its own way.  If you feel that you are 
wrong just get out of the trade.  
You have to determine the price you wan t to pay , the level you want to 
get in.  If you miss a trade don’t chase it, you will lower your profit 
potential and the  reason for getting into a trade may have passed  or the 
market conditions changed . The markets provide trading opportunities 
everyday se veral times a day. Missing a trade is not the end of the 
world.  There will be many more trades in the future.  
A mistake traders make is getting into a trade and waiting for the marke t 
to react and then it doesn’t do anything, it just range trades , in and out of 
profit for a while. When you have a setup based on certain criteria and 
the market doesn’t react the way it is supposed to that is a clear sign to  
get out or reduce the size of the position to minimize the risk . If a lot of 
time has elapsed and the position is not in the money, the chances of it 
going into the money are getting reduced with each second of the clock. 
Traders sit and wait for a breakout when there is no breakout occurring. 
If the breakout is not there, get out and prepare for the next trade 
opportunity. Don’t marry a trade that is going nowhere hoping that it will 
Page 118 of 150 
 
finally turn and go your way. You will miss the other trades that are 
setting up. After a while if a trade is not developing as planned you have 
to start thinking of bailing o ut of the trade as the reason for getting into 
the trade may have changed.  
An over looked form of stop is a time stop. Most people think of stops in 
terms of price, if the market moves against them a certain amount they 
get out. A time stop is based on tim e. When a trader gets into a position 
but the market just range trades and goes nowhere over a long period of 
time, the reasons for taking the trade in the first place have diminished 
because the market is not moving. It would be wise to get out and 
reasse ss the market as opposed to having a position on and being 
married to it. A trader can think more clearly without a position on than 
with a position on going nowhere or even slightly against him.  
There is a luck factor involved in trading. Anything can hap pen on any 
given day. There are going to be times when you join the sellers and you 
are the last seller and you sell the exact low and the market turns and 
rallies against you. There are going to be times when everything looks 
perfect, you get in and the m arket moves but only a 8 or 9 points and 
your target is 10 points. You miss your target by one point before it 
moves against you never to return. There is nothing you can do about it 
because you cannot will the market to move the extra tic. There will be 
days when you can do nothing wrong. You get short the market and it 
just falls out of bed and you make a ton of money. Luck goes both ways.  
Retail traders think that they can hide behind support and resistance 
levels. That if they place their stops behind s upport and resistance levels 
their los ses will be minimal. But the reality is that many professional 
traders know where these levels are go look for them to trade around 
because that is where the volume will be.  
The most important question when deciding to  enter a trade is “what risk 
am I getting into with this trade?” Most new traders read a few books on 
trading and the books all tell you that you can manage your risks by 
using stops. But what they don’t tell you in the books is that stops will 
help you ge t out of a position but there is no guarantee you get out at 
your desired level. The market can blow right through your level and you 
Page 119 of 150 
 
can be filled at a price much worse than your desired exit level.  Using 
stops is not risk management.   
There is a lot of n onsense in the market when it comes to stops. While I 
agree that stops should always be used, as traders are wiped out not by 
taking relatively small repeated loses, rather traders are wiped out by 
taking an occasional big loss. A good stop loss point shou ld be part of 
your trading plan and decided upon before any trade is entered. You 
need to be willing to get out of a trade when the reason for being in the 
trade in the first place is no longer valid. Saying that you have to use a 
hard and firm 10 point st op or something like that on every single trade 
is wrong.  Yes, you do need a point at which you have to get out of a 
trade no matter what. But a trader will realize that when the conditions 
change that they need to get out.  
The most important factor for c hoosing a stop loss level is actually very 
simple. It should be the price level that would indicate that the setup has 
become invalid. This should be common sense. If you get into a position 
based on a bullish setup, where would the price need to go to inv alidate 
the setup?  
Getting stopped out of trades too often  is a sign that your stops are too 
tight. You may think having tight stops make you a prudent trader but 
you are actually increasing your risk and the chances of getting stopped 
out. Trades need a little room. You should look to place your stop at a 
place where there is a structural reason. Not a hard and fast one size fits 
all type of stop. You should not be getting stopped out too often. If you 
are always getting stopped out, it is a sign that you  still have a lot to 
learn. You should be getting out under your own power and decisions.  
When I first started trading, I swear that I thought I was psychic or 
something for getting out or setting my stop right at the exact level that 
the stop gets elected  then the market dramatically turns around and 
goes directly to my profit level.  Order flow footprint charts give me better 
stop locations.  
Remember that not all trades work. Although the probabilities are greatly 
in your favour that the trade will be succ essful, there is also the small 
probability that th e trade will fail. If a trade does not work out that doesn’t 
mean that the analysis was incorrect. There may have been a change in 
Page 120 of 150 
 
market sentiment from the time the trade was established. With order 
flow analysis you will be able to detect the changes and exit the trade.  
Think like a boxer. A boxer is not going to win a fight unless he can take 
a lot of hits. When you see a boxer getting punched it doesn’t mean that 
he is going to lose the fight. It is his  ability to absorb the hits and come 
back and be aggressive and punch back at the right times that 
determines if he will win or lose.  
A lot of self -proclaimed trading gurus tell you that once you are in a 
position and that it starts moving in your favour t hat you should move 
your stop to break even. The problem with this is that when you are 
trading around a level, especially a macro level, there will be a lot of tug 
of war going on between buyers and sellers. If you are convinced in your 
method of trading you have to give your trades a chance to get to your 
level. One of the worst feelings as a trader is knowingly leaving money 
on the table by moving your stop to break even too soon.   
There is a saying “You will never go broke taking profits.” But the secon d 
line should be “You will never get rich getting out of trades early.” Taking 
small profits is the surest way to ultimate losses as small profits are 
never allowed to develop in full size or even enormous profits.  
A trader does not need to worry so much a bout their stops getting 
elected when they have a better read on the directional bias, or better 
entry level or market timing. When a trader stops following the same old 
technical analysis that everyone else does and starts looking at market 
structure then  they don’t have to worry about their stops so much.  
Your decision to get out of a position means that you think the market 
conditions have changed. When you are in a position your thoughts will 
be biased to support your position. You must remember the rea son for 
getting i nto a trade in the first place and respect it. If the reason for 
entering into a trade has disappeared and you are still in the trade, then 
you are just looking to lose money.  
Once you have decided to get out of a trade, don’t think you ca n pick a 
price level to get out at, just get out and take a fresh look at the market. 
Every now and then you may be able to pick up a few extra ticks here 
and there trying to pick a level to get out at, but more often than not the 
Page 121 of 150 
 
market will move away fro m you and then you will end up taking a full 
loss at your stop level just because you tried to save a few extra ticks.  
Exits are the most important half of the trading equation because where 
you get out of a trade determines your profits and losses. So don ’t take it 
lightly. Most traders are focused on the trade entry and not so much on 
the exit.  
  
Page 122 of 150 
 
PROPER TRADE EXECUTION  
Proper trade execution is the ability to act on an opportunity the moment 
you identify it. While it is easy to look at a chart after the f act and say 
that you would have sold here or bought there, the fact is that it is easier 
said than done.  
There are no guaranteed outcomes when it comes to trading. Every time 
you enter into a position, you put your money at risk. But traders  want 
guarantee d outcomes and that is why they hesitate to put on a position 
or get out of a position.  
When you enter a trade or are in a trade it is because of a conscious 
decision you made about the state of supply and demand. Unlike 
gambling, where the result is random and not based on your analysis, 
when you lose a bet at a casino you accept it because it is random. 
When you are in a trade and it is losing money you start to second 
guess yourself and take on additional stress.  
Proper trade execution is the ability to remove the second guessing and 
act accordingly when you see a trade to get in and manag e a trade once 
you are in it and exit the trade when it is time to exit.

PYSCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF TRADING  
There is more than money involved in trading. Your trading can have an 
effect on your life  without you even knowing it . Trading affects your 
mood, trading  affects your appetite,  trading  affects your relationships.  
When you are maki ng money, the world is perfect and you have it in the 
palm of your hand. But when you lose money your stomach can tighten, 
your temper can shorten or worse.  
As a trader you  want to make money every day. Setting an easy 
attainable goal will help a trader’s confidence.  People start trading 
because they want to make money. Too often when new traders start 
out they want to make big money right away. They want to make a 
million d ollars this year starting with an account of $50k. That is not 
really an attainable goal. It is just not realistic. Start with a daily goal of 
$250 or $500.  Once you are able to reach your daily goal you can 
always increase it and build on it from there. For example if the goal is 
20 ticks, once 20 ticks is reached, you can pause and determine if you 
still want to continue trading for the day. On good trading days you can 
make 100 or 500 ticks. But if it was a struggle to make the 20 ticks you 
may want to s top and take a breather. If you are down 20 ticks it is a 
sign that things are not going right. You need to reduce your size , pay 
closer attention to what the market is telling you. If you just can’t get into 
positive territory it may be time to stop tradi ng for the day.  
By having an easy attainable daily goal you can start to string together 
winning streaks. Psychologically speaking, once you are able to put 
together winning streak it will help you mentally when you think back on 
them. “I made money 8 days  in a row. I made money 22 days in a row.” 
It gives you the confidence when you have a losing day. It is like what 
recovering alcoholics go through in rehab. They try and get through the 
next hour without a drink, then the next day, then days become weeks,  
weeks become months. Winning days become weeks, weeks become 
months, months become years.  
The market will still be here tomorrow so don’t feel that you have to 
wrestle it to the ground all in one day. Just like with sports, the champion 
doesn’t win the le ague by pounding the other team in just one match. It 
is a series of matches over a period of time by which the champion is 
decided.  
Page 124 of 150 
 
Consistency is the key to success  as a trader for most traders. Sure 
there are some traders out there that will have 9 out of 10 trades that are 
losers but the 10th trade covers all 9 losers and makes a lot of money. 
Most traders would be so emotionally drained suffering through 9 
consecu tive losses that by the time the 10th trade came along they might 
not see it all the way through and close it out early with only a small win. 
That takes discipline and understanding one’s own trading ability.  
Huge winning trades will come, but the problem  is you do not know 
when they will come. You need to be prepared mentally as well as 
financially to take advantage of when they come instead.  
It is important to understand your own trading personality. Every trader is 
different and it affects the profits a nd losses. Can you take big losses in 
return for big winners? Or are you willing to take a series of small losses 
and small winners? Are you comfortable trading on small time frames of 
1 to 2 minutes or would you rather trade with a 60 minute or even daily  
chart s? You need to find your comfort zone as a trader.

OVERTRADING  AND GREED  
Overtrading has been the downfall of many traders over the years. 
There are many reasons for overtrading , the main one i s greed. Being 
greedy is easy. After a few profitable trades you start to think trading is 
easy and take borderline trades  that don’t exactly fit your criteria, but are 
close enough  to meeting your trade requirements even though they don’t 
really qualify  but you take them anyway because  you think you can 
make more money. Another example would be when y ou increase your 
order size even though your recent trades have been losers but you 
want to try and make back your losses by booking smaller gains  or 
thinking that by adding more contracts you can cover back your losses 
quicker . A lot of traders will  average down their losing trades with 
additional trades. The “I am right and the market is wrong” trade. You 
get angry at the market and take it person ally. Never rationalize losing 
money with your need to make money.  
It is easy to think you can get more money out of a trade when it is 
moving in your favour. But that is feeling is wishful thinking, it is not 
based on any factor. Wishful thinking in the market will not make you 
money on a consistent basis.  When you are up 5 points in a trade and 
that is your price target, don’t all of a sudden think you can squeeze out 
an extra point.   
Boredom is also a cause for overtrading. Some people have a  need for 
action. Don’t  trade for excitement. The market is not your casino. When 
you gamble and win, it might be because you had a gut feeling or were 
just plain lucky. If you start trading based on your gut feeling or relying 
on luck the n you are not trading, you are gambling.  
Basically you have taken your trading plan and thrown it out the window. 
Stick to your trading plan.  Overtrading is one of the fastest ways to blow 
up an account.

SITTING OUT  IS A TRADE  
I have spent most of this book talking about getting into and out of 
trades. But there are a lot of times when you are not in a trade and that 
is a trade  in itself . Knowing when not to trade is just as important as 
knowing when to trade. I am sure you have heard the phrase “trade with 
the trend.” Well what do you suppose you do when there is no trend? Sit 
on the side  lines and wait for the market to show you it is trending.  
It takes discipline, but if there is no reason to be in a trade, then you 
should not be in a trade.  
There are going to be days when you can do nothing right in the market. 
These are the days when you can’t get into a winning trade to save your 
life. When the market is acting unpredictably, by that I mean your entry 
setups are failing one after another, then you know the market is not 
actin g as it normally does and you should sit out for a while. It could be 
due to lack of liquidity and the market can move faster and farther on 
small volume. It could be that a big position is being unwound and the 
player isn’t so concerned about price – they just want out.  
  
Page 127 of 150 
 
CONFLICTING SIGNS  
The market will do what it wants to do. One thing traders cannot predict 
is what other traders will do. I don’t mean finding a level where there 
may be some big stops are than can be run or where there may be size 
in the order book. What I mean is a trader has no idea if or when an 
institutional player may change their thinking about supply and demand 
or when a participant needs to do an arb trade or hedge a physical sale.  
When you starting thinking the market must do wh at you think it will do 
based on your analysis you will become doomed when the market starts 
to move against you.  For example, say you got short because you read 
the market as being heavily sold based on your analysis. The market 
drops a few ticks, then t he market shows aggressive buying coming in 
during the same bar. Your original read says the market will go down, 
but it is not really dropping and you ignore the signals that are showing 
the market is poised for a rally because you are already in a positi on. 
This is a conflicting signal.  
If you weren’t in a trade and were looking at a chart the next day you 
would probably say to yourself that you would have passed on both 
trades since they were conflicting or you would think to yourself that it is 
obvious  that you would have taken the trade that worked. But since you 
find yourself in the trade you might miss or dismiss the change in the 
market and hope the market continues in the direction of your original 
trade.  
It is OK to be wrong about the market. But it is not OK to be wrong about 
the market direction and ignore the signs that it is time to get out of the 
position. Your read of the market can be wrong just as easily as it can be 
right. You have to accept that you will be wrong.  
Being a successful trade r is much more difficult than it appears. 
Experience is a long process of watching the markets and learning to 
recognize situations as they appear.  
Here is a  chart of what I mean by conflicting signs. You get into a 
position based on what the market is te lling you  but then you get a signal 
that the market conditions have changed. It can either be the setup is 
invalidated or another trade setup in the opposite direction.  
Page 128 of 150 
 
 
In this example, we got long based on a series of small prints, but just 2 
bars later before the market got to my take profit area a setup in the 
other direction appears. You have 3 choices. You can either start getting 
out of your position, wait for the m arket to either hit your profit target or 
you stop loss  or flip your position. This is where reading the market via 
the order flow is useful. In the above example, I chose to scale out rather 
than flip my position because the even through there was a sell set up, I 
felt there was support in the market with the stacked buying imbalaces. 
So I didn’t feel like the market was ready for a big sell off, I thought it will 
trade lower and range trade for a while.

COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF A TRADING OPPORTUNITY  
Trading opportunities arise when you can identify market developments 
as they are occurring. Any form of market analysis is only useful in as 
much as it is readable and reliable. T rading opportunities need to be 
easily recognizable and determine market dir ection.  Order flow allows 
me to quickly see opportunities developing and keep an eye on them as 
they develop so as to be ready to trade them when they can be 
confirmed.  
I have a basic set of criteria, so to speak, that I adhere to when looking 
over the mar kets before getting into a trade on either the buy side or the 
sell side. If these basic criteria can’t be met then chances are the trade 
opportunity is not there.  
What I look for in BUYS  
 A closed footprint with positive delta.  
 A closed footprint where the  candlestick was green (up).  
 Evidence within the bar that buyers have aggressively bought the 
seller’s offers at subsequently higher prices.  
 Significantly higher volume traded on the offer than the bid.  
What I look for in SELLS  
 A closed footprint with nega tive delta.  
 A closed footprint where the candlestick was red (down)  
 Evidence within the bar that sellers have aggressively sold into the 
buyer’s bid at subsequently lower prices.  
 Significantly higher volume traded on the bid than the offer.  
 
The best buy s ignal s are when a market starts to move up and showing 
buying imbalances while the market is breaking  out of the accumulation 
stages as noted by signs of absorption.  The shift from adequate supply 
to stronger demand is happening in the market place  and tre nds can 
start. 
The best sell signals are when a market starts to move down out of an 
area of absorption and showing selling imbalances. Sellers are 
Page 130 of 150 
 
overwhelming the buyers with excess supply. When a market starts to 
drop due to excess supply it can drop ve ry fast.  
Not every trading opportunity is going to look exactly alike. The volume 
numbers will vary, the aggressive participant’s position in a bar will vary, 
the location of the COT will vary. What will remain the same is the 
concept behind the setup.  
Being a successful trader is much more difficult than it appears. 
Experience is a long process of watching the markets and learning to 
recognize situations as they appear.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER  
I have explained a lot in this book and shown many different examples.  
What I am going to show you is how I put it all together to get make a 
trading decision. There are many different styles of trading the futures 
markets and no one style is right or wro ng. What I am showing you is 
how I trade. What I have to say may either make total sense to you and 
be similar to how you already trade or I may make no sense to you 
whatsoever and you will think I am a crackpot. I am not saying my way is 
the best way for you to trade, but it just happens to be what works best 
for me.  
These trade setups have a very high probability of success. They may 
not occur every day but they happen enough to put up some impressive 
profits. I use these set up in all major futures m arkets: ES, YM, ZN, 6E 
ZC and many more.  
A major problem that many traders have is too many indicators that their 
screen is so cluttered that it is difficult to make a decision because one 
indicator says buy and another one says sell. I like to keep my screen  
clean so it is easy to see trade setups as they are happening.  
Traders often get caught up using complex technical indicators that are 
based on price to try and predict the market movements. What they tend 
to forget is that the main driver of price direct ion comes down to simple 
supply and demand. If we see demand for a product, service, 
commodity, or currency accelerate, we will begin to see increasing 
prices for that product. Economists call it “The LAW of Demand”, not the 
“theory of demand”, or th e “ide a of demand”. The Law of D emand  and 
the Law of Supply,  like the Law of Gravity is a proven concept.  
I will show you how supply and demand affects price and how to use 
order flow to predict market moves that would otherwise not be noticed 
with traditional charting methods.  
The main focus of this book is to show you how I identify hidden trading 
opportunities that have low risk entries. The techniques here are the 
simplest and most direct that can easily be seen with order flow footprint 
charts.  
Page 132 of 150 
 
This set up  can be traded on just about ANY futures market with decent 
volume and ANY intraday time frame or range or volume chart.  
Take a look at the bar chart below. Can you tell by looking at the 
candlesticks that the market was ready to turn around? It is easy to  look 
back at a chart well after the fact and say “oh yeah, the market looked 
like it was ready to turn around.” But why would you say that? Is there 
any evidence other than the bar closed lower  than where it opened? It 
couldn’t even close lower  than the p revious low. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Page 133 of 150 
 
Now look at the Order flows chart :  
 
Do you see that big red number at the top ? That is a buying  imbalance 
greater than 400%. 546 traded on the offer at 1938.25, in the previous 
bar there were 182 lots that traded at the same price and 681 traded just 
below at 1938 . These are traders who got into the move at the very end. 
These could be traders who tried to push the market higher  to continue 
its upward  move. It doesn’t really matter what the people were thinking 
that bought that high . Someone has to buy the high . 
What is important is that we have an imbalance at a recent high. It 
doesn’t need to be the high of the day, it can be the high of a swing 
move. You have all these people that bought at the high  and the market 
couldn’t go any higher. 
So how do we trade this?  
1. You see a  selling imbalance at the top on a high . I like the 
imbalance to occur at the high of the bar rather than the second or 
third price from the high like in the previous bar.  

Page 134 of 150 
 
2. The bar closed lower  than the open so we see that there was 
some selling  pressure to cause the market to drop. If there are 
some selling  imbalances in the bar, even better, but it is not 
necessarily needed.  
3. Wait for confirmation of the high by waiting for the bar to close. 
There will be times when it  looks like you have a set up and want 
to get in early but the bar hasn’t closed yet and the market 
reverses and the setup is erased and you are in a position you 
shouldn’t be in.  
4. Choose your entry. There are many ways you can enter. You can 
just enter at the market once the next bar has begun. You can try 
and scale in the length of the setup bar, but you run the risk of 
missing the trade when it just shoots straight up. The way I trade it 
is I like to get involved no matter what, so I will sell 2 contracts  at 
the market then I will scale the rest in between the low and high of 
the setup bar in case there is a retracement. Sometimes there are 
retracements and sometimes not. I like to try to get in also during a 
retracement by working a limit order around the  middle of the bar.  
5. Place your stop. I like to place my stop 2 ticks above  the selling 
imbalance price in the setup bar just to give it some room. This is 
more generous than I really should. You can place your stop at the 
imbalance price or a tick below it  since that would invalidate the 
set up. Once in while price does go back up to retest the high 
before going lower . In this example, I would have placed my stop 
at 1938.25 . 
6. Take profit level. You can be either mechanical or discretionary in 
deciding where to get out. In the ES I will put in a take profit level 5 
points away . Once I get into a position I monitor it and see if the 
conditions change. If they do I just get out. For example I may get 
a setup in the opposite direction.  
As you will see there will be some trades that seem so obvious they are 
“slam dunks.” These are the trades with high probability, low risk and 
high reward.  
I like setups that generate signals with winners that are at least twice the 
size of losses and a minimum 50% winning average, however, I have 
that 60%+ winning averages are optimum and realistic.  
Page 135 of 150 
 
Once your entry setups have be defined, don’t fiddle around with them 
trying to make them marginally better. What you should do is focus your 
attention and work on making you exits bette r. 
You can pick tops and bottoms and have a high success rate if you are 
quick to realize when you are wrong. You won’t be getting in at the exact 
low, but pretty darn close, usually in the next bar.  
Not all trading opportunities occur near the highs and lows. Often times 
a move can happen when the market is range trading. Trends come out 
from periods of consolidation.  
 

Page 136 of 150 
 
 
This is a trade that is you will only find with order flow analysis. It won’t 
show up on a traditional bar chart. You need to look insi de of the actual 
bar to see what is trading to fully understand the market. The battle 
between buyers and sellers is constantly going on. When one side starts 
to take over that is the side you want to be on.  

Page 137 of 150 
 
 
What I like about these trade setups  is that t hey provide low risk entries 
to the market because you know exactly where you want to get out if the 
trade breaks down. Not adhering to a defined money management stop 
is the most common cause of failure among traders.  
The great set -ups like these are not something that just happens once in 
a while, but almost every day. Some days there might be only one or two 
trading opportunities. Some days there might be none.  
As I mentioned in the beginning, order flow footprint trading is not for 
everyone. But I thin k it is a useful skill and tool for traders to learn and 
understand.  
The downside of order flow trading is that it can be a labo ur intensive 
style of trading. Depending on your time frame you may end up 
spending a good deal of your time paying attention t o the order flow as it 
occurs.  
You should try to avoid the marginal trades and concentrate on the good 
set-ups.  

Page 138 of 150 
 
Each day in the market is different. Some days the market will have 
periods of choppy trading followed by slightly larger trends. On other 
days the market will trade in one direction most of the day. While some 
days will be more challenging than others, you should still have 
profitable days using these set -ups. 
So there you have it –simple, easy to understand setup s.  
A key point to keep in mind  is that order flow trading is not an exact 
science. You still need to trade in the direction of the market and be 
flexible.  
At first sight, the details of trading off of order flow and foot print charts 
may seem laborious. Over time, as you get more comfo rtable with what 
to look for in the order flow you will find yourself making more high 
probability trades.  
Successful traders are patient and disciplined. Successful trading begins 
in your mind. Develop patience and disciple if you want to be successful. 
You might ask me why does patience play such an important role in 
trading? In order to answer that question, you should look at and 
compare the different ways that institutional traders and retail traders do 
their trading . Generally speaking, retail have sh orter time frames to hold 
losing positions because they tend to be leveraged more than 
institutional traders and just don’t have the financial resources to take 
too much heat when a position goes against them.  
Remember the best traders always trade when t hey feel they have an 
edge to put the odds in their favour and they trade for one reason only 
and that is to make money. They don’t trade simply because the market 
is open and they have a need for action. They have discipline.  
Just wait for the right setup  whenever it happens and take what the 
market gives you. After all that is the nature of trading – taking what the 
market gives you.  
Before you get too excited: These setups, while impressive, ARE NOT 
the Holy Grail traders are always looking for. The nic e thing about order 
flow set ups is that they have their own built in stop loss i.e. your stop 
loss is basically the high or low of the set up bar.

HOW I USE ORDERFLOWS SOFTWARE TO FIND TRADES  
The following are some examples of trades I have taken. All of  them 
incorporated Orderflows techniques. Since I trade futures, the examples 
are futures oriented. Also, my basis is short term so the examples will be 
based off of intra -day charts. I believe each person has their own unique 
trading style. How you trade is different than how I trade . You probably 
don’t have the same thought process as I do.  
The purpose of this chapter is not to give you a firm set of rules for 
taking trades. It is to show you how to incorporate order flow into your 
trading. Hopefully by s eeing the examples here, you will have a better 
understanding of using order flow in your trading.  
There are several types of setups that I am always on the lookout for:  
1. A small print / single print high or low that occurs at a low or a high. 
I also look f or a small print / print that occurs just after a high or 
low. For buys the print should occur on the bottom of a bar that 
closed higher. For sells it should occur at the top of a bar that 
closed lower. The single print should be between 1 and 9. The 
ratio for a small print and single print should be greater than 28 at 
the minimum. I am not interested in a single print of say 2 lots 
when the next number is 5 lots. I want the small print to be 
because there was just no more buying or selling interest, not 
because of low volume.  
2. A market that is bottom heavy or top heavy. This is a variation of a 
large print. This occurs when the extreme bottom or top print is 
much greater than the next print. For example 
96 and 15, 53 and 16.   The reason I like to 
look for these big prints on the lows or highs 
of the bar is it indicates to me that there are 
either a strong buyer or seller that came into 
the market with a big bid or offer. This caused 
the other participants to scramble and try and 
jump ahead of the larger orders. I have the 
ratio set to 0.699 and below, meaning the 
extreme print is 69.9% greater than the next 
print.  

Page 140 of 150 
 
 
3. Trapped selling imbalances at highs or 
trapped buying imbalances at lows. This 
marked with a green arrow when it  is a 
trapped buying imbalance and a red 
arrow if it is a trapped selling imbalance.  
If there is a confluence with another 
setup, for example a small or single print 
or a top or bottom heavy print then that 
gives me a little more incentive to take 
the trad e setup. I prefer to see trapped 
buyers on or near the low and trapped 
sellers on or near the high.  
 
4. Orderflows divergence. The Orderflows divergence is a little 
different than the other divergence indicators out there. It is 
marked on the screen with a g reen triangle for a bullish divergence 
setup and a red arrow for a bearish divergence setup. What makes 
the Orderflows divergence setup different is that we require an 
extra confirmation that the market has turned. For a bullish 
divergence setup we require  the market to make or equal a new 
low, have positive delta and the bar to close higher relative to 
where it opened. For a bearish divergence setup we require the 
market to make or equal a new high, have negative delta and the 
bar to close lower relative t o its open. Most order flow divergence 
signals only require a new or equal high and negative delta or a 
new or equal low and positive delta. By qualifying the bar close 
relative to its open we have eli minated a lot of false signals which 
can occur when the re is absorption, a lot of two way trade going on 
at a high or low. We need to see price move as well.
 

Page 141 of 150 
 
So let’s now take a look at the setups as they occur so that you can 
better understand how to apply them in your trading. Setups are like 
snowflakes, no  two are exactly the same although they may look similar.  
This first chart I call being Top Heavy In CL. One of the indicators of 
Orderflows software is that it for a down candlestick it takes the top two 
numbers and divides them and for an up candlestick it takes the top two 
numbers and divides them then plots the ratio number below for a bar 
that closes lower and below for a bar that closes higher. I have the 
software set so that when the ratio is below 0.69 it will print the ratio in 
BLUE ; meaning, for a  down bar, that the second number is much less 
than the top number.  
 
In this case, at point A, when you divide 80 into 26 you get  0.325. This is 
important because it indicates there was more volume traded on the 
offer at the high than the level just below it. In theory it should be less, as 
you get higher in price the buying should be less before prices decline. 
The indication here is that there is a seller willing to step in at this level 
with supply.  

Page 142 of 150 
 
At point B, we also see a bar where the top number is greater than the 
number beneath it. This bar is a doji in Japanese candlestick terms and 
is a sign of market indecision. The Order flows software does not mark 
ratios on doji candlesticks because I have found that the market could 
really go either way.  
At point C, there is yet another ratio. This time it is 0.2559 . Which 
indicates to me that the bar has a top number much greater than the 
number just below it. This indicates to me that there is ample supply in 
the market and that every time the market tries to go higher someone 
comes in and offers their supply for sale.  
The market sold off from the 39.45 level to the 38.90 level.  
I have  the ratio set to 0.699 or less. Ideally I like to see a number below 
0.50 which would indicate that the extreme number is a minimum twice 
as big as the next number. However, it is not set in stone. I can’t say that 
it only works if it is 0.50 or below. I execute my discretion for ratios 
between 0.699 and 0.50 because I also take into account the volume 
that actually trades. You could have a ratio of 0.20 which would look 
good but the volumes involved might only be 1 lot and 5 lots which is 
hardly convincin g. This is why I don’t create a bot to trade this. I like to 
see the ebb and flow of the market. I am the trader, not the computer.

The next chart highlights the Single Print High set up. It occurs when 
there is a single print in volume (volume of  9 or less) at a high or low.  
The Orderflows software draws a red box if there is a single print in a bar 
that closes down or a green box if the bar closes up. Also the ratio is 
printed above or below the bar if it is greater than 28. Ideally the bigger 
the number the more powerful it signal.  
 
This single print is off the Richter scale. It measures 1805. In the interest 
rate futures you do tend to get big ratio numbers like that. When I see 
big ratios like that I look to get short as soon as the bar closed . This was 
on a 15 minute chart. The market could not even print more than the 1 
lot when it traded that level. It could have been some algo buying the 1 
lot to see if there are any stops there. Earlier it traded there for 1383 lots, 
but on the retest only  one person was interested in paying that high.  
This next chart is a variation on the Single Print High. I call it the Small 
Print High. It occurs when the ratio between the top and second to top 
number is greater than 28. Sometimes the market just pushes through a 
level but can’t go any higher because all the buyers are exhausted. The

only traders who will see this trade are those who are trading order flow. 
The re st of the world won’t notice it, they will just see a big down bar.  
 
There is also something else in this chart that is quite powerful to trade 
with. When you look at bar A, you see two buying imbalances in the 
candlestick wick and selling imbalances in the body. That tells me the 
sentiment has changed in the market as the bar was forming. The bar 
opened up with some strong aggressive buying , but the market just 
couldn’t carry through and strong aggressive selling came in. So, with 
the small print high and the imbalances this is a strong indicat ion for the 
market to sell off.

In the next chart we have t wo setups  occurring at the same time  - 
confluence . There is a Trapped Selling Imbalance and a ratio trade.  
 
I like it when there are two setups in a bar. It gives me more confidence 
in taking the trade, although it is no guarantee that the trade will work.  
Ok, so here we have a selling imb alance on a low of a bar where the bar 
closed higher and there are some buying imbalances in the body, just 
barely, but still near the opposite end of the bar. Also the ratio between 
the bottom number of 113 and the second number of 78 is 0.6903 just 
barel y under the ratio of 0.699. This is why I like to include between 
0.699 and 0.50, so I can eyeball it and make my own decision to take 
the trade or not. 113 lots at the low in the Crude Oil is a decent number.  
I really think that as a trader you have to kn ow how to read the signals. 
Just because a set up occurs doesn’t mean you have to take it, if the 
volume doesn’t look right then you can pass.

Let’s now take a look at an Orderflows divergence trade. The problem 
with divergence that I had in the past was when the market was trending 
you could get a lot of divergences appearing on the way up when the 
market constantly is making new highs throughout the trading day or 
new lows. After seeing the problem with a trending market and 
divergence I came to the conc lusion that price also has to start moving 
away from the high or low for it to be a valid divergence.  
The beauty of this setup is that the stop placement is just behind the 
high or the low. As you can see you can catch some nice moves. But 
remember that y ou can also get chopped up in a one way street type of 
trending market.  
Orderflows divergence is a powerful setup because it occurs at the day’s 
low or high. If institutions are bullish on the market, they will support the 
market which entails them to buy at or near the low. If institutions are 
bearish, they will need to sell at or near the high so the market doesn’t 
go higher.

WRAP UP  
No matter what kind of trader you are, there are certain basics common 
to the markets which will ultimately determine whether you make money 
or lose money. There are books, videos, websites, training courses from 
many different sources which promise you the easy road to trading 
success. I will tell you right now that there is no easy mechanical way to 
trade and win consis tently. The markets are always changing . Factors 
that move the markets are always changing. It is not really that tough, it 
just takes some time and patience and practice on your part to become 
a profitable trader.  
A study of order flow  reveals patterns th at occur again and again. The 
overall trend will be either up or down regardless of the number of 
changes in direction within the period. Once a trend has been 
determined, ride along with it. If there is a signal that the trend is starting 
to head  the othe r way, jump off and prepare yourself  for the next turn. 
Trying to go against the trend is like trying to swim up river against the 
flow of water.  
Once you start to learn to read what the market is telling you, it is then 
that you can see patterns emerge, i f there is a pattern. Most of the time 
there is no discernible pattern. The market is facilitating trade just as it is 
supposed to.  
Nothing is certain in trading. Fundamentals  and technicals  can change 
at any time during a trade. There are a multitude of u ncertain factors that 
can make short term price swing occur s. Option hedging, delta 
positioning, portfolio adjustments, risk on -risk off trades,  a FED official 
speaking,  etc. All these things and more will affect your position. With 
order flow  analysis you can see what is developing in real time and react 
to it as it is happening.  
There is a time to buy and a time to sell. No set formula is infallible. But 
knowing how to interpret order flow  is invaluable in minimizing your 
losses and making your trades mor e profitable.  
Practice, practice, practice. Get screen time. Pour over charts and look 
for instances where the market turned and try and understand what 
market forces were present that caused the move. Great atheletes 
spend hours and hours a day practicing . Guys like David Beckham or 
Page 148 of 150 
 
Cristiano Ronaldo take 100’s of practice shots from all over the field so 
during game time when they are in that situation they know exactly how 
to take that shot. They take the pressure of themselves since they know 
what to do . 
Once you finish reading this book, you will likely feel confident that you 
can successfully trade using order flow. In all likelihood you will because 
you will understand order flow better. But that doesn’t mean you should 
jump right in and start throwin g around size trades. You do need some 
practice first. Being able to read the charts in real time and being able to 
make trading decisions  on entering or exiting a trade  requires practice 
until it become almost second nature or in other words reactionary.   
The actual steps of entering a trade into a trading system may not seem 
all that important to your trading, but it is easy to make a mistake by 
clicking on the wrong price or quantity or even mix up a buy order with a 
sell order. Get practice entering ord ers yourself. It will serve you well in 
the future. Mistakes cost money. If you enter into a trade in error, just get 
out. Don’t try to finesse the error or scratch it. It can easily go from bad 
to worse and very quickly. Just chalk it up to experience and  don’t make 
the same mistake again.  
Really the only way to develop this intuition is by extensive practicing. 
After you have watched your real -time charts long enough and have 
witnessed many different types of set -ups as they happen, you will begin 
to unde rstand what the market is doing based on the order flow. This 
book will give you the knowledge about order flow trading, but you need 
to develop the experience of using this knowledge through actual trades.  
Remember there are 2 immutable laws in the market . As demand goes 
up, prices go up. As supply increases, prices go down.  
Congratulations on making it to the end of this book. Hopefully this isn’t 
“the end” for you, but rather just the beginning of trading with order flow. 
Now is the time for you to start  applying what you have learned. Watch 
the charts, do some trades and practice. Simply reading this book won’t 
transform you into a successful trader.  
Even though many of you will be using this book as a reference guide 
when it comes to order flow trading,  at least I hope you will, it doesn’t 
Page 149 of 150 
 
mean that everyone will use or der flow in the same way as I do. Some of 
you may incorporate only parts of what I have shown you here. Every 
trader has different idiosyncrasies and our risk tolerances differ.  
Some people are going to read this book and flat out tell me I am just 
wrong in my analysis of order flow or that order flow charts are nice but 
not really that important. I am fine with that. I don’t need everyone to 
agree with my way of trading the markets af ter all that is what gives me 
an edge in the market.  
Happy Trading.
