 1 Cryptocurrencies Market : A Basic Introduction  
Raja Nabeel -Ud-Din Jalal, PhD  
 
In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin, a peer -to-peer 
electronic transaction system that replaces paper and plastic money with 
crypto coins. The primary purpose of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency is to cut 
out the middleman, the financial institution, and reduce the costs incurred 
by using a financial institution for transactions and payments.  
Low transaction costs, peer -to-peer transaction networks,  and 
decreased user control have all increased the overall popularity of 
cryptocurrencies, resulting in an explosive increase in market size. The 
rapid growth that was triggered by this event has led to volatile market 
conditions, rapid market speculation,  and a group -think mentality in the 
market. The price of Bitcoin increased from $300 to $7,500 over the course 
 2 of 3 years before peaking in June of 2018. Frisby (2014)  claimed that it 
appears that Bitcoin exhibits the characteristics of money, while offering 
additional benef its. A lot of market traders find the supply and demand 
volatility it has, along with its resiliency, divisibility, portability, and liquidity, 
to be attractive (Jalal and Leonelli, 2020; Jalal et al. , 2020; Jalal, Alon and 
Paltrinieri, 2 021). 
Several new cryptocurrencies have emerged in a short period of 
time, most of which also rely on blockchain technology. Examples include 
Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP). Ethereum uses advanced hardware that 
reduces the time needed to process transa ctions. Ripple supports the free 
transfer of different currencies. Although there are no significant differences 
in these currencies' underlying technology, various characteristics of each 
currency may affect their value, stability, and relationship with o ther 
cryptocurrencies.  
 3 Bitcoin dominates the cryptocurrency market and is the world’s first 
digital currency. Between October 2016 and October 2017, blockchain's 
market capitalization grew from $10.1 billion to $79.7 billion, and prices have 
risen from $61 6 billion to $4800 billion (US dollars). This substantial 
increase of 680% gave investors returns per annum that no other 
investments could achieve.  Cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are 
commonly known as “Altcoins” (alternative coin). These altcoins ar e divided 
into two categories: (i) altcoin, which follows Bitcoin’s open -source protocols 
with minor changes in the underlying codes and (ii) independent source 
protocols with independent distributed ledgers. Litecoin is one of the major 
altcoins in the fi rst category, whereas Ethereum and Ripple are in the 
second category. Although altcoins are part of the cryptocurrency market, 
each of them has different characteristics. Some use Bitcoin protocols, and 
some use a completely different system, with centrali zed, decentralized, 
 4 pseudo -anonymous or completely anonymous PoW or PoS 
mechanisms (Jalal, Alon and Paltrinieri, 2021) .  Table 1 identifies the 
characteristics of the major cryptocurrencies. The top 10 of these such as 
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Stellar, IOTA, Cardano, 
Monero, NEO and DASH are decentralized. Most of them can be converted 
into stabl e fiat currencies. Most of these cryptocurrencies use smart 
contracts for security purposes to protect the users and are pseudo -
anonymous in nature.

 8 The lack of connectedness to any central or regional authority and ease of 
accessibility have made cryptocurrencies a global financial asset that can be 
accessed in multiple locations worldwide (Corbet et al. , 2019; Jalal, Alon and 
Paltrinieri, 2021) . The decentralized nature makes cryptocurrencies easy to invest in, 
hacking, theft, unethical use, and the  financing of terror are linked with 
cryptocurrencies and activities on the Dark Web. It would be interesting to see the 
impact of cryptocurrencies on market, and individual level.
