WEBSOCKET API
Websocket API will be available on 2025-02-25 and can be accessed through this URL:

orders and listening to market data requires two separate W ebSocket connections.
WebSocket API is subject to the same Filter and Rate Limit rules as REST API.
WebSocket API and REST API are functionally equivalent: they provide the same
