2. Introduction
 As we conclude an exceptionally eventful year in crypto, we think it’s a good time to reflect on the 
crypto ETP landscape and its unprecedented growth. With digital assets increasingly integrating 
into mainstream finance, crypto ETPs have become a crucial bridge between traditional 
investment solutions and the expanding cryptocurrency ecosystem.
As a global multi-asset market maker in both traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto assets, we 
strive to enhance market efficiency. In the crypto space particularly, we provide vital liquidity 
that drives a positive feedback loop of improved price discovery, enhanced user experience, and 
increased capital inflow. This influx of capital fuels innovation and experimentation, attracting 
more users and further investment. The past year’s developments have been highly consequential 
for the industry, opening floodgates for capital and bridging TradFi and crypto.
Looking ahead, we expect this trend to accelerate. The continued evolution of crypto ETPs is 
likely to further blur the lines between traditional and crypto market, potentially leading to more 
sophisticated products and increased institutional participation. As regulatory frameworks mature 
and market infrastructure improves, we also expect to see a new wave of innovation in crypto-
based financial products that achieve mass adoption. This evolution will allow us to bring the 
best of both worlds to facilitate the co-evolution of these ecosystems, and to reshape the global 
financial landscape in the coming years.
After eight months of range-bound price action, with the global crypto market capitalization 
fluctuating between $2 trillion and $2.9 trillion, the crypto market, led by Bitcoin (BTC), finally 
broke out of this range following President-elect Donald Trump’s re-election in the U.S. Year-over-
year, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has reached $3.18 trillion, a 140% increase, 
exceeding the 2021 all-time high, according to data from Coingecko.
As of the drafting date, year-to-date, BTC has increased 130% and Solana (SOL) has climbed 124%. 
Ethereum (ETH), however, has underperformed other majors, up 43%.
Several major themes have dominated the crypto landscape this year: President-elect Trump’s 
victory in the U.S. elections and the potential impact this will have on global crypto adoption and 
policy, the growing intersection of crypto and artificial intelligence, the ongoing institutional 
adoption driving market maturity, and the proliferation of meme coins. This report explores how 
2024 has, in many ways, become the year of the crypto ETP.
Prior to the summer of 2023, news and headline interest in crypto ETPs were relatively limited. 
Market interest was highly correlated with the slew of listings that appeared during 2021 market 
cycle. However, this pales in comparison to what has occurred since BlackRock filed for a spot 
Bitcoin ETF in June 2023. Since then, crypto ETPs, especially spot ETFs listed and traded on U.S. 
venues, have taken center stage in the market.

What are ETPs?
To better understand the significance 
of crypto ETPs and their impact on the 
financial landscape, it’s essential to first 
grasp the fundamentals of ETPs and their 
key characteristics.
ETPs are financial instruments that track 
underlying assets or indices and trade on 
stock exchanges like stocks. They include 
ETFs, Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs), and 
Exchange-Traded Commodities (ETCs), 
offering investors exposure to various asset 
classes and strategies in a single, tradable 
vehicle. 
What are the differences between ETFs, 
ETNs, and ETCs?
ETFs, ETNs, and ETCs are all types of ETPs 
with different structures and risk profiles. 
ETFs invest in a basket of securities, offering 
direct ownership and transparency. ETNs 
and ETCs can be secured or unsecured debt 
securities promising returns based on an 
index’s performance. ETCs are designed for 
commodity investments, often physically 
backed. In the case of both ETNs and ETCs, 
issuer risk a is key consideration.

5
What are the structural components of ETPs and how do they work together?
ETPs function through key structural components that work together to provide regulated 
exposure to various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. The main components are:
1.	
Underlying assets/index: What the ETP tracks (e.g., stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies) and
forms the basis for calculating the product’s net asset value (NAV)
2.	
Issuer: Develops, issues, and manages the ETP
3.	
Authorized Participants (APs): A financial institution which is authorized to create and
redeem shares
4.	
Custodian: Securely stores and manages the underlying cryptocurrency assets, if the ETP is
backed by in-kind assets
5.	
Creation/redemption mechanism: Allows authorized participants to provide liquidity,
maintain price alignment with the product’s NAV, and enables tracking with the
underlying index
6.	
Secondary market: Where investors trade ETP shares, and market makers provide liquidity
These components interact to allow investors easy access to underlying assets without direct 
ownership. APs create or redeem shares based on demand, helping align ETP prices with their 
NAV and providing accurate market exposure.
What are crypto ETPs?
Having briefly explored the key characteristics of ETPs, we now turn our attention to the crypto 
variant. These innovative financial instruments have emerged as a bridge between traditional 
finance and the cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering investors a familiar and regulated way to gain 
exposure to digital assets.
Building upon the previous sections, crypto ETPs are therefore financial instruments that track the 
performance of one or more cryptocurrencies and trade on traditional stock exchanges, allowing 
investors to gain exposure to digital assets without directly owning or managing them. These 
products can take the form of ETFs, ETNs, or ETCs, depending on their structure and regulatory 
environment, and they provide a regulated, accessible, and generally cost-efficient way for both 
retail and institutional investors to participate in the cryptocurrency market through their existing 
brokerage accounts and relationships.
While crypto ETFs have become the most popular vehicle, ETCs and ETNs were among the earliest 
accessible ways for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency price movements on traditional 
exchanges. Today, approximately 65 crypto ETCs with $10.7 billion in AUM and 32 crypto ETNs with 
$4.5 billion in AUM are actively traded on various exchanges. While these figures are relatively 
small compared to the global crypto ETP AUM of over $100 billion, they highlight the foundational 
role these early products played in bridging traditional markets and cryptocurrencies.

6
What makes crypto ETPs different?
Unlike conventional ETPs that track established asset 
classes, cryptocurrency ETPs are based on underlying 
assets which are known for their high volatility and 24/7 
trading. This necessitates specialized custody solutions 
and creates distinct challenges in pricing and liquidity 
management. The regulatory environment for crypto 
ETPs is also still evolving, varying across jurisdictions and 
often requiring new product structures to comply with 
existing frameworks while providing crypto exposure.
Furthermore, crypto ETPs introduce novel risk factors 
such as smart contract risk and network outages. 
However, they also offer unique opportunities, including 
the potential for additional returns through methods like 
staking or lending of the underlying crypto assets.
Ultimately, crypto ETPs play a crucial role in providing 
regulated market access for traditional investors, 
allowing them to gain exposure without directly 
handling wallets or engaging with crypto exchanges. 
This bridge between traditional finance and the crypto 
ecosystem makes crypto ETPs a distinct and evolving 
category within the broader ETP landscape.
How have ETPs evolved to include crypto-based products?
The evolution of ETPs to include crypto-based products has been a gradual process, marked 
by significant milestones and regulatory developments. This expansion reflects the growing 
acceptance of cryptocurrencies as an innovative asset class and the increasing demand from both 
retail and institutional investors for regulated exposures.
Over the past decade, ETPs have significantly expanded to include crypto-based offerings, evolving 
from traditional asset classes to encompass all manners of alternative investments, including 
cryptocurrencies. This evolution began with the launch of the first crypto ETP, the CoinShares XBT 
Bitcoin Tracker One in Sweden in 2015, and has since grown to include a diverse range of products 
tracking various tokens and indices, with over 730 active listings globally by the end of October 
2024, reflecting the increasing mainstream acceptance and regulatory adaptation to digital assets 
in the financial markets.

How do crypto ETPs address some of the challenges associated with direct cryptocurrency 
investment or exposure?
Crypto ETPs have emerged as an innovative solution for investors seeking exposure to 
cryptocurrencies. They provide several key advantages, including enhanced liquidity, seamless 
trading, and the benefit of regulatory oversight. Investors can trade these products during 
regular market hours through their existing brokerage accounts, benefiting from the established 
infrastructure of stock exchanges. This structure also facilitates portfolio diversification, with 
some ETPs offering exposure to multiple cryptocurrencies or specific themes within the crypto 
ecosystem.
Furthermore, crypto ETPs are subject to regulatory standards and compliance requirements, 
which may enhance investor protection and transparency. In major markets like the U.S. and 
EU, these products must adhere to strict regulations, including regular disclosures and robust 
risk management and governance protocols. Many jurisdictions also require institutional-grade 
custody, asset segregation, and regular audits. This regulated framework makes crypto ETPs a 
consideration for a wide range of investors, including those who may face restrictions on directly 
holding cryptocurrencies. As the crypto ETP market continues to evolve, it represents an important 
development in the integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems.
What are the key considerations for investors when evaluating crypto ETPs (e.g., expense ratios, 
tracking error, liquidity)?
When evaluating crypto ETPs, investors should consider several key factors:

3. Market Overview
 
Turning our attention towards the market, 2024 has been a year of unprecedented growth 
and transformation, with ETPs emerging as a key driver of institutional adoption and market 
accessibility. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the crypto ETP 
market, highlighting key trends, as well as regional and product dynamics.
As we delve into the data, we’ll explore how the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has 
reshaped the global landscape, shifting the balance of power in terms of AUM and trading volume 
across regions. We’ll also examine the distribution of assets across different underlying asset types.
Assets Under Management
Global AUM totaled approximately $134.5 billion in November 2024, up 950% from a year ago. Much 
of this surge has been driven by the introduction of spot ETFs in the U.S. after the SEC’s approval 
on January 10, 2024, a milestone that followed years of anticipation. Prior to this landmark event, 
the U.S. market featured alternative structures such as synthetic BTC ETFs, closed-end funds, and 
trust vehicles like Grayscale. These earlier products laid the groundwork for the rapid adoption and 
scaling of spot ETFs, also underscoring the maturity and resilience of the crypto ETP ecosystem. 
It’s worth mentioning that this was a development that was years in the making, with synthetic 
BTC ETFs, closed-end funds, trust structures like Grayscale, these have already existed in the U.S. 
market for some time.
 
To put the early days of the launch into perspective, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) 
became the fastest ETF to reach $10 billion in AUM, achieving this milestone in just 51 days. In 
contrast, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) took 818 days to reach the same benchmark. It should 
be noted that the global money supply (M2) was significantly lower when GLD was launched. 
Nevertheless, the launch certainly exceeded expectations and demonstrates the popularity, 
efficiency, and investor preference of ETFs. 

9
Before the launch of U.S. spot ETFs, though, the EMEA region dominated the crypto ETP market, 
accounting for 70–100% of AUM in the pre-COVID era and 50–60% between 2021 and 2023. APAC 
and South America-based products maintained a relatively minor share of global AUM throughout 
the nine years since the first crypto ETP’s introduction in 2015.
However, the landscape changed dramatically with the launch of U.S. spot ETFs. The regional 
share of global AUM shifted drastically, with EMEA’s portion plummeting to 12.8% and continuing a 
steady decline. To illustrate this shift:
	

The global crypto ETP AUM in December 2023 was around $15.2 billion
	

By the end of January 2024, after just three weeks of U.S. spot ETF trading, global AUM 
jumped 178% month-over-month to $42.3 billion
	

By the end of Q1 2024, global AUM had skyrocketed to $82.9 billion, a staggering 445% 
increase from the start of 2024
Volume
Global volume as of October 2024 reached $57.2 billion, posting a remarkable 790% increase year-
over-year. This volume growth mirrors, and perhaps even surpasses, the dramatic narrative of AUM 
growth and market share shifts.

10
The crypto ETP market’s evolution is striking when viewed across distinct eras. In the pre-2021 
period, monthly ETP volumes averaged a relatively modest $472 million. In comparison, spot crypto 
markets were already turning over $645 billion in December 2020. ETP volume eventually surged 
to an average of $6.8 billion between 2021 and 2023. Year-to-date, however, monthly crypto ETP 
volumes have skyrocketed to an average of $72 billion, which is more than tenfold the monthly 
average throughout the entire 2021-2023 boom-bust cycle.
 
The regional distribution of volumes has undergone a seismic shift. Initially, EMEA dominated, but 
its lead had already dwindled to 30-40% at the 2021 bull market’s peak.
The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs triggered a dramatic realignment. Now, the U.S. commands 
an overwhelming 95.2% of global volume. EMEA’s share has plummeted to 4.1%, while APAC and 
South America trail with 1.0% and 0.3% respectively.
 
Underlying
Next, let’s examine how ETPs with various underlying assets fared across AUM and volume. Here, 
we will focus on products across five categories: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Baskets, 
and Single Names (excluding BTC, ETH, and SOL).
In terms of AUM, BTC clearly dominates, representing over $82 billion in total assets, or 84.4% of 
global AUM. ETH follows with 10.5%, accounting for just over $10 billion. SOL makes up 1.2% with $1.1 
billion, while Baskets comprise 3.1% at $2.9 billion. Single-name products (excluding BTC, ETH, and 
SOL) account for the remaining 1.8%, or $1.7B of AUM.

11
 
Examining the historical share of AUM across different underlying assets over the past 7 years 
reveals greater diversity, despite Bitcoin typically maintaining the majority of AUM.
We also note a strong negative correlation (r=-0.61) between Bitcoin’s share of AUM and the ETH/
BTC ratio. Interestingly, since 2021, there have been two key divergences between BTC’s AUM 
dominance and ETH/BTC, where BTC’s AUM dominance suggested further strength or weakness 
for the ETH/BTC ratio. The first divergence occurred in May 2021, and the second in January 2024.
 
While several explanations are possible, one plausible explanation is that as crypto becomes more 
integrated into the traditional financial system and price discovery incorporates more institutional 
players, traditional markets are increasingly driving markets for the largest crypto assets.
Examining the share of global volume reveals an even more striking narrative. ETP market 
volumes signaled a sharp shift towards BTC dominance in September 2021, with the ETH/BTC ratio 
subsequently adjusting to reflect this clear shift.

12
 
Given the emergence and popularity of SOL in the current market cycle, it’s worth diving a bit 
deeper to see how AUM and volumes evolved.
One interesting observation is that during the 2021 cycle peak, SOL ETP AUM reached its high of 
$239 million, representing 11% of Single Name ETPs (excluding BTC, ETH, and SOL). At that time, 
SOL was trading above $250. Fast forward to today, with SOL trading at around $250 again and 
SOL AUM has surged to $1.16B, a 485% increase, and now commands over 40% of Single Name 
AUM (excluding BTC, ETH, and SOL). This growth is particularly noteworthy given the absence of a 
spot SOL ETF approved for trading in the U.S.
 
 

13
 
In terms of SOL’s share of Single Name volume, we observe that SOL already accounts for 44% of 
Single Name volume, even reaching as high as 60% in October 2023. This trend mirrors what we 
saw with BTC’s ETP volume dominance preceding a correction in the ETH/BTC ratio. Similarly, here 
we notice that the spike in Solana volume dominance preceded both the Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 rise 
in SOL price.
As we delve deeper into the landscape of crypto ETPs, it’s crucial to examine how the AUM of BTC, 
ETH, and SOL ETPs compared to their respective market capitalizations. This can provide some 
insight into the relative penetration of these cryptocurrencies in the ETP market and helps gauge 
institutional interest and adoption.
By comparing the AUM to market cap ratios, we can better understand the extent to which these 
digital assets are being accessed through regulated investment vehicles versus direct holdings or 
other means of exposure.

14
 
As shown in the graph, January 2024 marked a crucial inflection point for BTC, while July 2024 was 
significant for ETH, coinciding with the approval of their respective spot ETFs for U.S. trading. BTC’s 
AUM/MC currently stands at 3.7% after spending most of this year remaining in a range between 
2.5-3.5%.
Interestingly, before the SEC’s approval, ETH ETP dominance consistently surpassed both 
BTC’s and SOL’s. Currently, ETH ETPs holds 3.1% of the total ETH market cap, a figure that could 
potentially re-rate higher if historical ratios mean-revert and ETH is able to catch one or more 
narrative tailwinds.
SOL ETP dominance currently sits at a modest 1.4% relative to its market capitalization. However, 
this is expected to change dramatically once SOL spot ETFs are approved for U.S. trading. Until 
then, Europe may serve as a model for potential developments. According to data on European 
crypto ETFs from 21Shares, as of October 2024, physical Solana ETP AUM has already surpassed 
physical Ethereum ETP AUM, reaching $1.4 billion compared to Ethereum’s slightly over $1.0 billion. 
Assuming current prices and SOL AUM/MC converges to that of BTC and ETH’s, then we could 
expect SOL dominance to tack on another 2-2.5% of market cap, or an additional $2.4-3.0 billion in 
net new assets.
One lingering question is how much of crypto’s market cap will be absorbed by ETPs. While we 
don’t have a definitive answer, comparing it to gold suggests we are already in uncharted territory.
The U.S. Geological Survey reports that 244,000 metric tons of gold have been discovered to 
date. This includes 187,000 metric tons historically produced and 57,000 metric tons in current 
underground reserves.
As of November 2024, gold ETF AUM totaled $130 billion. With a gold price of $58.4 million per ton, 
the total value of all existing gold is approximately $10.9 trillion. Consequently, gold ETFs represent 
only 1.2% of the value of all above-ground gold. From this perspective, Bitcoin ETPs’ share of their 
total underlying mined market cap is already triple that of gold and likely headed higher.

15
4. Regulatory Landscape
 
Throughout 2024, the global regulatory landscape for crypto ETPs showed a two-speed 
development. While some jurisdictions embraced crypto ETPs and related innovations, others 
maintained a more cautious approach. Overall, the positive reception outweighed the hesitancy, 
enabling the seismic market changes discussed earlier. These developments have significantly 
enhanced the accessibility and inclusion of crypto investments, particularly in major financial 
markets.
4.1.1. United States
The U.S. crypto market witnessed a watershed moment on January 10, 2024, when the SEC 
approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs. This landmark decision, following years of rejections, signalled 
a pivotal shift in crypto adoption within traditional finance. The SEC simultaneously approved 
11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, including offerings from established issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and 
Grayscale. This move enabled direct investment in Bitcoin through regulated, exchange-traded 
vehicles, addressing long-standing concerns about market manipulation and custody. Despite 
the approval, SEC Chair Gary Gensler maintained a cautious stance, emphasizing that the SEC’s 
decision did not constitute an endorsement of Bitcoin itself.
The impact of this regulatory shift was immediate and profound. The launch day saw 
unprecedented trading volumes, with nearly $4.6 billion traded across all products. Moreover, 
this approval set the stage for further innovations in the crypto ETP space, culminating in the 
subsequent approval of Ethereum ETFs in the summer of 2024. This series of developments 
marked a new era in the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial markets.
Given a second Trump presidency and Republican-controlled Congress, we may be on the verge of 
a paradigm shift in the U.S. regulatory environment the likes of which we have never seen before. 
Trump has expressed a desire to make America “the crypto capital of the planet” suggesting a 
more favourable regulatory environment for digital assets. This stance, combined with current SEC 
Chair Gary Gensler’s decision to step-down from the Commission effective on January 20, 2025, 
indicates a potential pivot away from the current “regulation by enforcement” approach.
Furthermore, a Republican Congress is seen as more likely to pass a comprehensive regulatory 
framework for cryptocurrencies, which the industry has been advocating for and was supported 
by Vice President-elect JD Vance. This could potentially include clearer guidelines for crypto 

16
businesses, reduced regulatory uncertainty, and possibly clearer stances on securities classification. 
However, it’s important to note that while this scenario suggests a more crypto-friendly regulatory 
landscape, the specifics of any new policies or legislation would still need to be developed and 
implemented, and the full impact on the crypto industry would likely unfold over time.
4.1.2. Europe
The European Union made significant strides in crypto regulation with the Markets in Crypto-
Assets regulation (MiCAR), formally approved in April 2023 and fully-applicable by the end of 2024, 
notwithstanding potential delays in enforcement by regulators. MiCAR provides a comprehensive 
framework for crypto-assets, including provisions for market participants that are part of the 
crypto product value-chain like custodians, and tasked the European Securities and Markets 
Authority with developing technical standards and guidelines for implementation.
This regulation is meant to introduce a unified approach across the EU, replacing the previous 
patchwork of national regulations. We expect the impact on ETPs to be positive with increased 
regulatory clarity encouraging more traditional financial institutions, banks, and investment firms 
to enter the crypto ETP market, facilitating cross-border offerings within the EU, and enhancing 
investor protection measures and boosting overall confidence in crypto ETPs.
In a related development, ESMA issued a call for evidence in May 2024 on the review of the 
UCITS eligible assets directive. This initiative specifically addressed the potential harmonization 
of crypto asset exposure within the UCITS framework, aiming to assess whether and how crypto 
assets could be integrated into the UCITS structure, often regarded as the gold standard for retail 
investment funds in Europe. This review could potentially pave the way for more mainstream 
adoption of crypto assets in regulated investment products, making crypto products available to 
the $13 trillion UCITS AUM. The consultation solicited responses from leading crypto issuers and 
institutions such as 21Shares, BlackRock, Coinbase, and CoinShares.
4.1.3. United Kingdom
The UK took a cautious stance on crypto ETPs in 2024. While maintaining its ban on crypto 
derivatives for retail investors, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) allowed crypto ETNs for 
professional investors only. This balanced approach aimed to foster innovation while protecting 
retail investors.
The FCA’s decision enabled increased institutional participation in the UK crypto ETP market and 
positioned London competitively among European financial centers. This move reflected the UK’s 
efforts to stay relevant in the digital asset landscape while prioritizing investor protection through 
sufficient controls and proper disclosures.
4.1.4. Hong Kong & China
In April 2024, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) approved spot Bitcoin and 
Ether ETFs, marking a first in Asia. Three Chinese issuers launched six ETFs on April 30, 2024, 
allowing retail investors exposure to Bitcoin and Ether prices without direct ownership. These ETFs 
feature an ‘in-kind’ subscription mechanism for direct crypto transactions.
This move aligns with Hong Kong’s strategy to become a global virtual asset hub. By November 
2024, Hong Kong’s virtual asset spot ETFs reached HKD $3.3 billion ($430 million) in AUM. However, 
mainland Chinese investors can’t access these ETFs due to China’s crypto restrictions. Despite 
this limitation, the ETFs strengthen Hong Kong’s position in the global crypto market and offer 
regulated access to digital assets.
4.1.5. United Arab Emirates
Dubai and the broader United Arab Emirates (UAE) have emerged as significant players in the 
crypto ETP landscape, with their proactive approach to digital asset regulation and ambition to 
become a global crypto hub. In 2022, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) took a major 

17
step by approving the listing and trading of a 21Shares’ spot Bitcoin ETP on Nasdaq Dubai, marking 
a first for the region.
This move followed the establishment of the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in Dubai, 
which has been critical in creating a comprehensive framework for crypto assets. The UAE’s 
crypto-friendly stance has attracted major players in the industry, with exchanges like Binance and 
Kraken obtaining licenses to operate in the country.
Additionally, in August 2024, the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) introduced a regulatory 
framework for blockchain-based ETFs, paving the way for the launch of spot crypto ETFs in the 
UAE capital. This framework allows for the creation, listing, and trading of ETFs based on single 
cryptocurrencies and baskets of digital assets.
These developments have positioned the UAE as a key player in the global crypto ETP market, 
offering a regulated environment for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to 
digital assets. The country’s approach is likely to influence regulatory trends in the broader Middle 
East region and potentially attract more international crypto businesses and investors.
4.1.6. Japan
Japan has made significant strides towards integrating crypto ETPs into its financial ecosystem. 
In July 2024, SBI Holdings and Franklin Templeton announced a partnership to establish a 
digital asset management company, positioning themselves to launch Bitcoin ETFs in Japan. 
Nevertheless, it remains unclear when the Financial Services Agency (FSA) will approve crypto 
ETFs and create further alignment in the country’s regulatory framework for cryptocurrency 
products.
This move is part of Japan’s broader strategy to attract high-net-worth clients and diversify 
its alternative asset investment products. Overall, these developments demonstrate Japan’s 
commitment to embracing digital assets within its financial markets, potentially setting a 
precedent for other Asian countries to follow.
4.1.7. Transformative Year
Overall, 2024 has been a transformative year for crypto ETPs globally, with significant regulatory 
developments across major financial markets. The U.S. led the charge with the approval of spot 
Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, marking a pivotal shift in crypto adoption within traditional finance. 
Europe’s MiCAR provided a comprehensive framework, enhancing regulatory clarity and investor 
protection. The UK maintained a cautious approach, allowing crypto ETNs for professional 
investors while protecting retail investors. Hong Kong emerged as a pioneer in Asia by approving 
spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, strengthening its position as a virtual asset hub. Japan’s progress 
towards integrating crypto ETPs signals a growing acceptance of digital assets in established 
financial markets.
These regulatory advancements collectively represent a global trend towards greater acceptance 
and accessibility of crypto investments, setting the stage for continued growth and innovation in 
the crypto ETP landscape.

5. Technological Developments
 
The emergence of crypto ETPs has brought about innovative approaches to transparency and 
trust-building, leveraging the unique properties of blockchain technology. One of the most 
significant innovations in this space is the integration of on-chain data and Proof of Reserves (PoR) 
systems, which provide unprecedented levels of transparency and verification for investors.
Proof of Reserves has become a critical feature for many crypto ETP issuers, allowing them to 
demonstrate in real-time that they hold sufficient assets to back their products. This system 
typically employs blockchain technology to publicly verify a crypto company’s on-chain assets, 
using secure data structures like Merkle trees to aggregate total customer balances without 
exposing private information. For instance, in February 2024, 21Shares announced the integration 
of Chainlink Proof of Reserve for their Core Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and in July for their Core Ethereum 
ETF (CETH), enabling clear visibility into the underlying BTC and ETH reserves. This move not only 
enhances transparency but also provides investors with increased assurances that the ETP is fully 
backed by the underlying cryptocurrency.

The use of on-chain data extends beyond simple asset verification. It enables automated near 
real-time on-chain tracking and programmatic utility. Investors can build automated logic 
based on updates to an ETP’s underlying collateralization, as reflected by on-chain holdings. A 
clear example of this is how market participants can freely access on-chain data platforms like 
Arkham Intelligence to track an issuer’s stock and flow of the underlying collateral for the ETF. 
In the screenshot above, we can see the daily inflows of BTC from a single Coinbase address to 
BlackRock’s network of addresses.
This level of transparency was previously impossible with traditional financial products. Moreover, 
the decentralized nature of these systems eliminates central points of failure in delivering this 
on-chain data, always ensuring reliable updates regarding an ETP’s collateralization. As the crypto 
ETP market continues to mature, these innovations in transparency and verification are likely to 
become industry standards, potentially influencing broader financial markets beyond the crypto 
space.
Finally, while not a technological development in and of itself, Grayscale’s launch of spin-off ETFs 
for its BTC and ETH trusts in 2024 marked an unprecedented move in the ETP space. The creation 
of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust as lower-cost alternatives to 
their flagship products, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), 
represented a novel approach to product diversification in the crypto ETP space.

This strategy allowed Grayscale to offer investors a choice between products “on different parts 
of the spectrum,” as noted by Grayscale managing director John Hoffman. The spin-offs were 
structured using a 90-10% sharing formula, where existing shareholders of GBTC and ETHE 
received proportional shares in the new, lower-fee ETFs.
This approach was unique in that it allowed Grayscale to maintain its established, higher-fee 
products while simultaneously introducing more competitive offerings to attract a broader range 
of investors. The spin-offs also demonstrated an innovative way to seed new ETFs, as the initial 
assets for BTC and ETH came from distributing 10% of the underlying assets from GBTC and 
ETHE, respectively. This move not only set a new precedent for product evolution in the crypto 
ETP market but also highlighted the growing sophistication and maturity of the sector, as asset 
managers began to employ strategies more commonly seen in traditional finance to cater to 
diverse investor needs.

6. Future Outlook
 
As we look towards the future of the crypto ETP landscape, several key trends and factors are 
poised to shape its evolution. The rapid growth and increasing sophistication of this market 
segment have set the stage for further developments across multiple fronts.
From product innovation and regulatory shifts to technological advancements and changing 
market dynamics, the crypto ETP sector is entering a new phase of maturity and integration with 
traditional finance. In this section, we’ll explore the various aspects that are likely to define the 
future of crypto ETPs, touching on the opportunities and challenges that possibly lie ahead for 
investors, issuers, and regulators alike.
	
 Product Innovation and Expansion
The crypto ETP market is rapidly evolving, with 
issuers constantly introducing new products 
to meet diverse investor needs. For instance, 
in October 2024, 21Shares launched the Future 
of Crypto Index ETP (FUTR) on Euronext Paris 
and Amsterdam, offering exposure to 6 key 
crypto megathemes. This trend of thematic and 
sector-specific crypto ETPs is likely to continue, 
providing investors with more targeted 
exposure to different segments of the crypto 
ecosystem.
Additionally, as regulators become more 
comfortable with crypto assets and adoption 
increases, particularly in the U.S., we may 
see the approval of ETPs based on emerging 
cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, 
such as Solana and Wormhole, or even 
memecoins like Doge, Pepe, or Popcat, further 
expanding the investment landscape.
	
 Regulatory Developments
The regulatory landscape for crypto ETPs 
continues to evolve globally, with significant 
implications for market growth and investor 
protection. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs 
in the U.S. in January 2024 was a watershed 
moment, followed by Ethereum ETF approvals 
later in the year.
Looking ahead, the re-election of Donald 
Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential race, the 
Republican congressional landslide victory, and 
the rise of the crypto lobby portend a more 
crypto-friendly and constructive regulatory and 
business environment. The implementation 
of MiCAR in the EU is also set to provide a 
comprehensive framework for crypto assets, 
potentially influencing global standards.
	
 Institutional Adoption and Market 
Integration
Q2 2024 13F filings revealed that advisors 
increased their market share of institutional 
AUM in Bitcoin ETFs from 27% in Q1 to 36% 
in Q2. Major banks like Morgan Stanley and 
Goldman Sachs have also expanded their 
Bitcoin ETF holdings on behalf of clients, each 
disclosing positions exceeding $100 million.
Furthermore, the entry of state pension funds, 
such as the State of Michigan Retirement 
System, into crypto ETPs signals growing 
mainstream acceptance. As more institutional 
investors allocate to crypto ETPs, we can expect 
increased liquidity, potentially lower volatility, 
and greater integration of crypto assets into 
traditional portfolio management strategies.
	
 Technological Advancements
Technological innovations are enhancing the 
transparency, security, and functionality of 
crypto ETPs. For instance, in July 2024, 21Shares 
announced the integration of Chainlink Proof 
of Reserve for their Core Ethereum ETF (CETH), 
enabling real-time verification of the underlying 
ETH reserves. This trend towards on-chain 
verification is likely to continue, potentially 
becoming an industry standard. Additionally, 
advancements in custody solutions, such as 
multi-party computation (MPC) technology, 
are improving the security of crypto assets 
held by ETP issuers. Looking forward, we may 
see the integration of Decentralized Finance 
(DeFi) principles into ETP structures, such 
as yield-generating ETPs that participate in 
staking or lending protocols, offering new value 
propositions to investors.
	
 Market Structure and Dynamics
The crypto ETP market is experiencing rapid 
changes in its competitive landscape and 
operational dynamics. The launch of spot 
Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has shifted the global 
balance of AUM and trading volumes, with the 
U.S. commanding 96.7% of global volume by 
October 2024. 
Furthermore, the conversion of Grayscale’s 
trusts to ETFs and the launch of their “mini” 
versions demonstrate the evolving product 

21
strategies in response to market demand. As 
the market matures, we may see evolving fee 
structures and potentially the emergence of 
actively managed crypto ETPs, reshaping the 
competitive landscape.
	
 Macroeconomic Factors
As cryptocurrencies have emerged from the 
developer forums and began integrating into 
the global financial system, macroeconomic 
factors have had a significant impact on the 
underlying assets and will continue to influence 
the crypto ETP market.
For instance, the anticipation of a more 
accommodative interest rate environment in 
2025 could drive increased risk appetite and 
potentially boost demand for crypto ETPs. The 
impact of geopolitical events, such as regulatory 
crackdowns in certain countries or the adoption 
of crypto-friendly policies in others, can also 
significantly affect global crypto ETP flows.
Moreover, the potential launch of Central Bank 
Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in major economies 
could have far-reaching implications for the 
crypto ecosystem and, by extension, crypto 
ETPs. As these global factors evolve, they will 
continue to shape investor sentiment and 
capital flows in the crypto ETP market.
	
 Investor Education and Accessibility
As crypto ETPs become more mainstream, 
there’s an increasing focus on investor 
education and improving accessibility. For 
example, major asset managers like BlackRock 
and Fidelity have launched extensive 
educational initiatives alongside their crypto 
ETP offerings, helping investors understand the 
unique characteristics and risks of crypto assets.
Looking ahead, we may see the development 
of more user-friendly interfaces for crypto ETP 
trading, integration with robo-advisors, and 
simplified product structures aimed at mass-
market adoption. The challenge of bridging the 
knowledge gap between traditional finance 
and the crypto world will remain crucial for the 
continued growth and adoption of crypto ETPs.
	
 Geopolitical Influences
Geopolitical factors are playing an increasingly 
important role in shaping the global crypto 
ETP landscape. For instance, Hong Kong’s 
approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs 
in April 2024 positioned it as a leader in Asia’s 
crypto financial market, potentially influencing 
other countries in the region. The ongoing 
regulatory divergence between different 
jurisdictions, such as the more crypto-friendly 
approach in countries like Switzerland, Dubai, 
and UAE, compared to stricter regulations in 
China, creates a complex global landscape for 
crypto ETP issuers and investors. As the world’s 
largest financial market, the U.S. holds outsized 
influence, and the stance taken by the Trump 
administration will have ripple effects on other 
jurisdictions. This is especially true given the 
substantial investments crypto lobbies have 
made in his re-election campaign, highlighting 
the pivotal role of U.S. policy in defining the 
global crypto landscape.
Future geopolitical shifts, such as changes 
in government attitudes towards crypto in 
major economies or the use of crypto assets 
to circumvent international sanctions, could 
significantly impact the global distribution and 
adoption of crypto ETPs.
	
 Market Maturity and Liquidity
As the crypto ETP market matures, we’re seeing 
significant improvements in liquidity and price 
discovery mechanisms. By October 2024, global 
crypto ETP trading volumes reached $57.2 
billion, a 790% increase year-over-year. This 
increased liquidity is narrowing spreads and 
reducing trading costs for investors.
Adding to this market maturation, the launch 
of options on crypto spot ETFs in the U.S. 
represents another significant milestone. This 
development will introduce new hedging and 
trading strategies for institutional investors, 
potentially increasing market depth and 
sophistication. The introduction of options could 
also enhance price discovery mechanisms and 
provide additional tools for risk management 
in the crypto ETP ecosystem. As these options 
become available, we can expect further 
improvements in liquidity, more sophisticated 
market-making activities, and potentially the 
development of a robust derivatives market 
based on crypto ETPs. This evolution signifies 
the growing integration of crypto assets 
into traditional financial structures and the 
increasing maturity of the crypto ETP market.
Finally, with the new Trump administration and 
generally pro-crypto stance in Congress, we 
might see more traditional banks entering the 
space in an environment where the SEC’s Staff 
Accounting Bulletin 121, which had previously 
discouraged banks from offering crypto custody 
services, may be revisited or repealed. This 
potential shift could lead to a more integrated 
and accessible crypto financial ecosystem, 
further expanding access of crypto ETPs to a 
broader investor base.

7. Conclusion
 
The 2024 crypto ETP landscape has witnessed unprecedented evolution, marked by significant 
regulatory breakthroughs, technological advancements, and institutional adoption. The approval 
of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. represented a pivotal moment, catalyzing a surge 
in global AUM and trading volumes. This milestone, coupled with innovative product launches 
and improved market infrastructure, has fundamentally transformed the accessibility and 
sophistication of crypto products.
The market’s maturation is evident in several key developments: the integration of advanced 
transparency tools like on-chain verification systems, the emergence of diverse product offerings 
including thematic ETPs, and the growing participation of traditional financial institutions. 
Looking ahead, the crypto ETP sector appears primed for further growth. The convergence of 
regulatory tailwinds and increasing institutional acceptance portends a future where crypto 
ETPs become an increasingly mainstream component of investment portfolios. However, this 
growth will likely be accompanied by new challenges, including the need for enhanced market 
infrastructure and improved investor education.
As the market continues to evolve, the success of crypto ETPs will depend on the industry’s ability 
to maintain high standards of transparency, security, and compliance while innovating to meet 
evolving investor demands. In 2024, we saw the foundation being laid and the stage has been set 
for a more mature, accessible, and sophisticated crypto ETP ecosystem in the years ahead.
