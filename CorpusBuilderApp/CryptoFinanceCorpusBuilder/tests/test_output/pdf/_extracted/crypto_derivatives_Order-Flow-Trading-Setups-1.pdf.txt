 
Risk Disclosure  
Futures and Forex trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor 
could potentially lose all or more than their  initial investment. Risk capital is money that can 
be lost without jeopardizing one’s  financial security or lifestyle . Only risk  capital should be 
used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past 
performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.  
Hypothetical Performance Disclosure  
Hypothetical performance results have many inhere nt limitations, some of which are 
described below. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve 
profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there are frequently sharp differences 
between hypothetical performance resu lts and the actual results subsequently achieved by 
any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is 
that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical 
trading does not inv olve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely 
account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand 
losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses is a material point  
that can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related 
to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program that 
cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothet ical performance results and all 
of which can adversely affect trading results. This book is for educational purposes only and 
the opinions expressed are those of the author only. All trades presented should be 
considered hypothetical. None of  the trades a re traded in a live account.

 My Story  
Hello, my name is Dale, and I’ve been a full -time trader since 2008. I have always been very 
passionate about economics, finance, and trading. I got my university degree in finance  before 
becoming a certified portfolio manager  and an  investment manager, as well as  getting my 
financial derivati ves certification. Unlike most of the  other  trading "gurus," I am proud to say 
that I have a proper education and trading certification s. Of course, this is  thanks to my 
parents , who supported me enormously in my studies and at the start of my career.  
Fresh out of college, I started to work as a market analyst for a major brokerage. Most would 
be grateful to have this position right out of college , but I didn’t really  feel that way . I had two 
problems with this job. The first one was that I didn’t  like having a boss who told me what to 
do. I always studied hard to be independent , not an employee. The second reason was that I 
didn’t particularly appreciat e how the company treated its customers. I think this is an issue 
with most Forex brokers. They d on’t really  care if their clients make money or not. They are 
selfish  and focus primarily on their fees. They feel no responsibility, and they don’t care about 
their clients ’ best interest s. I didn’t like being a tool in such a company, so I left.  
After I quit my job, I focused all my efforts on trading . I started by  testing numerous  trading 
strategies, trying different trading approaches, backtesting various patterns , and anything 
else you can think of  for 12 –15 hours every day.  
I was trading vari ous instruments and using many different trading styles. I was trading stocks, 
investment certificates, and automated trading systems. Currently, my primary focus is on 
manual currency  trading.  
When I started trading currencies , I was under the impression that I needed to find a Holy 
Grail , which would make me a big pile of money quickly. I was searching for this Holy Grail 
among various trading indicators. I tried most of the standard indicators with many different 
settings, but nothing worked , at least no t in the long run.  
My first tangible success was when I finally got rid of all the indicators and started anew with 
simple Price Action. For the first time,  I felt I was getting somewhere! The big "eureka 
moment" came when I combined Price Action with Volu me Profile.  
9 
 At first, I was trading only swing trades. I was working mostly on a daily time frame and , as 
you can imagine , I did not have many trades. Still, this was the first time I felt confident about 
my trading. I was also thrilled  that I had finally found my way and that my trading had become 
consistent.  
For many people this would be enough , but I wanted  to learn more and go further . I started 
to go much deeper , and I began  to look fo r a method or a tool suitable for day trading  on 
much faster time frames.  
  
10 
 Why I Started Using  Order Flow  
At first, I was using Price Action and Volume Profile, but I wanted more , so I went into  tape 
reading using DOM (Depth of Market) . DOM is a feature t hat shows all the orders that appear  
in the market —including  the “pending orders .”  
DOM (Depth of Market):  
 
This seemed like the right way to go until I realized that m ost pending orders never get filled . 
These  orders are only placed in the market to move  the price in the desired direction . When 
the price comes close to them, they are , in most cases , withdrawn. Sort of l ike a carrot in front 
of a donkey , he remains in constant pursuit but never actually gets it.  
For me, DOM was just full of noise and too hard to read . I knew t here was a lot of useful info 
there , but I need ed something  to help me read that crazy matrix. This is where the Order Flow  
came  into play.  
The big advantage of using the Order Flow is that it  prints orders that matter —orders that 
actually got filled (not the pending orders , which are often never filled ). Order Flow  also prints 

11 
 those orders in a way that is much  easier to read as well as  backtest . Exactly the thing I 
needed!  
At first , I started to use a third -party Order Flow software . After  some time , I came up with a 
few ideas for how the Order Flow could be improved by adding some specific and helpful 
features . Long story short —I had a custom -made Order Flow developed  with the addition al 
features built i n! 
Now I use my Order Flow  every day for my intraday trading. I prefer to use it with Price Action 
and Volume Profile  as those  show  me the bigger picture . Still, there are others who prefer to 
use Order Flow as a standalone  indicator you build your trading around.  
What Will You Learn ? 
This book aim s to give you precise,  immediately actionable info without wasting your time on 
unnecessary filler and fluff . It’s the type of  book I would love to have  had when I started to 
learn how to trade with the Order Flow. Here is what you can look forward to learn ing: 
• Choosing the right trading platform for Order Flow trading  
• NinjaTrader 8 platform – introduction  
• Choosing the right Order Flow softwar e 
• Where to get data for Order Flow  
• The best instruments to trade with Order Flow  
• Order Flow – what it tells us  
• Order Flow – special features  
• How to set up  Order Flow workspace  
• Order Flow – trading setups  
• Order Flow – confirmation setups  
• How to use Order Flow to determine your Take Profit and Stop Loss  
• How to use Order Flow for trade management  
• How to find strong institutional Supports and Resistances using Volume Profile  
• How to combine Order Flow with Volume Profile  
All that in a straightforward  way with many pictures and examples.  
12 
 Important Notice  
Before we jump straight into it, I need to tell you that this is not a magic “get rich quick” guide. 
The Order Flow is a fantastic tool , and the strategies I am going to show you are the best -
proven strategies I know. BUT this alone won’t make you a great trader. Just like  getting a 
new Ferrari does not make you a better  driver. You need to practice and you need hands -on 
experience. You mu st spend time and energy learning to trade with the Order Flow yourself! 
Hands -on experience cannot be learned from a book!  
So, if you don ’t mind that I won ’t be giving you a “magic pill” (as it doesn’t exist) , let‘s move 
on to the first chapter!  
  
13 
 Setting  up Order Flow  
NinjaTrader 8 Trading Platform  
The trading platform I use for running Order Flow is NinjaTrader 8 . I have been using 
NinjaTrader 8 for many years , and I highly recommend it . 
A significan t advantage of NinjaTrader 8 is that it is a free platf orm. Yes, really. It has a free 
mode , which is without any restrictions and has all its functions  enabled . I have never had a 
reason to switch to their paid version, which shows how cool the free version is.  
Also, all the indicators I have developed for N injaTrader 8 platform (Volume Profile, VWAP , 
and Order Flow) work with the free version.  
The way I do it is that I do my analysis on the  NinjaTrader 8  platform , but when it comes to 
trade execution , I do it on another platform with my broker.  
There is a shortlist of brokers that you can connect to NinjaTrader 8 and trade straight from 
this platform, but , in my opinion , there are better and cheaper brokers around than those 
who are supported by Ninja Trader 8. For this reason , I use the NT8 only for charting , and I 
execute the trades elsewhere. This may seem like a disadvantage, but I believe that being able 
to choose your own broker  is worth it.  
Here are some useful links for you:  
NinjaTrader 8 platfo rm download:  https://ninjatrader.com  
My preferred broker:  https://www.trader -dale.com/forex -brokers  
 
Other Trading Platforms  
A persist ent question I get is whether Order Flow can run on the Meta trader  4 platform.  While  
it may be possible , there are  too many limitations and problems . MT4 is a 15+ -year -old 
software , and trying to run Order Flow there would be like placing an engine from a Ferrari 
into an old, half -broken budget car thinking you would  start winning races with it.  
14 
 A lot of people also like using TradingView  for their charting. It is a fine platform , but , 
unfortunately,  you can’t run Order Flow there.  
There are also some other  charting platforms ; one of the most famous (apart from 
NinjaTrader ) is Sierra . This platform is not free , though ; you need to pay monthly fees to use 
it. 
 
Data Feed for Order Flow  
Order Flow shows all executed Buy and Sell orders traded in the exchange.  To see those 
orders , you need a n excellent  data  feed that gives you Bid and Ask data. Such data is often 
referred to as  “Level 1 ” data .  
There is also “Level 2”  data,  but you won’t need that. Level 2 data includes market depth, 
which the Order Fl ow does not use (that is only useful , for example , when  tape reading).  
Since Order Flow is best used with centralized markets, I suggest you use it with Futures data. 
My recommended data provider is CQG.   
 
CQG – Futures Data Feed  
You can get a free trial data  feed connection here: https://ninjatrader.com/FreeLiveData  
This trial CQG connection will expire after some time , and then you will have two options. The 
first option will be  to create a new t rial using a different email address. The second option will 
be to start paying monthly fees for the data  feed.   
I don’t think there is a better way to get free Futures data anywhere without  limitations.  
If you need a connection for any specific trading in strument, then the best way is to email 
NinjaTrader support directly and tell them what you need. They will help  with any questions  
and give you a quote  for that particular data  feed connection.  
They usually respond quickly , and they are very helpful  overa ll. You can contact them via email 
here:  platformsupport@ninjatrader.com  
15 
 Where to Get Order Flow  
If you search the internet , you will discover  many Order Flow software options  availabl e. The 
price ranges from around $100 to $5 ,000, with  some cost ing even more ! 
Let’s first talk about the cheap ones. As with many things in this world , here also applies : “You 
buy cheap, you get cheap .” If you manage to purchase Order Flow for $100 somewhere  on 
the inte rnet , don’t expect the functionality to be any good. You also can’t expect any help or 
service  from the software provider  either . 
The other extreme is Order Flow software for thousands of dollars. In my experience, those 
are full of many tweaks and feature s a real trader does not really need. They are there  only 
to justify the high price. Also, in m y experience , such software is often developed by coders 
who are not real traders. They don’t know what an Order Flow trader really needs. Those guys 
usually  code any feature they can think of (useful or not) , and they add it to the ir software.  
This way , their Order Flow  looks full of cool features to justify the higher price.  
The ideal solution is to get  your  Order Flow  software  from a real trader who developed it by 
working hand in hand with the software developer .  
When I was working on  my Order Flow software, I made sure of two things: First, the core of 
the Order Flow was 100% working, was well optimized , and work ed with various trading 
instruments.  Second, the unique  features  my Order Flow had were all useful and helpful in 
real trading. My software has  no redundant features or added black -box indicators , of which  
nobody really knows what they do or how they are calculated.  I am really proud of the special  
features we built into the software,  and I cannot wait to show you later in this book!  
If you decide to get my custom -made Order Flow software  (along with further Order Flow 
training) , you can get it  here:

16 
 What Instruments Can You Trade  with Order Flow?  
Order Flow is best used for day trading. The most popular markets are:  
• Currency Futures  / Forex  
• Indice s Futures  (S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Jones, DAX… ) 
• Oil, Metals (Gold…)  
• Stocks  
I use Order Flow  mostly for currency Futures. As I mentioned before,  I do my analysis on 
NinjaTrader 8 using  currency Futures . I then  execute the trades with my Forex broker in the 
spot Forex market .  
 
Which Trading Instrument Should You Start With ? 
I recommend starting with just one trading instrument, for example 6E (EUR  Futures ), and 
focus ing solely  on that. The reason is that every trading instrument behaves differently . Every 
instrument  or market has a different average volume traded , different times when it is most 
active , different reactions, etc . It takes a lot of t ime just to master one instrument!  
Professional day traders often focus only on one trading instrument  they have mastered and 
which they trade. When starting, I don’t see an advantage to choosing many markets as it will 
just complicate the learning proces s. 
I focus primarily  on the 6E (EUR Futures ). This is where I feel most comfortable and where I 
have by far my best trading results.  
 
Order Flow : Forex  vs. Futures  
“Why do we need to use Futures instead of  Forex? ” That’s a good question I get quite often. 
The distinction between th ese two is this:  
17 
 Futures:  Is centralized, which means that everybody on the planet sees the same price and 
volumes  traded . Most importantly, Futures allow us to see  how much volume was  traded on  
the Bid as well as the  Ask. 
 
 
 
Forex:  Is decentralized, which means that only people who use the same data  feed provider 
see the same price and volumes. Data from each data provider can differ a bi t. Not too much, 
but the difference is there . The main disadvantage to Futures is that Forex providers are 
unable to distin guish Bid and Ask (or if they do , they do it very badly). So , the best you can 
get is Total volume ( = sum of Bid + Ask).  
 

18 
 Transferring Trading Levels  from Currency Futures to Forex  
Because I do my analysis on currency Futures but then execute my trades in the Forex market , 
I need to transfer my Support/Resistance levels from Futures to Forex.  
Transferring levels from EUR and AUD Futures to EUR/USD  and AUD/USD  (Forex) is pretty 
simple. You place the two charts next to each other, visually compare, and then  transfer the 
level from left to right . It is pretty simple to find the level because the correlation is virtually  
100 % ( the charts look the same).   
 
Transfe rring  levels  gets more challenging  with the CAD , JPY, and CHF F utures because the 
correlation is -100 % , which means the charts  are inverse . Also , one pip on Futures doesn't 
equal one pip on Forex. With CAD , JPY, and CHF futures , I still transfer the level s "visually ," 
but you need to imagine the Forex chart is reversed. It takes some time and effort  to do this 
a few times a day , but with some practice , you will be able to do it quickly.  It’s very similar to 
learning to ride a bike; once your brain gets it, it gets it!  

19 
  
 
Order Flow – Market Participants  
Most people get confused when they open a n Order Flow chart for the very first time. There 
is no shame in that. Order Flow shows so much  information that it is easy to get overwhelmed 
if you don’t know what to look for!  Don’t worry  though ; by the time you have finished this 
book , you will be able to read Order Flow without getting a headache :)  
Let’s start by going through the basic stuff , like what Order Flow shows and how to read it.  
 
Passive vs. Active (Aggressive ) Market Participants  
To learn what is going on in the Order Flow chart , you first need to understand one 
fundamental thing : the  distinction between passive  and active  market participants. This may 
sound like too much theory , but this piece of information is vital . If you are not sure you got 
it the first time, go through it again. If you don’t  get this  point  now, you will be lost later. 
Ready? Here we go!  
 

20 
 Passive Mark et Participants  
Passive  market participants are traders who enter their trade with a limit (pending) order.  
They do not chase the market. They wait for the price to come to them and then they enter 
their trades only for the price they want  (or better).  
Every subject in the market can be a passive participant. It does not matter if it is a bank, a 
pension fund, a hedge fund, or a private trader like you or me . It is mere ly everybody who 
enters a trade with a limit order.  If you place a limit order in your trading platform,  you are a 
passive market participant.  
When the price hits the limit order  you placed in the market, the order  gets filled , and you 
get into  the trade (you have just opened a trading position). This trading position will show 
on the Order Flow footprint.  
If you open a LONG position with a limit order, then it will appear on the BID side of the 
footprint (on the left).  
If you opened a SHORT position with a limit order, then it will appear on the ASK side of the 
footprint (on the right) . 
 
So far , so good?  This will make things a bit more complicated : 
 

21 
 Active Market Participants  
Active market participants are traders who enter their trade s with market order s. If you press 
a market Buy or Sell, then you are an active market participant. Your position will get filled 
immediately.  
No matter where the price currently is, no matter where exactly the trade is going to be filled, 
aggressive participants  just want in. Now!  Even if thi s means risking a slippage (the trade 
won’t open precise ly at the price where they pressed the Buy/Sell).  
A market order is useful in situations where there is no time to wait to get your whole position 
filled exactly at the price you wanted. For example, this could be when there is a quick price 
movement that  you don’t want to miss.  
If you open a LONG position with a market order, it will appear on the ASK side of the 
footprint (on the right).  
If you open a SHORT position with a market order, it will appear on the  BID side of the 
footprint (on the left).  
 
 

22 
 Active and Passive in One Chart  
The distinction between passive and aggressive market participants is what makes so many 
people confused . It is the main reason they cannot use Order Flow properly and struggle to 
make  money with it , which is why I stress the importance of this point!  
Let me give you two more pictures  that sum this up. If you are not 100% confident with where 
the passive and aggressive traders show  on the footprint , then I suggest you print those  
pictures  where you can see them  while trading. 
The picture below  shows two identical footprint s and the two ways you can inter pret  them . 
 
Let me put all that into one footprint that sums this all up:  
 

23 
 What the picture above says is this:  
• BID: Shows aggressive Sellers  and passive Buyers . 
• ASK (Offer): Shows aggressive Buyers  and passive Sellers . 
If you understood this, then your first question will probably be, “How am I supposed to know 
if the number that just appeared on the ASK is from a p assive Seller or an aggressive Buyer?”  
I am afraid y ou will not  like the answer  as there is no way to know with absolute certainty ! 
The good news is , in this book , I am going to teach you how to make a reasonable  estimate , 
which will allow you to make the correct assumption  in most cases. Not in all cases —I do not 
teach magic as I wa rned you already .  
 
Bigger Perspective (BONUS)  
To put things into a bigger perspective , let me show you one more thing. Maybe you have 
seen some Volume Profile indicators with  two colors and the developers told you that one 
color shows Sellers and the other color shows Buyers.  Like this one, for example:  
 
If somebody tells you such a thing,  then they clearly don’t know what they are talking about.  

24 
 Based on what I just taught you, you now know that when volumes appear on BID, they can 
be both aggressive  Sellers or passive Buyers. And when volumes appear on  the ASK, they can 
be both aggressive Buyers or passive Sellers! If somebody tells you that “green” means  Buyers 
and “red” means  Sellers , they are telling you a half -truth . 
 
Order Flow – Basic Chart Description  
In this chapter, I am going to describe standard Order Flow software and describe its primary  
interface. You can apply this to most of the common Order Flow software as the core should 
be the same for each of them . 
 
Footprints  
The Order Flow does not show standard candles, but it shows FOOTPRINTS.  
A footprint shows not only Open, High, Low, Close as standard candles  do, but it also shows 
orders  that got traded within  that candle.  
Orders are placed on Bid or on Ask.  When a BUYER enters a Long trade  (with a market order), 
then his position  shows on the ASK side of the footprint.  When a SELLER enters a Short trade 
(with a market order), his position  shows on BID.  
This is how the Order Flow chart is drawn : 
 

25 
 Green/Red Cells  
Inside every footprint there are green or red cells.  
The cell is GREEN if the number on the Ask is larger than the number on  the Bid.  
It is RED when the Bid is larger than the Ask.  
Simply put, t his represents the strength of Buyers versus Sellers.   
However, as you learned in the previous chapter, this is not always true , and there is much 
more to it. But for  the sake of keepin g this part simple, let’s leave it at that and revisit  it when 
we talk about Order Flow strategies.  
Usually (not always) , the bullish footprints are primarily  green (stronger Buyers) and the 
bearish footprints are primari ly red (stronger Sellers).  
 
 
High Volume Nodes (HVN)  
Possibly , the most important place in any footprint is the High Volume Node. It represents 
the place where the heaviest volumes were traded , a place where the institutions were the 
most active . It is marked by a black outline, making it easily visible at first sight.  
If there are more Heavy Volume Nodes at the same price , in two or more consecutive 
footprints, then my proprietary Order Flow software will make it in yellow . Price levels like 
these  represent Support/ Resistance zone s. 

26 
  
 
Delta  
Below each footprint  (the place could vary depending o n the software you use)  there is a 
number that is either green or red.  
It is GREEN (positive) when more volume is  executed at the Ask ( in that whole footprint).  
It is RED (negative) when more volume is  executed at the Bid (in that whole footprint).  
This essentially  tells you who is stronger in that footprint —Buyers or Sellers.  Bullish footprints 
have a positive Delta (GREEN). Bearish footpr ints typically have a negative delta  (RED).  This 
holds true primarily in trending markets .  
If there is  a rotation, then you cannot rely on this as much. The reason is that in a rotation, 
big institutions usually enter their trades both with market and pending orders. They combine 
these two types of orders in an effort to mask their true intentions.  

27 
  
What should grab your attention is when you see a bullish footprint with a negative Delta or 
a bearish footprint with a positive Delta.  
A bullish footprint with a negative Delta tells you this: The price is rising, but Sellers are 
entering their Shorts and they are stronger than  the Buyers.   
A bearish footprint with a positive  Delta tells you this: The price is falling, but Buyers are 
enterin g their Longs and they are stronger than  the sellers.  
Both those scenarios represent a warning that a price reversal might  happen (price reverses 
to follow Delta).  
 
 
EXAMPLE : Price and Delta Divergence  
Let me give you an example o f a trade I had a couple o f days ago on EUR Futures:  
1. I had identified a strong  level of  Resistance on  the EUR/USD using Volume Profile. I 
published this Resistance  level  a week ago publicly on my website.  
2. I waited almost a week until the price reached this Resistance.  

28 
 3. When it did, there was a strong uptrend the whole day. It would be risky to enter a 
Short trade from Resistance against this strong uptrend. For this reason, I used my 
Order Flow software to identify precisely when Sellers  started showing  up around this 
Resistance.  
4. In the Order Flow, I looked at 6E 12 -20 instrument, which is EUR futures. It 100% 
correlates with EUR/USD (Forex) , where I place my trades . The reason I looked at 
Futures was that I needed to see  the separate  Bid x Ask  volumes  and Delta (which 
Forex does not show).  
5. When the price reached the volume -based Resistance , there was a significant 
divergence between price and Delta. Price was rising,  but Delta was falling! This meant 
that even though the price was going up, strong and aggressive Sellers were jumping 
in more and more! This is one of my favorite trade confirmations, so I jumped in the 
Short trade.  
6. I took a 10 pip Take Profit  quite easil y. I did n’t want to try to take more out of this 
because the EUR was in a strong uptrend. Trading Shorts against a strong uptrend is 
risky, so it was better to take a small er profit and quit the trade.  
This is what I saw when I entered the short trade ( price rising, Delta negative) .  
* BTW. This picture shows footprints with Total Volumes (sum of Bid + Ask) . 
 

29 
 This was the reaction:  
 
There was a bit more to this trade, which I will not mention here  for the sake of simpli city. 
What I wan t you to focus on is the divergence between rising prices and falling Delta. That 
was what predicted the turning of the price.  
If you would like to see the whole trade and how it went in real -time, then you can watch the 
video where I recor ded it  all. It is on my website , and you can access it using the link and 
password I gave you at the beginning of this book.  Enjoy!  
 
Footprint Summary  
The panel at the bottom of the Order Flow chart shows a summary of each footprint.  
You can set it in any way you want to show only  the information you need for your strategy. 
It is best not to have too much summary info there and solely focus on the most important  
things.  
Here is a picture that shows the whole summary panel:  

30 
  
Such a panel is quite standard for much  Order Flow software. Developers like to boast of how 
many useful things it shows. T he truth is you won’t need all those  features as they distract 
from the more critical aspects . I personally only use Delta, Cumulative Delta , and Volume.  It 
gives me this quick overview info:  
Delta : Shows whether there were stronger Buyers or Sellers.  
Cumulative Delta : Shows Delta changes throughout the whole day.  
Volume : Shows the accumulative  volume of each footprint.  
The scr eenshot below shows my summary settings:  
 

31 
 Volume Profile  
My Order Flow software has its own Volume Profile.  It is a Daily Volume Profile that shows 
the volume distribution throughout the whole day.  
This is a signific ant feature because it shows you the bigger picture, which is critical when 
trading with Order Flow!   
The BLUEISH/GREEN color on the Volume Profile represents orders traded on  the Ask, and 
the RED color represents orders traded on  the Bid. 
Combining Volume Profile with Order Flow is my favorite intraday trading approach. I will talk 
more about it later in this book.  
 
  

32 
 TD Order Flow – Special Features  
Here I will continue describing more useful Order Flow features. But this time , the features 
won’t be standard; instead, they are unique to my Order Flow software.  
 
Order Flow for Forex  
One of my Order Flow software's most unique features  is that you can use it for trading Forex. 
This is not very common because Order Flow is primarily used  with centralized data (Futures).  
Still, NinjaTrader  has a good Forex data feed with reliable volume information. We were able 
to use this and adjust the Order Flow to work even with Forex!  
The Forex data  they  prov e does not give Bid and Ask  volume , only Total  Volume (=  sum of Bid 
and Ask). For this reason , you cannot use all the Order Flow functions when trading Forex  
(functions using Bid and Ask) . Still , the Volume data is extremely useful , and the Order Flow 
gives you a tremendous  edge even without  separate  Bid and Ask  volume . 
Order Flow used with Forex Volume data looks like this:  
 
Every cell shows volumes that were traded at the given price level ; the heavier the volume  at 
a given price point  the darker the shade.  

33 
 Volume Clusters  
When trading with the Order Flow , it is very important to pay atten tion to heavy volume areas 
as well as  low volume areas. This would be almost impossible if you just looked at the numbers 
in each cell  without having any visual help.  
For this reason, I designed my software to recognize heavy volumes and use darker colors to 
make the heavy volume  areas  stand out. This way , you can immediately identify heavy volume 
areas at a glance . 
When there is an area that is way darker than the surrounding areas,  it marks a place where 
the BIG trading institutions and their algorithms were most likely actively trading.  
Those are critical  areas to keep track of as they often represent strong Support and Resistance  
zones.  
 
Those darker and lighter shades  are also used on the Bid x Ask visualization as you can see in 
the chart that follows.  
 
 
 

34 
 The heavier the volumes the darker the color:  
 
 
Multiple High Volume Nodes (HVN)  
A very important place in every footprint is the High Volume Node. It is the place where most 
of the volumes got traded (Bid and Ask combined).  
An e xtremely strong  level is formed when two or more High Volume Nodes meet at the same 
price in consecutive footprints. When two nodes meet , I call it a Double Node, when it is three 
nodes, then a Triple Node, etc … 
My software automatically detects those Multiple HVNs and h ighlights them in yellow. This 
way, you can quickly identify them at  first sight.  
Those Multiple HVNs are very significant  in my Order Flow analysis because they often 
represent strong  Support and Resistance zones.  

35 
  
 
Imbalances  
Imbalances are a great way of tracking  market sentiment. Only with Order Flow will you be 
able to  see this type of market detail!  
An Imbalance is when Buyers are way more aggressive than Sellers or when Sellers are more 
aggressive than Buyers . 
If Buyers are way more aggressive than Sellers  (Ask is 300% or larger  than  the Bid), then the 
number on  the Ask is printed in BLUE.  
If Sellers are more aggressive than Buyers  (Bid is 300% or larger  than  the Ask) , then the 
number on the Bid is printed in BLUE.  
Bid x Ask Order Flo w is compared  diagonally, which means that Imbalances are compared as 
shown below (this is also how you read the Order Flow footprint —diagonally):  

36 
  
The picture above shows two Imbalances . One Imbalance is  in the second row and the other 
one is in the thir d. The reason is: 13 is 300% or more than 2, and 61 is 300% or more than 14.  
You will often see Imbalances at the start of a strong and aggressive trend  and within the 
trend itself.  
 
 
Stacked Imbalances  
Stacked Imbalances are three or more cells with imbalances on top of each other. Learning to 
spot these areas is extremely important to us traders  because they often represent strong 
Support and Resistance zones.  

37 
 Stacked Imbalances are a sign that one side  of the market ( Buyers or Sellers) is dominating 
and in control. Those Buyers or Sellers are really strong, aggressive , and determined to push 
the price their way.  
My Order Flow software automatically highlights areas with Stacked Imbalances. Those areas 
represent strong Support and Resistance zones.  
 
 
Unfinished Business  
Another unique feature of my Order Flow software is that it automatically detects Unfinished 
Businesses (Failed Auctions).  
Unfinished Business represents a market imperfection. It shows that the high or low , which 
was just formed,  was not formed properly.  
What do I mean by “formed properly”?  
Every footprint represents an auction process. This process needs to end in a certain way. A 
properly formed high needs to hav e 0 contracts traded at the B id, and a properly formed Low 
needs to have 0 contracts traded on  the Ask. 

38 
 When the market turns from a new low or high without this happening, it is called Unfinished 
Business (or  a Failed Auction).  
It is an imperfection that the market tends  to fix. The price has a tendency to revisit  such 
places and “finish the business .” You can think of these areas as a sort of magnet to the price.  
My Order Flow automatically detects these areas and draws a line there. This line is left in 
place until the price revisits  it and fixes this market imperfection.   
 
Let me give you a live trading example from one of my recent trades on EUR Futures.  
 
EXAMPLE: Unfinished Business  
I was in a Short trade, and I was deciding whether to take a 10 pip profit or take a half profit 
at both 10 and 20 pips . Because there was Unfinished Business where the chart had previously 
turned , I decided to take just the 10 pi p profit . It would have been risky to try to go for more 
because the Unfinished Business could work like a magnet and drive the price upwards 
(against my Short).  
 
 

39 
 Here is a screenshot from the live session video:  
 
The picture shows the Unfinished Business (the green dotted line) and a red arrow, which I 
drew to demonstrate what could happen there.  
Later, the Unfinished Business did end up  work ing as a magnet , and the price went upwards 
to test it  as shown here : 
 
This allowed me to quit the trade  with a profit  before the price would  have  turn ed against 
me. 
 

40 
 The first thing many people think when they hear about Unfinished Business is that this is the 
Holy Grail . Unfortunately , it does not work like that. The reason  is that t he price could move 
quite a significant  distance away from the Unfinished Business without actually testing it.  
In my trading , I don’t rely on  the Unfinished Business indicator too much. Instead of a Holy 
Grail , I consider it a small helper when  making trading decisions as in the trade illustrated 
above . 
 
Trades Filter  
This unique feature filters out all the noise from the market and leaves only the biggest trades 
(trades of the BIG guys we want to track).  
It makes the Order Flow easy to read , and you can be sure you won’ t miss any significant 
market  action! When the BIG guys are present, it will show on the Trades Filter.  
You can set the Filter anyway you like —depending on how much “noise” you want to filter 
out. I personally prefer to set it in a way that only the most significan t trading orders show.  
This means that on EUR Futures (my favorite day trading instrument) I have the Trades Filter 
set to 25. This means it only shows executed trades that were 25+ contracts.  
You may  say that 25 contr acts are not that much and you are right. But you need to consider 
this: I nstitutions prefer to enter their trading positions using Iceberg orders. This means that 
they open positions with multiple orders rather than with one single order like a retail tra der. 
But when there is not much time , and the institutions need to get into their trade quickly, 
they don’t have the luxury of Iceberg orders and they need to enter their trades  using bigger 
position  sizes . Those larger orders  are the ones we track with the Trades Filter.  
Later in this book , I will show you a n excellent  trading strategy based solely on the Trades 
Filter.  
41 
  
 
Cumulative Delta  
This is a separate indicator , which is usually not a part of Order Flow software. But it  works so 
nicely  with the Order Flow that it would be a shame not to use these two together!  For this 
reason, I decided to add this standalone indicator to my Order Flow software so you can use 
them together.  
The Cumulative Delta prints the difference betw een the Bid and Ask . You can think of it this 
way (even though it is not 100% correct , as you have already learned): Cumulative Delta 
identifies the difference between Buyers and Sellers.  
If there are more aggressive Buyers jumping in, then the Cumulative Delta is rising. If there 
are more aggressive Sellers than Buyers , then it is falling.  
It is best to watch the Cumulative Delta around strong Support and Resistance zones. If strong 
Buyers or Sellers start to enter their trading positions there, the n Delta  will show you!  
What I really like is to look for divergences between price and Delta on the 1 Minute chart.  
 

42 
 EXAMPLE:  Cumulative Delta  
The price is heading downwards, but the Cumulative Delta is going up. This tells me that even 
though the price  is going down, there are Buyers entering Long and the price will most likely 
reverse and turn upwards.  
It is best to look for price x Delta divergences around Support and Resistance zones.  
 
  

43 
 Order Flow – Trading Workspace  
Since you now know what the Order Flow shows and you are familiar with its major features, 
let me show you what  my trading workspace looks like. You can set yours  up exactly the same 
way as I have it. If you shoot me an email (contact @trader -dale.com) I ca n also send you my 
workspaces so you don’t need to set them up yourself.  
Let me now show you what  my Order Flow screen looks like:  
 
My Order Flow screen shows four charts. Those charts are linked together so they always 
show the same trading instrument.  
 
Top left chart:  This one shows the bigger picture. It shows  the 30 Minute footprint. The cells 
in each footprint show “total cell volume ” (Bid + Ask). Below each footprint (the green or red 
number) is the footprint’s Delta.  
On the left side , there is the Daily Volume Profile. In the summary below , I have Delta, 
Cumulative Delta, and Volume.  
Top right chart:  This one is a more detailed chart  for spotting the orders as they are filled in 
the market. I use it for trade entries and exits. It is a 5 Minute chart , which shows  the Bid and 

44 
 Ask in each cell.  Each footprint also has Delta printed below. The trade summary at the 
bottom shows Delta, Cum ulative Delta, and Volume.  
Bottom left chart:  30 Minute Order Flow chart with Trades Filter and Daily Volume Profile on 
the left.  I use this chart to filter out the noise and to look for the big trading orders.  
Bottom right chart:  Shows 1 Minute price char t at the top and 1 Minute Cumulative Delta 
chart at the bottom.  
 
This workspace allows me to see all the important things that are going on in the market.  
I can see the big picture with the 30 Minute Volume chart and Trades Filter as well as the 
more granu lar details on the 5 Minute Bid x Ask chart and on the Cumulative Delta chart.  
  
45 
 Order Flow – Trading Setups  
In this section , I am going to show you five of my favorite Order Flow trading setups. You can 
trade th ese as stand alone setup s, which means that they are strong just on their own. There 
is no need to combine them with any other setup , nor do you need to  look for any additional  
trading confirmation (you can do that, but it is not a must).  Let’s get to it then!  
 
Trading Setup #1: Volume Cluster s 
This setup  is based on trading significant areas of heavy volume  (Volume Clusters) , which 
occurred either in a trend  or in a strong rejection  of higher/lower prices .  
Such heavy  volume areas are places where the BIG guys (institutions) and their trading 
algorithms placed a large portion of their orders.  
Let’s first talk about the situation when the Volume Cluster occurred within a trend.  
*This strategy does not use Bid x Ask, onl y the Volume setting. Because of this , you can trade 
it also on Forex (still, I recommend doing your analysis on Future s). 
 
Volume Clusters (within a TREND)  
The exact steps to follow are:  
1. Set your Order Flow software to show Volumes (not Bid x Ask). This w ill make it way 
easier to identify heavy volume zones. This way , the Order Flow will show shades of 
grey and the heavy volume areas will stand out more.  
2. Find a trend and look for dark grey areas (heavy Volume Clusters ) that stand out. 
Those areas represent  heavy volumes (institutional activity).  
3. You need to see the price move away from the Volume Cluster , making at least one or 
two whole footprints (candles) above or below the heavy volume area . I like to use  
the 30 Minute footprint  chart  for this.  
4. Then yo u need to wait for a pullback. When the price returns back to this heavy 
volume area, you enter your trade.  
46 
 5. Your trade entry should be at the beginning of the Volume Cluster or at the place 
where the volumes were the heaviest (within that Volume Cluster).  
6. If the heavy volume area was formed in an uptrend, then you go Long. If it was formed 
in a downtrend, you would look to go  Short.  
 
 
LOGIC BEHIND THIS  
Let me describe the logic behind this setup with  the picture above. First, there was an 
uptrend , and Buyers were pushing the price upwards. Then they started to add massively 
to their Long positions (around 1.0880). We can see this place nicely with the Order 
Flow —that’s the Volume Cluster. From this place , the price continued to move upwards. 
The Buyers were still dominating the market and they were pushing the price up. When 
the price made it back into this Volume Cluster again, those Buyers wanted to defend their 

47 
 Long  position,  which they entered in the Volume Cluster. As a result , the Buyers  began  
aggressive ly buying again (with Market Orders) to push the price away from this critical  
level.  
Another aspect that helped  drive the price  upwards from the Volume Cluster was Sellers 
closing out  their Short trades. When the price made the pullback to the Volume Cluster, 
it was the Sellers who drove it there. Likely , those Sellers knew about the strong Volume 
Cluster  around 1.0880 . They knew that strong Buyers were adding to their Longs massively 
there  and that it was an impor tant level for them. So , instead of risking a fight with strong 
Buyers, the Sellers quit their Short trades as the price reache d the Volume Cluster. It’s 
important to understand that w hen Sellers close  their Short trades, they need to close  
them  with a Lon g order. In this case, t his add ed to the Longs of the aggressive Buyers who 
were defending the Volume Cluster.  
 
TWO  FACTORS  
In the end , two factors  drove the price upwards from the 1.0880 Volume Cluster : 
#1 factor:  Buyers defending their Long  Position  
#2 factor: S ellers quitting  or closing out  their Short  Position  
We can’t really tell which of th ese factors play ed a bigger role (because both Buyers and 
Sellers use d Buy Market Orders —the same orders). The important thing is that both these 
factors were  pushing the price the same way —upwards.  
This kind of logic is also used in my other Order Flow trading setups. It does not apply only 
to the Volume Cluster setup.  
  
48 
 EXAMPLES: Volume Clusters  (within a TREN D) 
Let me follow with a couple of examples  of the Volume Cluster setup : 
Example #1: Volume Cluster (within a trend)  
 
 
Example #2: Volume Cluster (within a trend)  
 

49 
 Example #3: Volume Cluster (within a trend)  
 
 
Example #4: Volume Cluster (within a trend)  
 

50 
 Volume Cluster (within a REJECTION ) 
This is very similar to the previous trading setup. The only difference is that (in step 2) you 
look for the significant Volume Cluster in a strong rejection of lower or higher prices  (not in a 
trend).  
A strong rejection of higher prices is when the price goes aggressively upwards and then it 
suddenly turns and goes into a rapid sell -off (= higher prices got rejected). A rejection of lower 
prices is the same, only reversed.  
The picture below shows a strong rejection of higher prices:  
 
 
Here is the complete guide step by step:  
1. Set your Order Flow software to show Volumes (not Bid x Ask). This will make it way 
easier to identify heavy volume zones. This way , the Order Flow will show in shades 
of grey and the heavy volume areas will stand out more.  
2. Find a strong rejection of higher or lower prices and look for dark grey areas ( Volume 
Clusters ) that stand out. Those show heavy volumes (institutional activity).  
3. You need to see the price move away from the Volume Cluster  making at least one or 
two whole footprints (candles) above or below this area. I like to use  the 30 Minute 
footprint  chart  for this.  
4. Then you need to wait for a pullback. When the price returns ba ck to the Volume 
Cluster , you enter your trade.  

51 
 5. If the Volume Cluster  got formed in a rejection of lower prices, you  look to  go Long (in 
the direction of the rejection). If there was a rejection of higher prices, you  look to  
take a Short trade.  
 
The logic  behind this setup is the same as with the Volume Clusters in a trend  mentioned 
earlier . In this case, the strong Buyers entered much of their  position in the Volume Cluster 
created during  the initial  rejection. As the price later retested this area , those Buyers were 
defending their Longs and Sellers abandoned  their Shorts.

Example #2: Volume Cluster (within a rejection)

 Example #3: Volume Cluster ( within a rejection)  
 
 
Example #4: Volume Cluster (within a rejection)  
 
 

54 
 Trading Setup #2: Multiple Nodes  
This setup is designed to track institutional trading activity  using the High Volume Nodes 
(HVN). The HVN shows where the heaviest volumes were traded within one footprint by 
creating a black outline around that cell.  
 
This setup focuses on  finding two consecutive footprints that have their HVNs at the same 
price level —this is what I call the “Multiple  Node .” This tells us that in both these footprints 
the most important price level was the same . Therefore , we can assume that this level is 
important.  
In this setup, the minimum number of footprints with HVNs next to each other is two. If there 
are more, then the level is even stronger.  
I look for the Multiple Nodes in these significant areas:  
• Within  a trend  
• Before  a trend  
• In a strong rejection of higher/lower prices  
This trading setup  does not use Bid x Ask, so you can apply it to spot Forex as well  (I still 
recommend Futures thoug h). 
 
The concrete steps to trading the Multiple Nodes setup are:  
1. Set your Order Flow so it shows Volumes ( this is only my preference. You can also use 
Bid x Ask setting ). My preferred time frame is  the 30 Minute  chart . 

55 
 2. Identify a place where there are more HVNs next to each other  (= Multiple Node) . This 
place needs to form before the start of the trend , within a trend, or in a strong 
rejection of higher/lower prices.  
3. There need to be at least two whole footprints formed AFTER the Multiple Node was 
formed.  Those footprints need to be completely above or below the Multiple Node.  
4. Wait for a pullback to the Multiple Node.  
5. Enter a trade. If the price hits the Multip le Node from above, then go Long. If the price 
hits the Multiple Node from below, then go Short. Trade only the first touch (first test).

59 
 Trading setup #3: Trades Filter  
The Trades Filter  setting  is a unique feature of my Order Flow software. It enables you to filter  
out the market's noise and  display only the largest trading orders (the BIG guys). This simple 
strategy is based on following those big orders.  
You can set the Trades Filter in the indicator settings  to show only trades bigger than X lots. 
In the picture below , I put the filter to 25, which means it will only show trades with more 
than 25 lots  executed with ONE order (as I mentioned earlier , it won’t catch the I ceberg 
orders) . 
I currently use this setting with currency Futures (mainly EUR futures – 6E): 
 
 
Every trading instrument has its own specifics and different volumes. The 25 lot  setting  suits 
currency Futures, but it does not work,  for example , on the  ES (S&P 500 futures). There the 
number needs to be significantly higher —around 300 or more. Also , heavy volumes are 
traded only in the US session , so you won’t get any signals during the  EU or Asian session.  
You need to adjust this number to the instrument you’re trading and, in some cases, the time 
of day you’re trading as well . A rule of thumb here is to se t it to a number that gives you 
around 5 –10 trading signals per day.  
Let’s now talk about the setup  so all this becomes clear er.  
 
 
 
 

60 
 The setup  is very similar to Setup  #1: Volume Clusters. Here are the steps:  
1. Set your Order Flow to show B id x Ask. Then enable the Trades Filter in the Indicator 
settings and set the minimum trade size  (for EUR Futures , I use 25 lots ). 
2. Look for highlighted values (red/green) on the Trades Filter—values that are not 0 . 
Those are big trading orders that work as strong Support and Resistance zones.  
3. You need to see the price move away from such an  area first, making at least one or 
two whole footprints (candles) above or below this area. I like to use the 30 Minute 
footpr int for this.  
4. Then you need to wait for a pullback. When the price returns to this big order area, 
you enter your trade.  
5. If the price hit s this area from above, then you enter Long. If it makes a pullback from 
below, then you go Short.  Green does not mean you go Long and red does not mean 
you go Short!  
6. Trade only the first hit (first test). Don’t attempt to trade one trading level more than 
once,  as the probability of a 2nd successful reaction to the same level is smaller . 
 
You can trade this setup as a st andalone setup , or you can decide to trade it  after  you see the 
entry point gets confirmed  by any o f the “trade confirmation” setups taught in this book . 
*BTW – If you decide to use my Order Flow software , you will also receive my trading 
workspaces . This way , you actually won’t need to set the Trades Filter yourself.

 Trading setup #4: Stacked Imbalances  
An Imbalance means that one side of the market is way stronger than the other. Either the 
Buyers are way stronger than  the Seller s or the Sellers are much stronger than the Buyers . 
This “strength ” is measured by comparing the Bid and As k. The default setting of my software 
is that if Bid is 300% or more than  the Ask, it is marked (in blue color) as Selling Imbalance. If 
the Ask is 300% or more than  the Bid, it is a Buying Imbalance  (also in blue) . 
Selling Imbalances often occur in a downtrend and Buying Imbalances often show in an 
uptrend.  
Selling Imbalances occur at  the Bid; Buying Imbalances occur at  the Ask. 
 
You have the option to  turn on/off the imbalances as well as change th e trigger percentage 
in my Order Flow software  settings.  

65 
  
 
If there are multiple  Stacked Imbalances on top of each other, this represents a strong 
Support/Resistance zone. It indicates  that either Buyers or Sellers were really active and 
strong at this place. It also implies that when the price comes back into this area again, it is 
likely that those Strong Buyers/Sellers will become active again . We can expect  that there will 
be a reac tion.   
 
The way to trade this is very similar to the previous setups:  
1. Set your Order Flow to show B id x Ask. Make sure you have the Imbalances turned  
“on” in the Indicator settings.  
2. If there are more than three Buying or Selling Imbalances stacked on top o f each other  
(default setting, which you can change) , then it represents a Stacked Imbalance and 
this zone will automatically get highlighted. A Support  zone created by Stacked Buying  
Imbalances gets highlighted in green . A Resistance  zone  created by Stack ed Selling  
Imbalances gets highlighted in red. 
3. You need to see the price move away from these highlighted areas  first, making at 
least one or two whole footprints (candles) above or below it. I like to use  the 30 
Minute footprint  chart  for this.  

66 
 4. Then you need to wait for a pullback. When the price returns back to this Stacked 
Imbalance zone , then you enter your tra de. 
5. If the price hit this zone  from above, then you enter Long. If it makes a pullback from 
below, then you go Short.  An a rea highlighted in red  = Resistance . An a rea highlighted 
in green  = Support.  
6. Trade only the first hit (first test). Don’t attempt to t rade one trading level more than 
once  as the probability of a second successful reaction to the same level is much lower . 
7. It is best to look for Stacked Imbalances within a trend or before a trend  begins . 
Additionally, it does not need to be a strong trend ; a strong one -way price movement  
will do .

 Trading setup #5: Unfinished Business  
Unfinished Business represents a market imperfection. It shows that when the price  changed 
its direction , the high or low it created  did not  form properly.  
There is an  Auction process  when a new high/low is formed , and t his process needs to end in 
a certain way. A properly formed high needs to have 0 contracts traded at Bid, and a properly 
formed Low needs to have 0 contracts traded at Ask. 
When the market turns from a new low or high without this happening  (Bid AND Ask are both 
more  than 0 ), it is called an Unfinished Business (or a Failed Auction).   
My software makes this easy to spot by drawing a dotted green or red line there:  
 
Now I am going to show you a fe w tips for how you can use Unfinished Business. I don’t have 
a trading setup based  solely on trading Unfinished Business;  instead, I use it primarily to 
support other trade setups . 
The main thing to remember about Unfinished Business is that it works like a magnet. The 
price is drawn towards it , and if it comes close, it is likely to move  through  it. 

71 
 So, if Unfinished Business  works as a magnet, how do we use this information? There are 
several ways:  
• Take Profit  
• Stop Loss  
• Confirmation  
• Warning against bad trades  
 
Take Profit  
If you are in a profitable trade  and you are thinking about taking your profit , you can check if 
the price is moving  towards Unfinished Business . If it is, then yo u might  remain in your 
position a little bit longer until the price tests the Unfinished Business —because it should 
work as a magnet. This can help you to stretch your Take Profit by a few pips. Be careful , 
though,  as there is no guarantee the market will test the Unfinished Business if it is too far 
away . This technique for extending your take profit works best  if the price is  already  close to 
the Unfinished Business.   
 
I was using this method in a live trading vi deo, which you can find on the webpage I made for 
you (https://www.trader -dale.com/of -book/ ) 

72 
 This particular video is called “ LIVE : Trading JPY Futures  - Trailing Position and Delta 
Divergence .” 
 
Stop Loss  
When you are deciding  where to place your Stop Loss, bear in mind that Unfinished Business 
works like a magnet. If you place your SL in a way that the Unfinished Business is behind it, 
then if the price comes close to your SL , it will most likely  shoot past it —to test the Unfinished  
Business.  
 
I am not saying I always stick to these rules  regarding the Unfinished Business as this is not 
my main trading strategy.  I use  Unfinished Business  mostly to read the charts , feel what is 
going on, and make the best picture of what I expect to occur . No trade is perfect , and there 
will always be something you won’t like. But you need to weigh the pros and cons and decide 
in the end whether the trade is worth taking the risk . 
 
Confirmation  
Bearing in mind that Unfinished Business works as a magnet, you can also use it to confirm a 
trend. Imagine you are in a Long position and the price goes upwards but then it reverses and 

73 
 it starts going against you. Unfinished Business can help you identif y whether this is most 
likely just a pullback or if this is a change of a trend. If you see Unfinished Business at the top 
of the reversal, then the price probably turned temporarily. It will likely  continue upwards 
again to test the Unfinished Business (m agnet).   
 
 
I also used this approach in the live trading session video called “ LIVE: Trading JPY Futures  - 
Trailing Position and Delta Divergence .” (https://www.trader -dale.com/of -book/ ) 
 
Warning agains t Entering  a Bad Trade  
The Unfinished Business can also warn you against entering a bad trade. Again, the logic is 
that Unfinished Business works as a magnet , and if the price comes close, it will most likely 
test it.  
Simply put, you don’t want to enter a Long trade when there is the Unfinished Business below  
and you don’t want to enter a Short trade when there is the Unfinished Business above your  
entry . 
Why? Because Unfinished Business works as a magnet , and by entering such a trade you 
would risk the price shooting  past your trade entry to test the Unfinished Business.  

74 
  
 
Below  are some more examples of Unfinished Business. Notice how the price has  the 
tenden cy to hit those areas and fix the market imperfection th at Unfinished Business 
represents.

78 
 Example #7: Unfinished Business  
 
 
Even though I spent quite a lot of space  talking about various uses of Unfinished Business, I 
would still advi se you to focus on the other  setups first. Those are standalone and proven 
trading setups. Unfinished Business is something extra —a bonus. It is an approach that only 
helps you read the market and helps with your decision -making . Your trading should be based 
on other stra tegies , and Unfinished Business should be used as an addition to that.  
  

79 
 Order Flow – Confirmations  
Confirmation setups are not standard trading setups. You should not base your trading 
strategy on them alone . Their strength lies in giving you a hint when the market is starting to 
react to a Support/Resistance zone you found using one of your main tradin g setups . That 
would be a setup  based on Volume Profile  or one of the setups  I showed you in t he previous 
chapter.  
This is how it works:   
First, go through the chart and identify the Support and Resistance zones. You can do this 
with Volume Profile , Order Flow main setups, or identify S/R zones another way you are 
familiar with . 
After that , mark those S/R zones in your chart. Then wait until the price makes it there . When 
it does, switch to Order Flow , and wait for a confirmation.  
It is important to note  that Support and Resistance are ZONES , NOT EXACT levels. When the 
price reaches such a zone, you want to see a confirmation there , somewhere within that zone. 
Such a confirmation tells you that the BIG guys (institutions) are starting to react there.  
There are four  confirmations I like to use. These  can give you the final push  to enter your 
trade.  
I also like to use the se confirmations when I am unsure whether  or not  to take a trade . This 
can be , for example , because the price moves  very quickly and aggressively agains t my trading 
level or the trading level i s not really clear (not clear where exactly to place it) . I also use 
confirmations  when my trading level is not particularly strong and I am not sure whether to 
trade it or not.  
In all such  situations , Order Flow confirmation can help you decide whether  to take the trade 
or skip it.  
There are four confirmations I look for when the price  reaches a significant Support or 
Resistance zone. I look for: Big Limit Orders, Absorption, a sign of Aggressive Buyers/Sellers , 
and confirmation on the Cumulative Delta.   
80 
 Confirmation Setup  #1: Big Limit Orders  
When the price reaches a strong Support/Res istance zone , you need to  see a sign of a reaction 
first.  This sign could be a BIG institution  jumping in to the market . 
You want to see somebody big who has been waiting around the S/R zone  (like you have been) 
to jump in the trade.  
Passive  traders who wait for the price to come to them use Limit order s. They don’t chase the 
market with aggressive Market orders. A Limit order is more suitable  because they get filled 
for the price THEY want.  
The Li mit Confirmation Strategy is quite simple. First, y ou identify a significant S/R zone  (for 
example , with Volume Profile) . Then you wait and look for  somebody big to jump in a trade 
there.  
• To get a Resistance zone confirmed , you need  to see a Limit Sell order appear.  
• To get a Support zone confirmed, you need to see a Limit Buy order appear.  
 
Important : a Limit Sell shows on the Ask and a  Limit Buy shows on  the Bid. 
 
 

81 
 Steps to Limit Orders Confirmation Setup : 
1. Identify a strong Support/Resistance zone using your primary  strategy (this could be 
Volume Profil e, Order Flow, Price Action , etc .). 
2. When the price gets to that zone, open  your  Order Flow and wait for a big Limit order 
(unusually large  volumes) to appear. For a Shor t trade confirmation, you want to see 
a large  number on  the Ask. For a Long trade confirmation , it needs to appear on  the 
Bid. 
3. I prefer to look for such confirmations o n a 5 Minute Bid x Ask Order Flow chart.  
4. An important fact to r emember  is that unusually  large  volume is different for each 
trading instrument and each trading session! That’s why it is essential  to start trading 
with just one trading instrument . After you have mastered it, only then should you  
look to add another.   
5. Enter your trade as soon a s you identify the big Limit order. Sometimes it does not 
appear all at once , and it may take a few minutes until the whole order is placed.  
 
Below is  a EUR Futures, 5 Minute chart showing a Long trade confirmation.  If this occurred in 
a Support zone, it would be a confirmation to enter a Long trade immediately . 
 

82 
 Below is  a EUR Futures, 5 Minute chart showing a Short trade confirmation.  If this occurred 
in a Resistance zone, it would be a confirmation to enter a Short  trade immediately.  
 
 
More examples of the Limit order confirmation  are below . To reiterate for emphasis , the 
confirmation must appear around a Support/Resistance zone , NOT  just anywhere ! I will show 
you how to identify S/R zones using Volume Profile later in this book .

 Example #3: Big Limit Orders  
 
 
Example #4: Big Limit Orders  
 
 

85 
 Example #5: Big Limit Orders  
 
Example #6: Big Limit Orders  
 

86 
 Confirmation Setup #2: Absorption  
This confirmation setup  is similar to the Limit order setup , only  a bit simpler . 
In this case, the confirmation you want to see in a Support /Resistance zone is Buyers or Sellers 
who absorb all the market momentum.  
Imagine , for example, that Sellers are pushing the price downwards using  aggressive Market 
Sell orders. But then  strong Buyers appear, and they absorb all the selling pressure —all the  
selling momentum . They buy everything the Sellers are selling. The price does not drop 
anymore , and heavy volumes start to appear. Those heavy volumes appear on  the BID 
(aggressive Sellers) a nd ASK (aggressive Buyers).  
So, when you see huge volumes traded  on the B id and A sk (both!) around some S/R zone, 
then it is most likely the Absorption  taking place . What is happening there is that t he Selling 
or Buying pressure (momentum) is getting absorbed , making a price reversal likely . That’s the 
confirmation you want to see!  
 
 
It is also hard to provide an exact definition of the term  “unusually large  volumes” as they  are 
different for every trading instrument and trading session. With that said, a simple technique  
you can use is  to look at recen t Order Flow footprints and determine an average cell volume . 
An “unusual ly large ” or “huge ” volume would be volume way above this average . 

87 
 An important thing to keep in mind is  that this large volume doesn’t appear all at once . It can 
take a while before you can safely tell that the volumes you see jumping in are unusually large 
compared to the average . 
 
Steps of the  Absorption Setup : 
1. Identify a strong Support/Resistance zone using your main strategy (this could be 
Volume Profi le strateg ies, Price Action strategy,  etc.). 
2. When the price gets near that S/R zone, open your Order Flow chart and wait for 
unusually heavy volumes to appear on Bid and Ask (both!) . The absorption needs to 
appear around the S/R zone. If it does, then the S/R zone is confirmed.  
3. Enter your trade as soon as you identify the Absorption. It may take a few minutes 
until all the orders on Bid and Ask are placed  before  you can safely tell that the market 
is absorbing the Buying/ Selling pressure.  
I prefer to look f or the Absorption on the 5 Minute chart or on a 30 Minute chart.

Example # 6: Absorption  
 

91 
 Confirmation Setup #3: Aggressive Orders and Delta  
A really nice confirmation is when you spot  aggressive market participants joining the party 
around a strong Support/Resistance zone . 
For example , imagine the price  moving  upwards, enter ing a Resistance zo ne, and then 
aggressive Sellers start to appear. This is a typical indication  that the price will most likely turn 
downwards.  
If the price enters a Resistance zone and you see big volumes starting to appear on Bid, then 
it is a confirmation  that a ggressive Sellers are jumping in.  
If the price enters a Support zone and you see big volumes starting to appear on Ask, then it 
is conf irmation  that a ggressive Buyers are jumping in.  
Aggressive Buyers show on Ask and aggressive Sellers show on Bid.  
It looks like this : 
 
 
Those aggressive Buyers/Sellers reveal to you  that they see the Support/Resistance as well as 
you do and that they wan t to trade it. They don’t want to miss this trading opportunity . In 
order not to miss it,  they need to enter their trade with a Market order. With a Market order 
they can be 100% sure their trading order will get filled.  

92 
 You can look for aggressive Buyers or Sellers by reading individual cells within each footprint 
(for this , I prefer 5 Minute footprints) . Another  way to get a quick picture of what is going on 
in the footprint  is the Delta.  
 
Delta  
Delta shows a sum of Bid and Ask for each footprint.  
If the Delta below the footprint is negative, then more volumes were traded at the Bid. This 
means that a ggressive Sellers dominated in that given footprint. The opposite goes for  a 
positive Delta . A positive  Delta  tells us that there were more volumes traded on  the Ask and 
that aggressive Buyers dominated that footprint . 
Delta shows below each footprint with my Order Flow indicator either as a negative red 
number  or as a positive green number.  
 
 
 
 
 
 

93 
 Steps to Aggressive Orders + Delta Setup : 
1. Identify a strong Support/Resistance zone using your main strategy (this could be a 
Volume Profile strategy, Price Actio n, etc.). 
2. When the price gets near that S/R zone, open your Order Flow chart (with Bid x Ask 
cell content  and 5 Minute ti me frame ) and look for aggressive orders.  
If the price entered a Resistance zone, y ou want to see aggressive Sell orders ( way 
larger  volumes on the Bid than the Ask). If the price reached Support, you wan t to see 
aggressive Buy orders ( way larger  volumes o n the Ask as compared to the  Bid).  
If Bid grows bigger than Ask or the other way around , it will also show on  the Delta.  It 
means that aggressive Buyers or Sellers star ted to jump in.  
For a Short trade confirmation , you want to see a negative Delta. For a Long trade 
confirmation , you want to see a positive Delta.  
3. When you recognize  that aggressive Buyers or Sellers have started to jump in and 
confirmed your Support/Resistance zone, you can immediately enter your trade.  
 
 
 

94 
 BONUS : Confirmation #1 or #2 Combined with Confirmation #3  
The best scenario you can ask for  is when there is a combination of two confirmations. The 
first confirmation you will see is either confirmation #1 (Limit order) or confirmation #2 
(Absorption) . The co nfirmation  that comes after is the one I have just shown you—the 
“Aggressive orders ” confirmation . 
This basically means that some large  passive market participant  was waiting for the 
Support/Resistance to get hit . Then  this big guy jumped in  (Limit order o r Absorption) , which 
caused a snowball effect and more people started to join in , this time more aggressively ( with 
Market orders) as they did not want to miss the opportunity.  
Here is an example:

98 
 Confirmation Setup #4: Cumulative Delta Divergence  
Before I describe  this strategy, let me first tell you the distinction  between Delta and 
Cumulative Delta .  
Delta  = Ask – Bid. 
Simply put , Delta is the  difference between Buyers and Sellers in each footprint.  
Cumulative Delta  is a sum of all Deltas since the beginning of the day. For example, if the 1st 
footprint has Delta = 30, the 2nd footprint has Delta = 100, and the 3rd footprint has Delta = -
50, then by the time the 3rd footprint finishes  printing, the Cu mulative Delta will be +80 
(30+100 -50). 
 
Here is an example:  
 
As you can see in the picture above, the Order Flow software automatically calculates the 
Cumulative Delta in the summary panel below the chart. This is a standard feature included 
with most  Order Flow software.  
 

99 
 However, there is an easier way to display the  Cumulative D elta. In my Order Flow software, 
you can print Cumulative Delta on a 1 Minute line chart , and this is how it looks:  
 
I recommend opening  a simple Price chart (1 Minute time frame)  atop the Cumulative Delta 
line chart . This way , you can easily compare price and Cumulative Delta movement , allowing 
you to spot divergences between the two much more easily . It looks like this:  
 

100 
 Let’s now talk about the strategy I like to use with the Cumulative Delta!  
 
Strategy Description  
This stra tegy is a confirmation strategy —I use it only around strong Support/Resistance zones 
to confirm my trade entries . I do not use it as a standalone strategy (even though I know 
people who quite successfully use it this way ). 
A significant  advantage of this strategy is that it is straightforward  to interpret and , therefore , 
very easy to use . Its simplicity  and reliability  is the reason why it’s so popular among  my 
students.  
 
Steps to Cumulative Delta Confirmation Setup : 
1. Identify a strong  Support/Resistance zone using your primary  strategy (this could be a 
Volume Profile strategy, Price Action,  etc.). 
2. When the price gets near that S/R zone, open your Cumulative Delta line chart (it is a 
separate indicator in NinjaTrader 8 platform) . Use it together with  the 1 Minute Price chart.  
3. Wait for a divergence between Price and Cum . Delta  to appear and then enter your trade.  
For a Short trade confirmation, you want to see the price heading upwards  whilst Cumulative 
Delta is heading down. This tells you that , even though the price is heading up, there is more 
activity on  the Bid (possibly Sellers)  and that the price should turn downwards eventually —
to correspond with the dropping Cum ulative  Delta.  
101 
  
For a Long trade confirmation, you want t o see the price heading downwards whil e 
Cumulative Delta is heading up. This tells you that , even though the price is going  down, there 
is more activity on Ask (possibly Buyers) and that the price should turn upwards eventually —
to correspond with the risin g Cum ulative  Delta.  
 
Here are some more examples of Price and Cumulative Delta divergence. If something like 
this appears around  an S/R zone, it is a confirmation to enter your trade.

 Take Profit with  Order F low 
In this chapter , I am going to talk about using Order Flow to determine when and where to 
quit your winning trade . Order Flow is a very useful tool as it allows you to identify a good 
Take Profit , helps you maximize your gain  and assists in trailing your position . It can also warn 
you in advance if there is a n impending  risk that the market could  turn against you.  
 
Volume -Based Take Profit  
Let me start by pointing out the most important message you should remember from this 
chapter: Take your profit in a heavy volume area.  
The reason for this  is that heavy volume areas often work as Support and Resistance zones. 
Whenever the price reaches a Support or Resistance zone, there is a risk that it will react to it 
and turn  in the opposite  direction . This is the reason why yo u should take your profit before 
such risk arises.  
Tip #1: It is safer to take your profit a bit sooner —just a little bit before the heavy volume 
area. This reduces the risk that the market will turn against you at the last moment , causing 
you to miss your Take Profit . This is because,  in my experience, the price sometimes reacts a 
bit before it actually rea ches the heavy volume area.  
Tip #2: If the closest heavy volume area is too close to your trade entry and the risk would not 
be worth it (too small Risk /Reward Ratio) , then you have two options. The first option is not 
to take the trade. The second option is bold er—you take the trade , but you don’t quit it when 
it hits the closest heavy volume area . Instead, you close  it just before it hits the next one.  
I use 30 Minute footprints t o determine which heavy volume zones I should use to close my 
position . This higher time frame allows me to see the  bigger picture , which helps  identify 
heavy volume zones  easier.  
Since  you don’t need Bid x Ask  data , you can use this Take Profit placement strategy for Forex 
trading  as well . 
 
105 
 Here is an example of how  to determine a Take Profit for a Short trade:  
 
 
In the picture above, you can see that the ideal volume -based Take Profit would be at 1.0800. 
This is where heavy volumes were traded before ; therefore , this area could work as a Support. 
When you are in a Short trade, you don’t want to risk that the price will react to such Support. 
The best thing to do is to take your profit  just a bit before the price reaches this level . As you 
can see,  the price reacted to this Support and turned upwards.  If you didn’t close  your Short 
trade  when it reached the heavy volume area , this would have ruined it.

 Take Profit – Trailing  
For those who like to trail their Stop Loss, this section is for you . Being greedy does not usually 
pay o ff in trading, but if you learn this Order Flow technique, it will help you  recogni ze when 
you can afford to  be greedy . 
The main idea behind trailing your Stop Loss using Order Flow is to trail  it only when you see 
aggressive market participants on your side.  
So, to trail your Long position, you want to see aggressive Buyers. Why quit a Long trade when 
aggressive Buyers are pushing the price higher and higher , right?  
The same, only reversed , goes for a Short position: You can trail your Short if there are 
aggressive Sellers actively  pushing the price downward.  
How can you  tell if one side of the market is way more aggressive th an the other? The easiest 
way is to look for Imbalances. When you are Long, you want to see Buying Imbalances. When 
you are Short , you want to see Selling Imbalances.  
If the price continues to move rapidly and it creates  an Imbalance  on the way, then you can 
trail your position some more.  
Imbala nce = Sign of aggressive Buyers/ Sellers . 
*Just to freshen up your memory: If the Bid is 300% or larger  than  the Ask, then it is a Selling 
Imbalance . It is marked in blue and shows on Bid . If the Ask is 300% or larger than the  Bid, 
then it is a Buying Imbalance. This would also be  marked blue and it shows on Ask.

 I like to trail my trades using 5 Minute Bid x Ask footprints:  
 
I also use  this trailing method in a live trading video, which you can find on the webpage I 
made for you ( https://www.trader -dale.com/of -book/ ). 
This particular video is called “ LIVE: Trading JPY Futures  - Trailing Position and Delta 
Divergence .” 
 
Trailing TP - Warning Signals  
When should you stop trailing your position ? It is best to stop trailing your position when you 
see a warning signal that says the market momentum may have change d. What exactly is the 
warning signal? It is essentially  a trading signal that goes against your position.  As an ex ample, 
imagine y ou are in a Long position but one of the Order Flow setups says you should now go  
Short . 
Those signals are : Limit order s, Absorption, Aggressive orders going against you, or a 
divergence between Price and  Delta . Sound s familiar? Yea —those a re the Order Flow setups 
I showed you before. If you spot any of those setups going  against your position, it is high 

111 
 time to quit your trade. This is especially true  if you see any of them appear around a strong  
level of  Support/Resistance or in a heavy v olume zone.

 Stop Loss with Order Flow  
There are three methods of determining your Stop Loss location.  
1. Fixed SL:  This is the simplest way to place your Stop Loss. It is the simplest because 
your SL is always the same (for example , 10 pips). For all your trades , you just use the 
same SL. An advantage of this is that you don’t need to think about each trade and its 
SL separately. A disadvantage is that this method does not adjust to changing market 
conditions. You can alter  this Fixed SL from time to time when the  market conditions 
change dramatically . But still, it is not as flexible and does not reflect the current 
market conditions as well as  the other two approaches . 
2. High/low of the Support/Resistance area:  This means placing your SL at the high/low 
of the S/R resistance area you are trading. I best explain this using the examples below.  
3. Low volume area: This means placing your SL in a low volume area , which is located  
behind a heavy volume area. The reason behind this is that heavy volume area s work 
as zones of  Support/Resistanc e. The price should not go past them . If it does go past  
a heavy volume area, then it is a sign of strong market momentum and there is no 
reason for staying in a trade that would go against that momentum. If a heavy volume 
zone fails to hold the price and it goes past it into the low volume area,  it is time to 
quit your trade. For this approach , I use  the 30 Minute chart with cell content: Volume. 
I don’t need to see Bid x Ask. At this point it is not important whether  the volumes 
were placed at Bid or Ask . What matters here is the total volume . 
My preferred time frame for all these three approaches is the 30 Minute TF. 
Which of the  three approaches to choose  though? I suggest you either stick with the first one 
(Fixed SL) or for each trade you pick one of the two remaining —the second or third depending 
on the market situation (as there will be scenarios where you will be unable to use one of 
them).  
You always should have some rough idea of how wide your SL should  be. With each of these 
approaches I suggest using  your SL somewhere (roughly) within the 10 –20% of average daily 
volatility of the instrument you trade. You can measure the average volatility by ATR indicator 
(a free indicator is available in every trading platform).  
115 
 For example , if the average daily volatility of EUR/USD is 100 pips, then you want your SL 
somewhere (roughly) between 10  and 20 pips. I am not talking just about the first approach 
here (Fixed SL) but also about the other two.  The place which the second or third  approach 
points you to should also be somewhere roughly within the 10–20 pip range. If your SL 
method points  you to a SL that would be outside of this range (either too tight or too wide), 
then it is best to either skip the trade or use a fixed SL somewhere w ithin the 10 –20% range.  
The reason for this is that it would be crazy having too wide an SL (this would lower your RRR 
significantly) or one that is too tight (high risk of SL being hit).   
What you should aim for is having an SL in a place that makes logic al sense and that is also 
within 10 –20% of the daily average range .

 How to Find Supports and Resistances with 
Volume Profile  
 
Volume Profile  Introduction  
Order Flow is a fantastic tool that works great if you use it around strong Support and 
Resistance zones. You can use the Order Flow confirmation strategies to tell whether the price 
is really reacting to the S/R zone or if the S/R zone  is most likely to fail.  
In this section , I would like to show you how to identify such strong Support and Resistance 
zones using my favorite tool —Volume Profile.  
Volume Profile is my favorite tool for identifying strong S/R zones because it can show you 
the bigger picture of what is going on in the chart. This complements the Order Flow, which 
shows more of the granular detail.  
In the next chapters, I am going to teach you the Volume Profile basics and show you my 
favorite Volume Profile setups. Those are setups that you can use to identify strong S/R zones 
from which you can later trade using the Order Flow confirmation setups.  
 
VOLUME PROFILE DEFINITION:  Volume Profile is a trading indicator that shows Volume at 
Price. It helps to identify where the big f inancial institutions put their money and helps to 
reveal their intentions.  
  
121 
 What  Does  Volume Profile Look Like ? 
Volume Profile can have many shapes depending on how the volumes get distributed  
throughout the day . It is created using horizontal lines (it is a histogram). The thicker the 
profile is the more volume was traded at the given level. If a profile is thin in some places , it 
means that there was not much volume  traded there.  
Here is an example of what  Volu me Profile can look  like: 
 
 
How is Volume Profile Different  to Standard  Volume 
Indicators  in MT4?  
Volume Profile shows volume at price. Standard volume indicator s from MT4 (or any other 
software) show  volume during a specific time period.  
That  is a big difference!  

122 
 Volume Profile shows you what price levels are important for the big trading institutions. 
Therefore, it points you to strong Support and Resistance zones.  
Standard volume indicators only show WHEN there were  big volumes traded. This tells you 
nothing about essential  price levels ( Support/ Resistance zones).  
Here is a picture that compares volume at price (Volume Profile) and volume over a specific 
time period (standard volume indicator).  
 
 
What does  Volume Profile Tell Us ? 
Volume Prof ile tells us how the volume was distributed over a given price range. This is very 
useful information. Let me demonstrate with an example . 
 

123 
 You can see two heavy volume zones in the picture below  and one zone where the Volume 
Profile is thin.  
 
What does this particular picture tell us? It tells us that big financial institutions were 
interested in trading in those two heavy volume zones. On the other hand, they did not really 
care for trading too  much in the middle zone where the volume s were  weak . 
This scenario could be a sign that big institutions were:  
1. Building up their huge  selling positions in the heavy volume zone (1.1230 –1.1240).  
2. Manipulating  the price to go into a sell -off (that’s the thi n profile).  
3. And, finally, quitting  their positions (or adding to them) in the heavy volume zone 
around 1.1205 –1.1215.  
  

124 
 Different Volume Profile Shapes  
There are many shapes a Volume Profile histogram can print and many different stories it can 
tell. However, the shapes and the stories behind them tend to repeat themselves , and in the 
end, it comes down to just a few basic shapes the Volume Profile can take:  
 
D-Shaped  Profile  
It corresponds with the letter “D” and this is the most common shape. It tells us that there is 
a temporary balance in the market. Big financial institutions are building up  their trading 
positions and they are getting ready for a big move.  
 

125 
 P-Shaped  Profile  
It corresponds with the letter “P” and this is a sign of an uptrend. Aggressive institutional 
buyers were pushing the price upwards ; then  the price found fair value and a rotation started. 
In this rotation , heavy volumes were  traded , and the market was getting ready for the next 
big move. P -shap ed profiles  are usually seen in an uptrend or at the end of a downtrend.  
 
 
  

126 
 b-Shaped  Profile  
It corresponds with the letter “b” and is the exact opposite of P -shaped profile.  
b-shaped profiles are usually seen in a downtrend or at the end of an uptrend.  
 
 
  

127 
 Thin Profile  
It corresponds with the letter “I” (with little bumps in it).  
A thin profile means a strong trend. There is not much time for building up  trading positions 
in an aggressive price movement. Only small Volume Clusters (sort of “bum ps”) are created 
in this kind of profile.  
One of my favorite trading strategies is based on those Volume Clusters!  
 
 
  

128 
 What Makes  Volume Profile Different  to Other Trading 
Indicators ? 
No other indicator (apart from Order Flow, of course) can show you where the big trading 
institutions were likely buying/selling! Why? Because 99% of all standard indicators are 
calculated only from two variables: Price and Time. Volume Profile gets calculated using three 
variables —Price, Time , and Volume.  
In other words , 99% of standard trading indicators only show you how the price was moving 
in the past. The only difference between those thousands of indicators is how they visualize 
it. It does not matter whether it is EMA , Bollinger bands, RSI, MACD, or any other indicator… 
All those only show a different visualization of a price movement in the past (they are 
delayed —they visualize something that has already happened).  
YES – they are pretty useless , which is the reason traders keep jumping from one to the other  
without having any real success.  
On the other hand, Volume Profile points you to zones that  were and will be important for 
big trading institutions. Simply put – Volume Profile can show you wh at will happen in the 
future!  
 
Why Care  about Volumes  and What  the Big Institutions Are 
Doing ? 
There is a straightforward reason why we need to know what the big financial institutions are 
doing . The reason is that t hey dominate, move , and manipulate the m arkets. It is the y who 
decide where the price will go, not you or I. We are too small.  
Take  a look at following picture . It shows the 10 biggest banks and how much volume they 
control. Together it is almost 65% of the market. Just 10 banks!  
It is those guy s who own this game. Those are the guys we need to track and follow. And how 
do we follow them? By using Volume Profile to track their volumes.  
129 
  
 
Volume Profile – Trading Setups  
In this chapter, I will show you my most favorite Volume Profile setups. You can use these 
setups to identify strong Support and Resistance zones. When the price reaches these zones 
at some point in the future, you can use Order Flow to help you trade there!  
What you will find the most helpful for this will be the Order Flow confir mation strategies. 
These will help you tell if the big market participants are active in those zones and if they are 
going to trade them. If the big guys start joining the party around a strong Volume Profile -
based S/R zone, then it will be a strong confir mation signal for you. Such a signal indicates 
that the S/R is most likely going to work!  
These Volume Profile setups can be used with any time frame. However, this book focuses on 
intraday trading, and for that, I suggest you use these setups with 30 Minu te time frame. You 
can also go to 15 Minute or 1 Hour, but I would not advise going past that.  
  

130 
 Volume Profile Setup #1: Volume Accumulation Setup  
This is my favorite trading setup. It is based on the fact that big trading institutions first need 
to enter their huge trading positions before manipulating the market into a new trend. They 
enter their huge positions in a rotation. This is the only place where they can accumulate such 
large volume without being seen and without their intentions being reco gnised.  
 
You can trade it in three steps:  
1. Look for a price rotation/tight channel that is followed by a strong uptrend (or a 
downtrend). What happens in such a formation is that big institutions are 
accumulating their trading positions (in the rotation ) and then they start the trend. A 
Long scenario look s like this:  
 
2. Use Volume Profile in the rotation area to identify where the heaviest volumes were. 
The area where the heaviest volumes got traded is a strong Support (Long trade 
scenario) . 
3. When the price enters this Support zone in the future, open your Order Flow and wait 
for any of the confirmation setups to appear there . Jump in the trade as soon as it gets 
confirmed on the Order Flow.  

131 
  
 
The Logic Behind Volume  Accumulation Setup  
Let me now expla in the logic behind this setup. There are two reasons (factors) why the price 
reacts to these volume zones so nicely . This reasoning also applies to all the other volume 
setup s I am going to show you  later . 
Reason #1:  Strong Buyers/ Sellers who were accumulating their positions are likely to defend 
their position s. As a result of this,  when the price returns to the volume accumulation area, 
strong Buyers/ Sellers actively defend their positions . 
Strong  Buyers start aggressively buying to drive the pric e upwards again to defend the level 
where  they accumulated their Longs. Strong Sellers  defend their Shorts  positions by 
aggressive selling,  which moves the price lower  again. Here is a picture to demonstrate this 
(a Long trade scenario):  

132 
  
 
Reason #2:  Nobo dy wants to risk a fight with strong and aggressive Buyers/ Sellers.  
Let me demonstrate this by using an  example: First, strong Buyers accumulated their positions 
in a sideways rotation. Then they pushed the price aggressively upwards (this is the Long 
scen ario of Setup #1). After that, the Buyers stopped pushing the price upwards for a while , 
and Sellers took over. They were pushing the price lower and lower, but when they 
approached the strong rotation where the aggressive Buyers had accumulated their mass ive 
positions, the Sellers stopped their selling activity and closed their positions. Why? Because 
they didn’t want to risk a fight with strong and aggressive Buyers.  
When somebody who is in a Short position wants to close  their position, he buys. So , when 
those Sellers start to buy to get rid of their Short  positions, they actually help to drive the 
price upwards.  
 
 
 
 

133 
 Let me make this clear er with a picture:  
 
It is the combination of the se two factors that drives the price away from the 
Support/ Resistance zones.  
  

134

Example #2: Volume Accumulation Setup  
 
 

135 
 Example #3: Volume Accumulation Setup  
 
 
Example #4: Volume A ccumulation Setup  
 
 

136 
 Volume Profile Setup #2: Trend Setup  
This is also one of my favorite Volume Profile setups. It is based on the fact that there is not 
much time for accumulating big trading positions when there is a trend. Sometimes, the trend 
movement halts for a bit and some new and relatively big volumes get accumulated. Those 
volumes show as a little “bump” on the otherwise thin Volume Profile. Those “bumps” are 
called Volume Clusters. Those Volume Clusters often work as strong Support and R esistance 
zones when the price gets back to them in the future. Here are exact steps on how to trade 
this:  
1. Trade this setup when there is a strong trend. If there is an uptrend, you will want to 
trade Longs. If it is a downtrend, then it is Shorts.  
2. When yo u have found a trend (in this case an uptrend), use Volume Profile to see how 
the volume was distributed throughout the trend move.   
 
 
3. Look for significant Volume Clusters that were created within the trend. In th e picture  
below , there is one significant Volume Cluster. The area where  the volumes were the 
heaviest is a Support.  

137 
 4. When the price enters this Support area , open your Order Flow and wait for any of 
the confirmation setups to appear there. You jump in the trade as soon as it gets 
confirmed on the OF.  
 
 
The Logic  behind the Trend Setup : 
The logic behind this setup is that Buyers  were pushing the price upwards  and they were 
adding to their Long positions in the place where we now see the Volume Cluster. When the 
price hits the Volume Cluster again, those Buyers  are likely to become active again and begin 
to defend their Long  position s they placed there e arlier . This  will push the price up from this 
Volume Cluster again.  
The same two factors that help to move the price and which I mentioned with the Volume 
Accumulation setup apply here as well .

 Example #3: Trend Setup  
 
 
Example #4: Trend Setup  
 

140 
 Volume Profile Setup #3: Rejection Setup  
This setup is based on finding a very strong rejection of either higher or lower prices and 
applying Flexible Volume Profile to it  in order to spot strong Volume Clusters.  
The key to trading this setup successfully is in identifying the strong rejection in the chart. 
Sometimes, the strong rejection looks like a strong pin  bar created at a swing point . However,  
sometimes it is not so clear and there is a different  candle pattern. I don't care what pattern 
there is because usually the pattern changes with the time  frame (and I don't like being bound 
by a time  frame). What matters the most is that the rejection is strong and that the 
aggressiveness within it is evident.  
In a Long trade scenario, I look for selling activity followed by a sudden price reversal and 
strong buying activity. For example , like this:  
 
 
 
 
 

141 
 In a Short trade scenario, I look for buying activity followed by sudden p rice reversal and 
strong selling activity. For example , like this:  
 
When there is a strong price reversal, we get the information that one side of the market 
became very aggressive and strongly rejected some price level. When this happens , I am 
interested  in how the volumes were distributed within the rejection. In other words , I am 
interested in the place where the heaviest volumes within the rejection were added to the 
market. The reason for that is that the place with the heaviest volumes mark s the plac e where 
the counterparty was the most aggressive —the place where the biggest fight was.  
 
Here is how to trade this:  
1. Use the Flexible Volume Profile to look into a strong rejection area to see where the 
volumes were the heaviest. There needs to be a nice and strong Volume Cluster there.  
2. The area where the Volume Cluster got formed is a zone of S/R. W ait until the price 
comes back there  again. When it does, open the  Order Flow software to look for a 
trade confirmation.   
3. If there is a rejection of higher prices, then you want to enter a Short position . 

142 
  If there is a rejection of lower prices, then you want to enter a Long position. See the 
example below:  
 
 
The Volu me Profile  Setup #3 is the most difficult setup to trade because sometimes it is hard 
to tell when the rejection was really strong and aggressiv e. Sometimes  the rejection is pretty 
strong but the distribution of volumes within the rejection is not easy to read —mostly when 
there are stronger  volume areas within the rejection  itself . Because of this, it takes some time 
and practice to master this setup

 Where to Get More Info  about Volume Profile  
Volume Profile is a fantastic tool that definitely deserves more of your attention. As this 
book’s main goal i s to teach you Order Flow trading, I won’t go more in depth  with Volume 
Profile. However, you can learn more about it on my website www.trader -dale.com . What 
you will find there is a free copy of my book VOLUME PR OFILE: The Insider’s Guide to Trading  
available for you to download.  
If you would like to go even deeper, I suggest you get my Order Flow Pack  (available here: 
https://www.t rader -dale.com/order -flow -indicator -and-video -course/ ). This pack includes:  
• Order Flow software  
• Volume Profile software  
• Extensive Order Flow and Volume Profile video training  
If you would just like to get the Volume Profile software, you can get it on my website here: 
(https://www.trader -dale.com/volume -profile -forex -trading -course/ ) 
 
Live Trading Examples  - Link  
I first planned to comment on some of my Order Flow + Volume Profile live trades here, but 
the written format makes it quite difficult and not so effective. For this reason, I set up a 
special webpage for you where I uploaded a couple of live trading videos. You can see me 
trading with Order Flow and Volume Profile in those videos using all the tips and approaches 
I showed you in this book. Here is the link:

 What to Do Next  
In this book, I tried my best to explain my trading strategies and give you a good starting point 
for using them independently. I hope you liked it and that you find the way of trading 
alongside the big trading institutions using Order Flow and Volume Prof ile as appealing as I 
do. This book should give you the basics you need to start exploring more and, most 
importantly, get some firsthand  experience.  
Trading using the Order Flow is like driving a car. All the theory about driving is one thing, but 
actuall y driving a car is an experience you won’t be able to learn from a book. You actually 
need to sit in the car and drive. This is what will make you a good driver, not reading books 
about driving.  
The actual process of driving (or trading) will also become w ay more natural when you start 
doing it. I expect that after going through this Order Flow book, your head could feel a bit 
dizzy from the amount of information, especially if Order Flow is entirely new for you. There 
are just so many things to watch, so m any nuances, so many things to remember, right? Well, 
theoretically, yes. BUT when you start using Order Flow in your trading, many of these things 
will become natural for you. In a short amount of time, reading the Order Flow will become 
way easier, and w hen you look at it, you will see a clear picture, not just a sum of cells, 
numbers, and different shades of colors.  
What you need now is to practice the things you have learned. You need practice and hands -
on experience!  
 
Accelerate Your Learning ! 
To accelerate your learning and give you as much information as possible, I have created a 
number of special training courses. There are two  in particular  that I highly recommend 
getting. They are called The Elite Pack and The Order Flow Pack. Each one of them focuses on 
different things. Let me now tell you what those two training packs consist of and how they 
can help you!  
147 
 The Elite Pack  
The Elite Pack is ideal for you if you would like to perfect your trading with Volume Profile. 
This Pack focuses on int raday, swing trading, and long -term investment trading with Price 
Action, Volume Profile, and VWAP.  
It consists of four main parts:  
1. Volume Profile Video Course:  a 15 -hour -long video course on trading with Volume 
Profile, Price Action, and VWAP. It consists  of an in -depth explanation of my favorite 
and proven trading strategies and includes hundreds of real trading examples.  
2. Dale’s Trading Levels: After you have gone through the whole video course, I suggest 
you start following me in my everyday trading. Eac h day I will give you my personal 
intraday and swing trading levels , which are based on the strategies you learned. I 
explain all my trading levels in a daily video, which you will get every day as well. This 
way, you will know what and how I am going to t rade that day and the reasoning 
behind my decisions.  
I think the best way to learn something is to follow somebody who has a lot of 
experience. This is a very effective, proven, and fast way to learn!  
3. Volume Profile + VWAP Indicators : The Elite Pack inclu des a lifetime license to my 
custom -made Volume Profile and VWAP indicators. Those indicators were developed 
by expert developers precisely to my needs. They are fast, precise, reliable, and 
versatile (you can use them for all trading instruments) and they  have all the functions 
you will need for successful trading.  
4. Community & Support:  Apart from all this, you will also get access to my trading 
community and trading forum, where you can discuss your trading with other 
members. It goes without saying that y ou will also get my personal unlimited email

 Just a Few Testimonials  on My Trading Courses  
Excellent Content and Service  
After consuming hours of free content (all great I must add) I decided to buy the VP indicator 
for MT4 and Dale’s online book. A great buy , but I soon realized I wanted to know more about 
Order Flow and all the bits and bobs. Dale had a fresh approach and I was eager to learn more.  
Before I purchased the Elite Pack I asked many questions. Dale and his team answered every 
single one in a time ly manner  and with a personal touch. I felt right at home. From our first 
interaction the support has been unbelievable and the course content incredibly informative. 
I have learnt more in the past month than the last 36. The only thing I regret is not fin ding 
him three  years ago.  
Dale is a straight shooter. Not promising you the Holy Grail of trading and will point out 
successes and failures. It is refreshing!  
 
Great Course, Great Indicators and Damn  Good Value  
There are many trading gurus  to choose from.  The challenge is finding one that is good, honest 
and knows what he is talking about. Trader Dale is one of those. He focuses on volume -based 
trading methods rather than the traditional price and time methods. It is a different and very 
interesting approa ch and one that has great potential for me. I have studied several different 
trading styles and used several different markets. So far, none have worked as expected and 
this is because they were all missing something. That something is volume. Trader Dale clearly 
explains why volume is so important and how to use it. His teaching methods are clear  and 
concise and he explains everything you need to know. His indicators for MT4 and NT8 are top 
class. The price he charges for his training and indicators is ver y reasonable. I have no 
hesitation in recommending him to anyone who  really wants to understand the market better 
and to get the edge that will propel you forwards. This is not a get -rich-quick scheme. There 
is a lot to learn and understand , but Trader Dal e does a fantastic job of explaining everything. 
He gives you the theory and then shows real examples of how it works. He shows winners as 
well as losses and uses different markets to prove that it works. Take the plunge and get the 
professional training a nd support you deserve —you will not regret it.

 Invaluable, very insightful and clear training  
I couldn’t trade without Trader Dale’s Flexible Volume Profile or Order Flow. His explanations 
and training seem to cover every aspect of the volume profile or or der flow and are very clear 
to understand. I was shocked when he explained something in his Order Flow training. For 
years I’ve wanted to understand Order Flow  and I watched hours of video and attended 
countless webinars from individuals claiming they were  going to teach how it works and no 
one ever mentioned one simple point about something that shows up frequently in Order 
Flow  throughout the day. Dale was only one who pointed it out and explained it very clearly 
and, for me, it made Order Flow  immediatel y usable. I’ve never gotten the feeling he was 
holding something back for a future purchase, I do believe he shares all he knows and 
sincerely wants to see others succeed. Very rare.  
 
Reliable and helpful person, professional and excellent  services!  
I found  Dale's wonderful book Volume Profile - The Insider’s Guide to Trading  by chance. Only 
reading the beginning  of his book I knew that was what I was looking for. Then the book led 
me to his website and training courses. He surprised me with  his extreme helpfulness  and 
kindness. Whenever I am confused , he's willing to help with all of his kindness and more than 
I expect. I've never met anyone  who is kin d-hearted and helpful like him. Moreover , not only 
his invented Volume Profile  indicator but his professional trading methods absolutely impress  
me. I do not know what words to say, but I would like to say: Thank God I found him as my 
tutor/ trainer/ advis or in trading. If you are interested in trading and would like to develop 
your trading, please join him and you will never be disappointed.  
 
Quality individual that gives excellent training and market guidance  
I discovered Trader Dale's service a little ov er six months ago and have been absolutely thrilled 
with the knowledge he has shared in that time. Because of the incredible market insights he 
shares with his members, along with the extensive training materials he provides, I have 
become a much improved trader.  
153 
 And the best part is I can now trade with confidence and not with fear. Because of Trader 
Dale's training and market analysis, which  includes expected outcomes at well -defined 
Volume Profile  levels, I can trade with total confidence.  
Yes, there a re losses, but because of the "risk -controlled" training plan he has shared, the 
losses are minimal and rare compared to the successful trades and profits.  
I am so happy I found this service.  
 
Trader Dale —the most honest and reliable Trading School  
Based o n my personal experience with the  link trading market, I found the most reliable, 
honest and simple trading ideas are located under Trader Dale webpages. Really it can be 
considered  a Trading School especially for beginners. It can convert beginners to profitable 
traders  in a short period.  My experience started  early but within three  months studying 
Trader Dale courses – VP, OF & VWAP – I converted my trial from Demo version to profitable 
live trading,  which I  am happy with now. I need to express my thanks to Mr. Dale for his efforts 
and ke en support of his site members. Really I highly recommend beginners to depend on 
Trader Dale ’s website.  
 
Unique Style of Trading with Full Dedication in Teaching  
Dale is a real trader who loves to trade and help people make a decent living out of trading. I 
have been struggling to trade with a number of systems available in the market. I went to 
different gurus even but could not discipline myself and my trading sucked big time.  
After learning from Dale about the Volume Profile, my trading results changed d ramatically 
and I could literally stop over trading and count my profits. Though my progress is slow ’cause 
I already lost a lot of money and my capital is smaller in comparison to other traders , the gem 
I know from Dale now can definitely help me to build  a fortune sooner or later. I believe that.  
Significantly, the daily levels are really helpful for busy people like me , which makes trading 
easier and faster.  
154 
 Thanks , Dale , for your wonderful support. I don’t  usually rate mentors in any review website , 
but if my review counts and supports your program in any way , that is my small gesture of 
showing gratitude for your hard work teaching me how to profit well.  
 
Excellent  
There is not hype with this guy, none. It is very easy to understand, for me I have been trading 
and researching now for about two years and I already used the Volume Profile,  but this guy 
just explained everything about TA and institutions and how they tr ade and the things that 
go on behind the scenes that I assumed were the way he explains them , so this guy has 
basically confirmed every suspicion I have had on how the market really moves and why. A 
lot of people since I have been learning TA go off the de ep end with it, and they literally start 
treating and thinking of the market like it will run all by itself without any people playing and 
it's just one big machine running on its own, or why 90% of all the TA bulls*** out there 
doesn't work and the questi ons I have asked while learning this stuff and why so much didn't 
really fit. Anyways , if anyone is at the point I am with not wanting to work for a firm, but 
deeply desiring  to learn how and why the markets really move, then follow this guy. And the 
plus side is when you fully understand that you literally have to follow big money and stop 
thinking you're going to really do something out there, you'll also be amazed at just how easy 
trading really is. Thanks again , Dale , I have been waiting to find someone  like you for about 
two years now.

 Glossary  
Ask:  Is displayed on the right side of the footprint. It shows how many contracts were traded 
there with Market Buy order and also with Limit Sell order.  
Bid: Is displayed on the left side of the footprint. It shows how many contracts were traded 
there with Market Sell order and also with Limit Buy order.  
 
Cumulative Delta:  Sum of all Deltas of the current day. Its calculation starts every day anew.  
Delta:  A difference between Bid and Ask. It is calculated as: Ask – Bid. Positive Delta indicates 
strong buyers and negative Delta indicates strong sellers.  
 
 
 

156 
 Footprint:  A box that represents a standard price “candle” with the Bid and Ask values 
displayed.  
 
 
High Volume Node (HVN):  A black outline in every footprint pointing to the price where the 
heaviest volumes got traded (within that footprint).  
 
 
Iceberg Order : When a big trading institution enters a position, they sometimes don’t enter 
it all at once with one order. Instead, their algorithms split the order into many small orders. 
For example, instead of entering 10 contracts, they enter 1+1+1… They do th is super quick.  
Imbalance:  If Ask is 300% or more than Bid, then it is a Buying  Imbalance = Buyers are way 
stronger than Sellers. If Bid is 300% or more than Ask, then it is a Selling Imbalance = Sellers 
are way stronger than Buyers. Imbalances are marked in blue. Note that Bid and Ask are 
compared diagonally from left to right!  
 
 

157 
 Multiple Node:  Two or more High Volume Nodes next to each other.  My software highlights 
them in yellow. Multiple Nodes represent Support/Resistance zones.  
 
 
Stacked Imbalance:  Three or more Buying or Selling Imbalances on top of each other.  
 
 
Strong Rejection : Price goes aggressively one way and then suddenly reverse s and goes 
aggressively the other way.  
 
 
Support/Resistance:  A price level or zone in the chart where we expect that the price will 
react to (bounce off ) it. 

158 
 Risk Reward Ratio (RRR):  Potential gain versus the potential loss of a trade. If you use Stop 
Loss = 10 pips and Take Profit = 10 pips, then RRR = 1. If you use SL = 10 pips and TP = 20 pips, 
then RRR = 2.  
Unfinished Business:  A market imperfection. When the market went one way then turned 
the other way without having the high/low formed properly. A properly formed high needs 
to have 0 contracts traded at  the Bid, and a properly formed Low needs to have 0 contracts 
traded at  the Ask.  
 
Volume Accumulation:  An area (usually a price rotation area) where heavy volumes were 
traded.  
 
Volume Cluster:  Area in a chart where heavy volumes were traded. Often appears in a trend 
or in a Rejection.
