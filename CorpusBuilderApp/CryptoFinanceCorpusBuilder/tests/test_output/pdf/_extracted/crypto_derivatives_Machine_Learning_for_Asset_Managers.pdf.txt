Machine Learning for Asset Managers, by Marcos M.
López de Prado, Cambridge University Press (2020). ISBN
9781108792899. Paperback.
Studying machine learning has become a big data problem.
The ﬁeld is characterized by an abundance of techniques, and
for each technique, there are dozens of possible implementa-
tions. The book ‘Machine Learning for Asset Managers’ is a
cost-efﬁcient entry ticket into the ﬁeld.
The author of the book, Marcos López de Prado, is among
the most inﬂuential and highly reputed research-based pro-
fessionals in the ﬁeld of machine learning with ﬁnancial
applications. Given his extensive experience in the industry
and academic research, lots of learning steps have preceded
the writing of this book. The great feature of this book
is that you only have to read 141 pages to get a grasp
of the machine learning techniques that are useful in asset
management.
This book is not a neutral overview book of a research ﬁeld.
It is opiniated, both in terms of selection of topics and writing
style. The writing style is a cocktail of ﬁve important ingre-
dients: (i) a clear narrative to understand the why and how
of the method, (ii) the necessary equations to see the mathe-
matics that are the backbone of the approach, (iii) the Python
code snippets that implement the techniques, (iv) an insightful
application with a discussion of the results and (v) exercises
at the end of each chapter. This combination is excellent and
makes the book useful to understand the theory and prac-
tice of machine learning in asset management. It motivates
the readers to get their hands dirty and use machine learning

Book review
for reaching insights that lead to the discovery of ﬁnancial
theories.
The title of this book sells itself short by aiming only
at asset managers. I recommend reading this book also to
ﬁnancial data scientists and graduate students in empirical
ﬁnance. They will learn the importance of having a theory, the
danger of p-hacking, and how equations translate into code
and how the code leads to results.
The structure of the book is as follows. The book starts
with an equation-free introduction about the role of machine
learning in asset management. The use of machine learning
techniques goes beyond accurate predictions. They are useful
as a source of inspiration to discover the theories that explain
the cause-effect mechanism of the good prediction perfor-
mance achieved. As noted by the author, ‘without a testable
theory that explains your edge, the odds are that you have not
an edge at all’.
Besides the introduction, there are seven chapters that help
the reader to achieve an edge in terms of practical knowledge
to use machine learning techniques in asset management.
Chapter 2 is a technical introduction to speciﬁc types of
shrinkage approaches to covariance estimation. I recommend
reading Chapter 3 ﬁrst. It introduces the reader to different
types of distance measures, that are useful as well to under-
stand the concept of clustering and unsupervised learning
approaches in Chapter 4. Chapters 5 and 6 focus on the pre-
diction problem. Chapter 5 describes the process of ﬁnancial
labelling in which the modeller needs to deﬁne the relevant
transformation of the price data for stock market prediction.
Chapter 6 then discusses different approaches for selecting
the features. Chapter 7 focuses on portfolio optimization.
The bibliography at the end of the book is a great place to
start if you are looking for important scientiﬁc articles in the
ﬁeld.
In Chapters 6 and 8 the caveats of statistical testing are pre-
sented. Chapter 6 presents the use of importance methods as
an alternative to using p-values when selecting the relevant
features. Chapter 8 shows how one can correct for multiple
testing when evaluating a strategy. This is needed since ‘when
a researcher presents an overﬁt backtest as the outcome of a
single trial, the simulated performance is inﬂated’. This then
leads to false discoveries.
The book has the important merit to encourage the reader
to be creative. It describes a careful selection of recipes to
use machine learning to discover new theories useful for asset
management. It does not provide a magic formula to imple-
ment an investment strategy. The discovery of a theory is a
must for the asset manager seeking to develop a proprietary
investment strategy. That is, in the words of Marcos López de
Prado: ‘you cannot bake someone else’s cake and expect to
retain it to yourself’.
