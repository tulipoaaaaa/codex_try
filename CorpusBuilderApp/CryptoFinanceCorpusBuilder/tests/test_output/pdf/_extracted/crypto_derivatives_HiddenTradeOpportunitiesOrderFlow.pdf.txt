 HIDDEN TRADE OPPORTUNITIES  
What I am going to show you is just a part of what I use to trade with 
every day. There are many different styles of trading the futures markets 
and no one style is right or wrong. What I am showing you is how I trade. 
What I have to say may either make total sense to you and be similar to 
how you already trade or I may make no sense to you whatsoever  and 
you will think I am a crackpot. I am not saying my way is the best way for 
you to trade, but it just happens to be what works best for me.  
These trade setups have a very high probability of success.  They occur 
every day and  put up some impressive prof its. I use these set up in all 
major futures markets: ES, YM, ZN, 6E , ZC & ZW.  
A major problem that many traders have is  that they use  so many 
indicators that their screen is to o cluttered that it is difficult to make a 
good trading decision . Sometimes  one indicator says buy and another 
one says sell. I like to keep my screen clean and easy to see.  That is 
why I crea ted the Orderflows.com software.  I wanted an uncluttered 
screen without a lot of squiggly lines to blur my trading decisions.  
All of these setups can easily be seen when they occur in real time with 
the Orderflows.com software which is the only order flow or footprint 
style chart that will highlight the setups.  
Traders often get caught up using complex technical indicators that are 
based on price  to try and predict the market movements. What they  tend 
to forget is that the main driver  of price direction comes down to simple 
supply and demand. If we see demand for a product, service, 
commodity, or currency accelerate, we will begin to see incr easing 
prices for that product. Economists call it “The LAW of demand”, not the 
“theory of demand”, or the “idea of demand”. The Law of demand, like 
the law of gravity is a proven concept.  
I will show you how supply and demand affects price and how to use  
order flow to predict market moves that would otherwise not be noticed 
with traditional charting methods.   
The main focus of this book is to show you how I identify hidden trading 
opportunities that have low risk entr ies. The techniques here are  simple  
and direct so that they can easily be seen w ith order flow charts.

 Order flow charts tell the actual story of what is happening in the market 
as it shows the actual trades by the market participants.  
Although these setups are best suited to short term trading, they  can be 
traded on just about ANY futures market with decent volume and ANY 
intraday time frame or range or volume chart.  I have used them on 
longer term 50 range and 60 minute charts with success. Mostly I use 
the setups  for intraday trading w ith 5 minute charts or 10 range charts.

 The first hidden trade opportunity set up is called the Trapped Traders 
Imbalance . This setup occurs when there is a buying imbalance at the 
top of a bar that closes lower than it opened or when there is a selling 
imbalance at the bottom of a bar that closed higher than it opened.  
Take a look at the candlestick chart on the next page . Can you tell by 
looking at the candlesticks that the market was ready to turn around  
between 10:43 and 10:50am? It is easy to look ba ck at a chart well after 
the fact and say “oh yeah, the market looked like it was ready to turn 
around.” But why would you say that? Is there any ev idence other than 
the bar closed lower  than where it opened? A Japanese candlestick 
trader will say “oh, tha t is a doji pattern which indicates market 
indecision . But it is at a top so it may go down. ” I like candlesticks, I find 
the whole study of candlesticks fascinating, but they as often as they 
work. I don’t need a chart to tell me the market is in an “indecisive 
moment.” As far as I am concerned every moment the market is being 
indecisive.  
 
 
 

Hidden Trade Opportunities              http://www.orderflows.com  Page 4 
 Now look at the order flow footprint chart.  
 
Do you see those 2 big red numbers at the top ? 130 lots trade d at 
1973.50 and 698 lots at 1973.25 . Those are  buying imbalance s greater 
than 400%. These could be people who got into the move at the very 
end. Or these could be people who tried to push the market higher  to 
continue its upward  move. It doesn’t really ma tter what the people were 
thinking that sold that low. Someone has to buy the high . In other words 
these traders are trapped.  What makes this Trapped Buying Imbalance 
even better is there are selling imbalances in the body of the candle.  

Hidden Trade Opportunities              http://www.orderflows.com  Page 5 
  
What is important is that we have an imbalance at a recent high. It 
doesn’t need to be the high of the day;  it can be the high of a swing 
move. You have all these people that bought at the high  and the market 
couldn’t go any higher . This is a Trapped Buyer s Imbalance, for a 
Trapped Sellers Imbalance the opposite would be true.  
So how do we trade this?  
1. You look for buying  imbalance at the top right on a high . 
2. The bar has to close lower  than the open. If there are some selling  
imbalances in the bar, even bet ter, but it is not necessarily needed.  
3. Wait for confirmation of the high by waiting for the bar to close. 
There will be times when it looks like you have a set up and want 
to get in early but the bar hasn’t closed yet and the market 
reverses and the setup is erased and you are in a position you 
shouldn’t be in.  
4. Choose your entry. There are many ways you can enter. You can 
just enter at the market once the next bar has begun. You can try 
and scale in the length of the setup bar, but you run the risk of 
missi ng the trade when it just shoots straight up. The way I trade it 
is I like to get involved no matter what, so I will sell 2 contracts at 

Hidden Trade Opportunities              http://www.orderflows.com  Page 6 
 the market then I will scale the rest in between the low and high of 
the setup bar.  
5. Place your stop. I like to place my stop 2 ticks above  the buying  
imbalance price in the setup bar just to give it some room. This is 
more generous than I really should. You can place your stop at the 
imbalance price or a tick above  it since that would inv alidate the 
set up. Once in while price does go back up to retest the high 
before going lower .  
6. Take profit level. You can be either mechanical or discretionary in 
deciding where to get out. It really depends on the market. For 
example, i n the ES I will pu t in a take profit level 5 points away . In 
Corn and Wheat I like to start at 5 cents away. Once I get into a 
position I monitor it and see if the conditions change. If they do I 
just get out. For example I may get a setup in the opposite 
direction.  
Orderflows software is programmed to draw a green arrow on the 
screen when a Trapped Sellers Imbalance appears  to prompt you to 
go long  and a red Arrow when a Trapped Buyers Imbalance 
appears  to prompt you to go short .

 The second hidden trading opportuni ty is called Single Prints . This set 
up occurs when there is a single print at a high and the bar closed lower 
than it opened or when there is a single print at a low and the bar closed 
higher than it opened.  
A single print is when a single digit (volume n umber) traded at a low of a 
bar that closed higher or when a single digit traded at the high of a bar 
that closed lower.  
The concept behind this trade setup is that the last buyer has bought at 
a high or the last seller has sold at a low. Literally the la st buyer has 
bought or seller has sold. The market has an uncanny ability to turn at 
these levels. There is just no more interest by traders to move the 
market any higher or lower.  
 
Sometimes the ca use of these single prints is a trader wants to try and 
trigger stops at a level. Other times it could be because stops were 
already triggered and the single print is caused by the diminishing trade 
from the stop. Other times traders want to probe the market. Ultimately 
the reason why the single print happened is not so important, what is 
important is where it occurs. I like to see it at a high or low (swing high or 
low is fine) or just following a high or low.  

Hidden Trade Opportunities              http://www.orderflows.com  Page 8 
 So how do we trade this?  
1. You look for  single prints in the bottom left of bar that closed higher 
than they opened or single prints at the top right of bars that closed 
lower than they opened. It is better if the market is at a recent high 
or low as opposed to just range trading.  
2. Wait for the bar to close before entering the market on the next 
bar. A lot of times it may look like a single print top or bottom is 
forming only for the trading in the bar to continue and the single 
print setup to get erased.  
3. Place your stop. I like to place my stop 1 ticks outside of the single 
print. I am strict with the stop placement on this setup because 
once the single print is taken out the setup is invalid.   
4. Take profit level. You can be either mechanical or discretionary in 
deciding where to get out. It really depends on the market. For 
example, in the ES I will put in a  take profit level 5 points away. In 
Corn and Wheat I like to start at 5 cents away. Once I get into a 
position I monitor it and see if the conditions change. If they do I 
just get out. For example I may get a setup in the opposite 
direction.  
In simple ter ms, you would enter the market on the next bar, the bar that 
follows the bar with the single print. Your stop goes just behind the 
single print.  
 
 
Hidden Trade Opportunities              http://www.orderflows.com  Page 9 
  
It doesn’t have to be a print of 1 only, it can be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 or 9. The 
key is it needs to be a single d igit. It is visually obvious.  
The Orderflows software is programmed to draw a red box around 
a single digit on the bottom and a green box around a single digit at 
the top. This will easily highlight to you when a single print occurs.  
  

Hidden Trade Opportunities              http://www.orderflows.com  Page 10 
 The last hidden trad ing opportunity presented in this book is called 
Stacked Imbalance Zones . This setup occurs when there are 3 or more 
stacked imbalances in a bar. A zone  is extended out on the chart to 
highlight this level.  
These are great levels to trade off of when the market retraces into 
them.  
 
 
A stacked imbalance acts as support or resistance because the buying 
or selling was very aggressive. Stacked imbalances zones are tricky 
though as they can occur one right after another. For example, you can 
have a stacked buying imbalance followed by a stacked sell ing 
imbalance where it seems like they are just running into each other and 
make no sense.  But I digress.  
For a stacking buying imbalance, you will buy on a retracement into the 
stacked imbalance zone. For a stack ed selling imbalance, you will sell 
on a retracement into the stacked imbalance zone.  
 

Hidden Trade Opportunities              http://www.orderflows.com  Page 11 
 So how do we trade this?  
1. You look for stacking buying imbalances or stacked selling 
imbalances of 3 or more in a bar.  
2. If it is a stacked selling imbalance the zone bec omes resistance 
and you will look to short when there is a retracement into the 
zone. If it is a stacked buying imbalance the zone becomes 
support and you will look to buy duri ng a retracement into the 
zone.  
3. Place your stop. I like to place my stop 1 ticks  outside of the 
stacked imbalance zone. You can be a little more flexible by 
using a 2 or 3 tick stop if you want especially if you are trading a 
market that has a higher volatility, like ES.  
4. Take profit level. You can be either mechanical or discretionar y 
in deciding where to get out. It really depends on the market. 
For example, in the ES I will put in a take profit level 5 points 
away. In Corn and Wheat I like to start at 5 cents away. Once I 
get into a position I monitor it and see if the conditions ch ange. 
If they do I just get out. For example I may get a setup in the 
opposite direction.  
 
The beautiful part of this setup is you can place a tight stop of 1 tick if 
you wanted to. There are very few setups I have ever known that can 
successfully utilize a one tick stop.  
Orderflows trading software draws a green zone out from where a 
stacked buying imbalance occurred to indicated support and draws 
a red zone out from where a stacked selling imbalance occurred to 
indicated resistance.

 As you will see the re will be some trades that seem so obvious they are 
“slam dunks.” These are the trades with high probability, low risk and 
high reward.  
I like setups that generate signals with winners that are at least twice the 
size of losses and a minimum 50% winning a verage, however, I have 
that 60%+ winning averages are optimum and realistic.  
Once your entry setups have be  defined, don’t fiddle around with them 
trying to make them marginally better. What you should do is focus your 
attention and work on making you exits better.  
You can pick tops and bottoms and have a high success rate if you are 
quick to realize when you a re wrong. You won’t be getting in at the exact 
low, but pretty darn close, usually in the next bar.  
What I like about these Hidden Trading Opportunities is that they provide 
low risk entries to the market because you know exactly where you want 
to get out if the trade breaks down. Not adhering to a defined money 
management stop is the most common cause of failure among traders.  
Great set -ups like these are not something that hap pens once in a while, 
but just about  every day , sometimes several times a day . Some days 
there might be only one or two trading opportunities. Some days there 
might be 5-10. 
As I mentioned in the beginning, order flow trading is not for everyone. 
But I think it is a useful skill and tool for traders to learn and understand.  
The downs ide of order flow trading is that it can be a labo ur intensive 
style of trading. Depending on your time frame you may end up 
spending a good deal of your time paying attention to the order flow as it 
occurs.  
You should try to avoid the marginal trades and  concentrate on the good 
set-ups.  
Each day in the market is different. Some days the market will have 
periods of choppy trading followed by slightly larger trends. On other 
days the market will trade in one direction most of the day. While some 
Hidden Trade Opportunities              http://www.orderflows.com  Page 13 
 days will be more challenging than others, you should still have 
profitable days using these set -ups. 
So there you have it – a simple, easy to understand setup. You are not 
going to get instantly rich from using it. Just use it to give yourself an 
extra trade or two  a day depending on the time frame you are using it 
with. 
A key point to keep in mind is that order flow trading is not an exact 
science. You still need to trade in the direction of the market and be 
flexible.  
At first sight, trading from  order flow charts may seem laborious  or 
tedious . No one ever said profitable trading was glamourous. Over time, 
as you get more comfortable with what to look for in the order flow you 
will find yourself maki ng more high probability trades and making more 
money.  
As a kid I used to watch almost every Chicago Cubs baseball games 
during the summer. What is interesting about baseball is that while all 
the players are “baseball players” each player is a specialist in his 
position. They can all hit and run, but y ou don’t expect a short stop to 
come in and play catcher, or the left fielder to come in and pitch the last 
2 innings for the save. Trading is just like baseball. You have to find the 
position you are most comfortable in and play it. You have to find the 
style of trading you are most comfortable with and become that type of 
trader.  
Successful traders are patient and disciplined. Successful trading begins 
in your mind. Develop patience and disciple  if you want to be successful . 
You might ask me why does pati ence play such an important role in 
trading? In order to answer that question, you should look and compare 
the different ways that institutional traders and retail traders trade. 
Generally speaking, retail have shorter time frames to hold losing 
positions because they tend to be leveraged more than institutional 
traders and just don’t have the financial resources to take too much heat 
when a position goes against them.  
Remember the best traders always trade when they feel they have an 
edge to put the odds in their favour and they trade for one reason only 
Hidden Trade Opportunities              http://www.orderflows.com  Page 14 
 and that is to make money. They don’t trade simply because the market 
is open and they have a need for action. They have discipline.  
Just wait for the right setup whenever it happens and take what the 
market gives you. After all that is the nature of trading – taking what the 
market gives you .  
Before you get too excited: these setups, while impressive, ARE NOT 
the Holy Grail traders are always looking for.  Sometimes they do appear 
as beautiful as they do in the example. Other times they are a little more 
spread out.  The nice thing about order flow set ups is that they have 
their own built in stop loss i.e. your stop loss is basically the high or low 
of the set up bar.
