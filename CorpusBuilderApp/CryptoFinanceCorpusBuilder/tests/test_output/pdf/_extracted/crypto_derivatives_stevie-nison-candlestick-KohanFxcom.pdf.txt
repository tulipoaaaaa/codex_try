Acknowledgements 

Like having ice cream after a tonsillectomy, this section is my treat after 
the book's  completion. 

Some of  those who deserve  recognition for  their  help are addressed 
in  Chapter 1 in  my  discussion  of  my  candlestick education.  There  are 
many others whom I would like to thank for their help along my candle- 
stick path. Candles might help light the way, but without the assistance 
and insights of  many others it would have been almost impossible to do 
this book. There were so many who contributed  in one way or another 
to this project that if  I have forgotten to mention anyone I apologize for 
this oversight. 

The Market Technicians Association (MTA) deserves special mention. 
It  was  at  the  MTAfs library  that  I first  discovered  candlestick  material 
written in English. This material, albeit scant,  was extremely difficult to 
obtain,  but the marvelously complete MTA  library had it.  This informa- 
tion provided  the scaffolding for the rest of  my candlestick endeavors. 

Besides  the  two  English  references  on  candlesticks  I  mention  in 
Chapter 1, I also obtained a wealth of  information from books published 
in Japanese. I would like to thank the following Japanese publishers and 
authors for these books that I used as references:

Then there's  the team at Merrill Lynch who were so helpful in look- 
ing over the manuscript, making suggestions, and providing ideas. John 
Gambino,  one of  the best colleagues anyone can work with provided all 
the Elliott Wave counts in this book.  Chris Stewart,  Manager of  Futures 
Research,  not  only  read  the  entire  manuscript  but  provided  valuable 
suggestions  and  finely  dissected  the  many,  many  charts  I  used.  I  also 
want  to  thank  Jack Kavanagh  in  compliance  who also  read  the  manu- 
script. Yuko Song provided extra insights by conveying some of  my can- 
dlestick questions to her Japanese customers who use candlesticks. 

I have included hundreds of  charts in this book from various services. 
Before I thank all the services that have generously provided use of  their 
candlestick charts,  I want  to  give  plaudits  to  Bloomberg L.P. and  CQG 
(Commodity Quote Graphics). 

Bloomberg L.P. was among the first on-line services to  provide can- 
dlestick  charts on  the  American  markets.  It's  too  bad  I  didn't  discover 
this earlier. I was drawing candlestick charts on my own for years before 
I found out about Bloomberg. CQG, an on-line futures charting service, 
was also among the first to see the potential of  candlestick charts. Within 
a  few  weeks  of my  first candlestick article,  they  sent  me  an alpha  test 
(this is a  high-tech  term for the very early stages of  software prototype 
testing) of  their candlestick software for my CQG System OneT".  Once I 
had  this  software,  my  candlestick  research  progressed  exponentially. 
Most of  the charts in this book are courtesy of  CQG. 

Besides  Bloomberg  L.P.  and  CQG,  other  services  that  were  kind 

enough to provide charts are: 

Commodity Trend Service Charts (North Palm Beach, FL), CompuTracT" 
(New  Orleans,  LA),  Ensign  Software  (Idaho  Falls,  ID),  Future- 
SourceT" (Lombard, Ill), and Quick 10-E Financial Information System 
(New York,  N.Y.). 

I  want  to  thank  those  who  took  time  from  their  busy  schedules  to 
review  the  introductions  for  Part  Two  of  the  book.  These  are:  Dan

Charles  LeBeau  for  the  chapter  on  oscillators;  Gerard  Sanfilippo  and

English language glossary. 

The Nippon Technical Analysts Association (NTAA) deserves utmost 
praise for their assistance. Mr. Kojiiro Watanabe at the Tokyo Investment 
Information  Center  helped  me  to  contact  NTAA  members  who  have 
been especially helpful. They are: Mr. Minoru Eda, Manager, Quantative 
Research,  Kokusai Securities Co.; Mr.  Yasushi  Hayashi,  Senior  Foreign 
Exchange Trader  at  Sumitomo  Life  Insurance;  and  Mr.  Nori  Hayashi, 
Senior  Analyst,  Fidelity Management  and  Research  (Far East).  When  I 
asked  them  questions  via  fax  I  expected  just  brief  answers.  But  these 
three NTAA members took their valuable time to write pages of  explana- 
tions, complete with drawings. They were wonderful about sharing their 
candlestick experiences and insights with me. I also want to thank them 
for reading over and providing information for Chapter 2 on the history 
of  Japanese technical analysis. If  there are any mistakes that remain, they 
are those that I failed  to correct. 

I  want  to  thank  again "idea  a day" Bruce Kamich. Bruce  is a friend 
and  a  fellow  futures technician.  Throughout  our 15-year  friendship  he 
has  provided  me  with  many  valuable ideas  and  suggestions.  Probably 
two of  the  most important were  his suggestion  that I join  the MTA  and 
his  constant  haranguing  until  I  agreed  to  write  a  book  about  candle- 
sticks. 

Then  there's  the  publishing  staff  of 

the  New  York  Institute  of 
Finance.  They  were  all  great,  but  those  with  whom  I  worked  most 
closely deserve extra praise. Susan Barry and Sheck Cho patiently, skill- 
fully and affably guided a neophyte author  through  the labyrinth of  the 
book publishing business. 

Of  course there is my family. At the time that I was writing this book, 
our newborn son Evan entered the picture (with all the excitement about 
candlesticks, I came close to calling him Candlesticks Nison). Try writing a 
book with a newborn and a rambunctious four-year-old daughter, Rebec- 
ca, and you start to get an idea of  how much my wife, Bonnie, contributed 
to this book. She cared for the children while I maladroitly pummeled away 
at the keyboard. Obviously,  she had the harder  job. 

For  each  chapter's  heading,  and  throughout  the  book,  I  used  Japa- 
nese  proverbs or sayings. Many times proverbs in the United States are 
considered trite and are rarely used. This is not so in Japan where prov- 
erbs are  respected.  Besides being enjoyable  to  read,  the Japanese prov- 
erbs offer insights into Japanese beliefs and perspectives. I would like to 

viii  Acknowledgements 

thank the following publishers for the use of  their material for the prov- 
erbs  and  sayings  used  in  this  book:  University  of  Oklahoma  Press, 
Charles E. Tuttle, and Kenkyusha Ltd.

PREFACE 

" A clever hawk  hides his claws" 

W o u l d  you like to learn a technical system refined by centuries of  use, 
but  virtually unknown  here? A  system  so versatile that it  can be fused 
with any Western technical tool? A system as pleasurable  to use as it is 
powerful? If  so,  this book on Japanese candlestick charting techniques is 
for you. You  should find it valuable no matter what your background  in 
technical analysis. 

Japanese candlestick charts  are  older  than  bar  charts  and  point  and 
figure  charts.  Candlesticks are  exciting,  powerful,  and  fun.  Using can- 
dlesticks  will  help  improve  your  market  analysis.  My  focus  will  be 
mainly on  the  U.S.  markets,  but  the  tools and  techniques in  this book 
should be applicable to almost any market. 

Candlestick  techniques  can  be  used  for  speculation  and  hedging. 
They  can  be  used  for  futures,  equities,  options,  or  anywhere  technical 
analysis is applied.  By  reading  this book you  will discover how candle- 
sticks will add another  dimension  of  analysis. 

Do not worry if  you have never seen a candlestick chart. The assump- 
tion of  this book is that they are new to you. Indeed, they are new to the 
vast majority of  the American and European trading and investing com- 
munity. 

If  you are a seasoned technician, you will discover how  joining Japa- 
nese candlesticks with  your  other  technical tools can create a  powerful 
synergy  of  techniques.  The  chapters  on  joining  Japanese  candlestick 
techniques with Western technical tools will be of  strong interest to you. 
If you are an amateur  technician, you  will find how effective candle- 
stick  charts  are as a stand alone charting  method. To  help guide  you,  I 

x 

Preface 

have  included  a  glossary  of  all  the  western  and  Japanese  candlestick 
terms used. 

The Japanese technicals are honed by hundreds of  years of  evolution. 
Yet,  amazingly, we do not know how the Japanese analyze our  markets 
with their traditional technical tool called candlesticks.  This is disconcert- 
ing if  you consider that they are among the biggest players in the finan- 
cial  markets.  The Japanese are big  technical traders.  Knowing how  the 
Japanese use candlestick charts  to  analyze  both  our  markets  and  theirs 
may help you answer the question "What are the Japanese going to do?" 
The  Japanese  use  a  combination  of  western  chart  and  candlestick 
techniques  to analyze  the  markets.  Why  shouldn't  we  do the  same? If 
you  do  not  learn  about  Japanese  candlestick  charts,  your  competition 
will! 

If  you  like  reading  about  colorful  terminology  like  "hanging-man 
lines," "dark-cloud  covers," and  "evening stars" then  this  book  is  for 
you. If  you subscribe to one of  the multitude of  services now providing 
candlestick charts and would like to learn how to use these charts,  then 
this book is for you. 

In the first part of  the book, you learn how to draw and interpret over 
50  candlestick lines  and  formations.  This  will  slowly  and  clearly  lay  a 
solid foundation for the second  part where you will learn to use candle- 
sticks in combination with Western technical techniques. 

This  book  will  not  give  you  market  omniscience.  It  will,  however, 
open new avenues of  analysis and will show how Japanese candlesticks 
can "enlighten" your trading.

"The beginning is  most  important" 

SOME BACKGROUND 

Some  of  you  may  have  already  heard  of  candlecharts.  Probably,  many 
more of  you have not. In December 1989, I wrote an introductory article 
on candlesticks that  precipitated an immediate  groundswell of  interest. 
It  turned  out  that  I  was  one  of  the  few  Americans  familiar  with  this 
centuries-old  Japanese  technique.  I  wrote  follow-up  articles,  gave 
numerous presentations,  taught classes, and was interviewed  on televi- 
sion and by newspapers across the country. In early 1990, I wrote a short 
reference piece for  my Chartered Market Technician thesis about candle- 
stick charts. It contained  very basic introductory material, but it was the 
only  readily  available  information  on  candlestick  charts  in  the  United 
States. This handout became very popular. Within a few months, Merrill 
Lynch, the publisher of  the booklet, received over 10,000  requests. 

HOW I LEARNED ABOUT CANDLESTICK CHARTS 

"Why,"  I  have  often  asked  myself,  "has  a  system  which  has  been 
around so long almost completely unknown in the West?" Were the Jap- 
anese  trying  to  keep  it  secret?  Was  it  the  lack  of  information  in  the 
United  States?  I  don't  know  the  answer,  but  it  has  taken  years  of 
research  to fit  all  the  pieces  together.  I was fortunate  in  several  ways. 

2 

Introduction 

Perhaps my perseverance and serendipity were the unique combination 
needed that others did not have. 

In 1987, I became acquainted with a Japanese broker. One day, while 
I was with her in her office, she was looking at one of  her Japanese stock 
chart  books  (Japanese  chart  books  are  in  candlestick  form).  She 
exclaimed, "look,  a window." I asked  what she was talking about. She 
told me a window was the same as a gap in Western technicals. She went 
on to explain that while Western technicians use the expression "filling 
in  the  gap" the  Japanese would  say  "closing  the  window." She  then 
used  other  expresions  like,  "doji"  and  "dark-cloud  cover."  I  was 
hooked.  I spent  the  next few years  exploring,  researching,  and analyz- 
ing anything I could about candlestick charts. 

It was not easy. There are scant English publications on  the subject. 
My initial education was with the help of  a Japanese broker and through 
drawing and analyzing candlestick charts  on my own. Then,  thanks to 
the Market Technicians Association (MTA) library, I came across a book- 
let published by the Nippon Technical Analysts Association called  Anal- 
ysis  of  Stock  Price  i n   Japan.  It  was  a  Japanese  booklet  which  had  been 
translated  into  English.  Unfortunately,  there  were  just  ten  pages  on 
interpreting candlestick charts.  Nonetheless,  I finally had some English 
candlestick material. 

A few months later, I borrowed a book that has had a major influence 
on  my  professional  life.  The  MTA  office  manager,  Shelley  Lebeck, 
brought a book entitled The Japanese Chart of  Charts by Seiki Shimizu and 
translated  by  Greg  Nicholson (published by  the Tokyo Futures Trading 
Publishing Co.) back from Japan. It  contains  about 70  pages  on candle- 
stick charts and is written in English. Reading it was like finding an oasis 
in a desert. 

As  I  discovered, while  the  book yielded  a  harvest  of  information,  it 
took  some  effort  and  time  to  get  comfortable with  its  concepts.  They 
were all so new. I also had to become comfortable with the Japanese ter- 
minology. The writing style was sometimes obscure.  Part  of  this  might 
have  resulted  from  the  translation.  The  book  was  originally  written  in 
Japanese about 25 years  ago for  a Japanese audience.  I also found  out, 
when I had my  own material translated,  that it is dreadfully difficult to 
translate  such a specialized subject from Japanese to English.  Nonethe- 
less,  I  had  some  written  reference  material.  This  book  became  my 
"Rosetta Stone." 

I carried the book with me for months,  reading and rereading,  taking 
copious  notes,  applying  the  candlestick  methods  to  the  scores  of  my 
hand-drawn candlestick charts.  I chewed and  grinded away at the  new 
ideas and terminology. I was fortunate in another sense. I had the help 

Introduction

of  the author,  Seiki Shimizu,  to  answer  my  many questions.  Although 
Mr.  Shimizu  does  not  speak  English,  the  translator  of  the  book,  Greg 
Nicholson,  graciously acted as  our intermediary  via  fax  messages.  The 
Japanese Chart of  Charts provided the foundation for the rest of  my inves- 
tigation into candlesticks. Without that book,  this book would  not have 
been possible. 

In  order  to  continually  develop  my  abilities in  candlestick charting 
techniques,  I  sought out Japanese candlestick  practitioners who  would 
have the time and inclination to speak with me about the subject. I met 
a Japanese trader, Morihiko Goto who had been using candlestick charts 
and who was willing to  share his valuable  time and insights. This was 
exciting enough! Then he told me that his family had been using candle- 
stick charts for generations! We  spent many hours discussing the history 
and the uses of  candlestick charts.  He was an invaluable storehouse of 
knowledge. 

I  also  had  an  extensive  amount  of  Japanese  candlestick  literature 
translated. Obtaining the original Japanese candlestick information was 
one  problem. Getting it  translated was another.  Based  on one estimate 
there are probably fewer than 400 full-time Japanese-to-English transla- 
tors in America (this includes part-time translators)'  I had to find a trans- 
lator who could  not only translate routine  material,  but also the highly 
specialized  subject  of  technical analysis.  In  this  regard  I  was  lucky  to 
have the help of  Languages Services Unlimited in New York. The direc- 
tor, Richard Solberg, provided indispensable help to this project. He was 
a  rarity.  He was an American fluent in Japanese who  understood,  and 
used,  technical  analysis.  Not  only  did  Richard  do  a  wonderful  job  of 
translating,  but  he  helped  me  hunt down  and obtain Japanese candle- 
stick literature.  Thanks to his help I  might have the largest collection of 
Japanese books on candlesticks in the country. Without Richard this book 
would have been much less extensive. 

Before my introductory  article on candlestick charts appeared in late 
1989,  there  were  few  services offering candlestick charts  in  the  United 
States.  Now a plethora of  services offer  these charts. These include: 

Bloomberg L.P.  (New York,  NY); 
Commodity Trend Service Charts (North Palm Beach, FL); 
CompuTrac '" (New Orleans, LA); 
CQG (Glenwood Springs,  CO); 
Ensign Software (Idaho Falls, ID); 
Futuresource '" (Lombard, IL); and 
Knight Ridder-Commodity Perspective (Chicago, L) .

Introduction 

By  the time you read this book, there probably will be additional services 
providing candlestick charts. Their popularity grows stronger every day. 
The  profusion of  services offering  the candlestick charts attests to both 
their popularity and their usefulness. 

WHY HAVE CANDLESTICK CHARTING TECHNIQUES 
CAPTURED THE  ATTENTION OF TRADERS 
AND INVESTORS AROUND THE  WORLD? 

I  have had calls and faxs from around the world  requesting more infor- 
mation about candlestick techniques.  Why the extensive interest? There 
are many reasons and a few are: 

1.  Candlestick charts are flexible. Users run the spectrum from first-time 
chartists to seasoned  professionals. This is because candlestick charts 
can  be  used  alone  or  in  combination  with  other  technical  analysis 
techniques.  A significant advantage attributed to candlestick charting 
techniques  is  that  these  techniques  can  be  used  in  addition  to,  not 
instead of,  other  technical tools. I am not  trying  to convince veteran 
technicians that this system is superior to whatever else they may be 
using.  That  is  not  my  claim.  My  claim  is  that  candlestick  charting 
techniques provide an extra dimension of  analysis. 

2.  Candlestick charting  techniques  are for  the most  part  unused in  the 
United States. Yet,  this technical approach enjoys a centuries-old tra- 
dition in the Far East, a tradition which has evolved from centuries of 
trial and error. 

3.  Then  there are  the  picturesque  terms  used  to describe  the  patterns. 
Would the expression "hanging-man line" spark your interest? This is 
only one example  of  how Japanese terminology gives candlesticks a 
flavor all their own and, once you get a taste,  you will not be able to 
do without them. 

4.  The  Japanese  probably  know  all  the  Western  methods  of  technical 
analysis, yet we know almost nothing about theirs. Now it is our turn 
to benefit from  their  knowledge.  The Japanese use a combination of 
candlestick charting  techniques  along  with  Western  technical  tools. 
Why shouldn't  we do the same? 

5.  The  primary reason for  the widespread attention aroused  by candle- 
stick charts is that using them instead of,  or in addition to,  bar charts 
is a win-win situation. 

Introduction

As  we will see in Chapter 3  on drawing candlestick lines,  the same 
data is required in order  to draw the candlestick charts as that which is 
needed for our bar charts  (that is,  the open,  high, low,  and close). This 
is very significant since it means that any of  the technical analysis used 
with  bar  charting  (such as  moving  averages,  trendlines,  Elliott  Wave, 
retracements,  and so on) can be employed  with  candlestick charts. But, 
and  this is  the key  point,  candlestick charts  can send  signals  not avail- 
able from bar charts. In addition,  there are some patterns that may allow 
you to get the  jump on those who use traditional Western charting tech- 
niques.  By  employing  candlestick  charting  instead  of  bar  charting  you 
have  the  ability  to  use  all  the  same  analyses  as  you  would  with  bar 
charting.  But candlestick charts provide a unique avenue of  analysis not 
available anywhere else. 

WHAT IS IN THIS BOOK? 

Part I of  the book reveals the basics on constructing,  reading, and inter- 
preting over 50 candlestick chart lines and patterns. Part I1 explains how 
to  meld  candlestick charts  with  Western  technical analysis  techniques. 
This is where the true power of candlecharts is manifested.  This is how 
I use them. 

I have drawn illustrations of  candlestick patterns to assist in the edu- 
cational  process.  These  illustrations  are  representative  examples  only. 
The drawn exhibits should be viewed in the context that they show cer- 
tain  guidelines  and  principles. The actual  patterns do  not  have  to look 
exactly as  they  do in  the  exhibits in  order  to  provide  the reader with a 
valid signal. This is emphasized throughout the book in the many chart 
examples.  You  will see  how variations of  the  patterns  can  still  provide 
'mportant clues about the state of  the markets. 

Thus,  there is some subjectivity in deciding whether a certain candle- 
stick  formation  meets  the  guidelines  for  that  particular  formation,  but 
this subjectivity is  no different than that  used with  other charting tech- 
niques. For instance,  is a $400 support area in gold considered  broken if 
prices go  under $400  intra-day,  or  do  prices have  to  close under  $400? 
Does a $.I0 penetration of  $400 substantiate broken support or is a larger 
penetration  needed?  You  will  have  to  decide  these  answers  based  on 
your trading temperment,  your risk adversity,  and your market philoso- 
phy.  Likewise,  through  text,  illustrations  and  real  examples I  will  pro- 
vide the general principles and guidelines for recognizing the candlestick 
formations. But you should not expect the real-world examples to always 
match their ideal formations.

Introduction 

I  believe  that  the  best  way  to  explain  how  an  indicator  works  is 
through  marketplace  examples.  Consequently,  I  have  included  many 
such  examples.  These  examples  span  the  entire  investment  spectrum 
from  futures,  fixed-income,  equity,  London  metal  markets and  foreign 
exchange markets. Since my background is in the futures markets, most 
of  my charts are from this arena. I also look at the entire time spectrum- 
from intra-day to daily, weekly, and monthly candlestick charts. For this 
book,  when  I  describe  the  candlestick  lines  and  patterns,  I  will  often 
refer to  daily  data.  For instance,  I  may  say  that  in  order  to complete a 
candlestick  pattern  the market has  to  open above the prior day's  high. 
But the same principles will be valid for  all time frames. 

Two  glossaries are  at  the end of  the  text. The  first includes  candle- 
stick  terms  and  the  second  Western  technical  terms  used  in  the  book. 
The candlestick glossary includes a visual glossary of  all the patterns. 

As with any subjective form of  technical analysis, there are, at times, 
variable definitions which will be defined according to the users'  experi- 
ence and background. This is true of  some candlestick patterns. Depend- 
ing on my source of  information,  these were instances in which I  came 
across different,  albeit  usually  minor,  definitions of  what  constitutes  a 
certain pattern.  For  example, one Japanese author  writes  that  the open 
has to be above  the prior close in  order  to complete a dark-cloud cover 
pattern (see Chapter 4). Other written and oral sources say that, for this 
pattern,  the open should be above the prior high. 

In cases where there were different definitions, I chose the rules that 
increased the probability that the pattern's  forecast would be correct. For 
example,  the pattern referred to in the prior paragraph is a reversal sig- 
nal that appears at tops. Thus, I chose the definition that the market has 
to open above the prior day's high. It is more bearish if  the market opens 
above the prior day's  high and then fails,  then it would be if  the market 
just opens above the prior day's  close and then failed. 

Much of  the Japanese material I  had  translated  is  less than specific. 
Part of  this might be the result of  the Japanese penchant for being vague. 
The penchant may have its origins in the feudal ages when it was accept- 
able  for  a  samurai  to  behead  any  commoner  who  did  not  treat  him  as 
expected. The commoner did not always know how a samurai expected 
him  to  act  or  to  answer.  By  being  vague,  many  heads  were  spared. 
However, I think the more important reason for the somewhat ambigtl- 
ous explanations has to  do with  the fact  that  technical analysis is more 
of  an  art  than  a  science.  You  should  not  expect  rigid  rules  with  most 
forms of  technical analysis-just guideposts. 

Yet,  because of  this uncertainty,  some of  the ideas in  this book may 
be  swayed  by  the  author's  trading  philosophy.  For  instance,  if  a Japa- 
nese author says that a candlestick line has to be "surpassed  to signal 

Introduction 

7 

the next bull move, I equate "surpassed" with "on a close above." That 
is  because,  to  me,  a  close  is  more  important  than  an  intra-day  move 
above  a  candlestick line.  Another  example of  subjectivity: In  the  Japa- 
nese literature many candlestick patterns are described as important at a 
high-price  area  or  at  a  low-price  area.  Obviously  what  constitutes  a 
"high-price" or "low-price" area is open to interpretation. 

SOME LIMITATIONS 

As  with  all  charting  methods,  candlestick chart  patterns are  subject  to 
the  interpretation  of  the  user.  This  could  be  viewed  as  a  limitation. 
Extended experience with candlestick charting in your  market  specialty 
will  show  you  which  of  the  patterns,  and  variations  of  these  patterns, 
work best. In this sense, subjectivity may not be a liability. As you gain 
experience in candlestick techniques, you will discover which candlestick 
combinations work best in your market. This may give you an advantage 
over those who have not devoted  the time and energy  in tracking your 
markets as closely as you have. 

As  discussed  later  in  the  text,  drawing  the  individual  candlestick 
chart lines requires a close. Therefore, you may have to wait for the close 
to get a valid trading signal. This may mean a market on close order may 
be needed  or you  may have to try and anticipate what the close will be 
and place an order a few minutes prior to the close. You  may also prefer 
to wait for the next day's  opening before placing an order. 

This aspect  may be a problem but there are many  technical systems 
(especially those  based  on  moving  averages  of  closing  prices)  which 
require a closing price for a signal. This is why there is often a surge in 
activity  during the final few  minutes of  a  trading session  as computer- 
ized  trading signals,  based on closing prices, kick into play. Some tech- 
nicians consider only a close above resistance a valid buy signal so they 
have to wait until the close for confirmation. This aspect of  waiting for a 
close is not unique to candlestick charts. 

On occasion,  I  can  use  the  hourly  candlestick charts  to  get  a  trade 
signal rather  than waiting for  the close of  that day.  For  instance,  there 
could be a potentially bullish candlestick pattern on the daily chart. Yet, 
I would have to wait for the close before the candlestick pattern is com- 
pleted. If the hourly charts also show a bullish candlestick indicator dur- 
ing  that  day,  I  may  recommend  buying  (if  the  prevalent  trend  is  up) 
even before the close. 

The  opening  price is  also  i.mportant in  the  candlestick lines.  Equity 
traders,  who do not have access to on-line quote machines,  may not be 

8 

Introduction 

able to get opening prices on stocks in their newspapers. I hope that, as 
candlestick charts become more common, more newspapers will include 
openings on individual stocks. 

Candlestick charts provide many useful trading signals. They do not, 
however,  provide price targets. There are other methods to forecast tar- 
gets  (such  as  prior  support  or  resistance  levels,  retracements,  swing 
objectives,  and  so on). Some  Japanese candlestick practitioners  place  a 
trade based on a candlestick signal. and stay with that trade until another 
candlestick  pattern  tells  them  to  offset.  Candlestick  patterns  should 
always be viewed in the context as to what occurred before and in  rela- 
tion to other technical evidence. 

With  the  hundreds  of  charts  throughout  this  book,  do  not  be  sur- 
prised  if  you  see  patterns  that  I have  missed  within  charts.  There  will 
also be examples of  patterns  that,  at  times,  did  not  work. Candlesticks 
will  not  provide  an  infallible  trading  tool.  They  do,  however,  add  a 
vibrant color to your technical palette. 

Candlestick charts  allow  you  to  use  the same  technical devices  that 
you use with  bar charts.  But  the candlestick charts give you signals not 
available  with  bar  charts.  So  why  use  a  bar  chart? In  the  near  future, 
candlestick charts may become as standard as the bar chart. In fact, I am 
going  to  make  a  bold  prediction:  A s   more  technicians  become  comfortable 
with candlestick  charts,  they will  no longer use bar charts. I have been a tech- 
nical  analyst  for  nearly  20  years.  And  now,  after  discovering  all  their 
benefits, I only use candlestick charts. I still use all the traditional West- 
ern technical tools, but the candlesticks have given me a unique perspec- 
tive into the markets. 

Before I delve into the topic of  candlestick charts, I will briefly discuss 
the importance of  technical analysis as a separate discipline. For those of 
you who are new to this topic,  the following section is meant to empha- 
size why technical analysis is so important.  It is not an in-depth discus- 
sion. If  you would like to learn more about the topic, I suggest you read 
John Murphy's  excellent  book  Technical  Analysis  of  the  Futures  Markets 
(The New York  Institute  of  Finance). 

If  you are already familiar with the benefits of  technical analysis, you 
can skip this section. Do not worry, if  you do not read the following sec- 
tion, it will not interfere with later candlestick chart analysis information. 

THE  IMPORTANCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 

The  importance  of  technical  analysis  is  five-fold.  First,  while  funda- 
mental analysis may  provide  a  gauge  of  the  supplyidemand  situations, 

Introduction 

9 

pricelearnings ratios,  economic statistics, and  so forth,  there is  no  psy- 
chological  component  involved  in  such  analysis.  Yet  the  markets  are 
influenced  at  times,  to  a  major  extent,  by  emotionalism.  An  ounce  of 
emotion can be worth a pound of facts. As John Manyard Keynes stated, 
"there is nothing so disastrous as a rational investment policy in an irra- 
tional ~ o r l d . " ~  Technical analysis provides the only  mechanism  to mea- 
sure the "irrational" (emotional) component present in all markets. 

Here  is  an  entertaining  story  about  how  strongly  psychology  can 
It takes place at the 

affect a market. It is from the book The New G a t ~ b y s . ~  
Chicago Board  of  Trade. 

Soybeans were  sharply higher.  There was a drought in  the Illinois Soy- 
bean Belt. And unless it ended soon, there would be a severe shortage of 
beans. .  .  . Suddenly a few drops of  water slid down a window. "Look," 
someone  shouted,  "rain!".  More  than  500  pairs  of  eyes  [the  traders- 
editor's  note] shifted to the big windows. . . . Then came a steady trickle 
which turned into a steady downpour. It was raining in downtown Chi- 
cago. 

Sell.  Buy.  Buy.  Sell.  The  shouts cascaded from  the  traders'  lips  with  a 
roar that matched  the thunder outside. And the price of  soybeans began 
to slowly move down. Then the price of  soybeans broke like some tropic 
fever. 

It  was  pouring in  Chicago all  right,  but no one grows  soybeans  in  Chi- 
cago. In the heart of  the Soybean Belt,  some 300 miles south of  Chicago 
the sky was  blue,  sunny and very  dry. But  even if  it  wasn't  raining  on 
the soybean fields it was in the heads of  the traders, and  that is all  that counts 
[emphasis  added].  To  the  market  nothing  matters  unless  the  market 
reacts  to  it.  The  game  is  played  with  the  mind  and  the  emotions  [emphasis 
added]. 

In order  to drive  home the point about the importance  of  mass psy- 
chology, think about what happens when you exchange a piece of  paper 
called "money" for some item like food or  clothing? Why is that paper, 
with no intrinsic value,  exchanged for something tangible? It is because 
of  a  shared  psychology.  Everyone  believes it  will  be  accepted,  so it  is. 
Once this shared  psychology evaporates,  when people stop believing in 
money,  it becomes worthless. 

Second,  technicals  are  also  an  important  component  of  disciplined 
trading.  Discipline  helps  mitigate  the  nemesis  of  all  traders,  namely, 
emotion. As soon as you have money in the market, emotionalism is in 
the  driver's  seat and  rationale and  objectivity are merely passengers.  If 
you  doubt  this,  try  paper  trading.  Then  try  trading  with  your  own 
funds. You will soon discover how deeply the counterproductive aspects 
of  tension,  anticipation,  and  anxiety  alter  the  way  you  trade and  view 

10 

Introduction 

the  markets-usually  in  proportion  to the  funds  committed.  Technicals 
can put objectivity back into the drivers seat. They provide a mechanism 
to set entry and exit  points,  to set riskheward  ratios, or  stoplout levels. 
By  using  them,  you foster  a  risk  and  money  management approach  to 
trading. 

As  touched  upon in  the  previous  discussion,  the  technicals contrib- 
ute to  market  objectivity. It is  human nature,  unfortunately,  to see  the 
market as we want  to see it,  not as it really is.  How often does the fol- 
lowing occur? A trader buys. Immediately the market falls. Does he take 
a loss. Usually no. Although there is no room for hope in the market, the 
trader  will  glean all  the fundamentally bullish news he can  in  order  to 
buoy  his  hope  that  the  market  will  turn  in  his  direction.  Meanwhile 
prices  continue  to  descend.  Perhaps  the  market  is  trying  to  tell  him 
something.  The  markets  communicate  with  us.  We  can  monitor  these 
messages by using the technicals. This trader is closing his eyes and ears 
to the messages being sent by the market. 

If  this  trader  stepped  back  and  objectively viewed  price  activity,  he 
might get a better feel of  the market. What if  a supposedly bullish story 
is  released  and  prices  do not  move  up or  even  fall? That  type  of  price 
action is sending out volumes of  information about the psychology of  the 
market and how one should trade in it. 

I believe it was the famous trader Jesse Livermore who expressed  the 
idea that one can see the whole better when one sees it from a distance. 
Technicals make  us  step  back  and  get  a  different  and,  perhaps,  better 
perspective on the market. 

Third,  following the technicals is important  even if  you do not fully 
believe in their use. This is because, at times, the technicals are the majon 
reason for a market move. Since  they are a market  moving factor,  they 
should be watched. 

Fourth,  random walk  proffers that the market  price for  one day has 
no bearing on the price the following day. But this academic view leaves 
out an important component-people. People remember prices from one 
day  to  the  next  and  act  accordingly. To  wit,  peoples'  reactions  indeed 
affect  price,  but price also affects peoples'  reactions. Thus,  price,  itself, 
is  an  important  component  in  market  analysis.  Those  who  disparage 
technical analysis forget this last point. 

Fifth, and finally, the price action is the most direct and easily acces- 
sible method of  seeing overall supplyldemand  relationships.  There may 
be  fu.ndamenta1 news  not  known  to  the  general  public  but  you  can 
expect it is already in the price. Those who have advance knowledge of 
some  market  moving  event  will  most  likely  buy  or  sell  until  current 
prices reflect their information. This knowlehge, at times, consequently, 

may be discounted  when the event occurs. Thus,  current  prices should 
reflect all available information, whether known by the general public or 
by a select few.

CHAPTER  2 

A HISTORICAL 
BACKGROUND 

"Through Inquiring of  the Old  We Learn the New" 

T h i s  chapter provides the framework through which Japanese technical 
analysis evolved. For those who are in a rush to get to the "meat" of  the 
book (that is, the techniques and uses of  candlesticks), you can skip this 
chapter,  or return to it after you have completed the rest of  the book. It 
is an intriguing history. 

Among  the  first  and  the  most  famous  people  in  Japan to  use  past 
prices  to  predict future  price  movements  was  the legendary  Munehisa 
Homma.'  He amassed  a huge fortune  trading in the rice market during 
the 1700s. Before I discuss Homma, I want to provide an overview of  the 
economic background  in  which Homma  was able  to flourish.  The  time 
span of  this overview is from the late 1500s to the mid-1700s. During this 
era Japan went from 60  provinces to a unified country where commerce 
blossomed. 

From 1500 to 1600, Japan was a country incessantly at war as each of 
the  daimyo  (literally "big  name" meaning  "a  feudal  lord")  sought  to 
wrestle  control  of  neighboring  territories.  This  100-year span  between 
1500  and  1600  is  referred  to  as  "Sengoku  Jidai" or,  literally,  "Age  of 
Country  at  War." It  was  a  time  of  disorder.  By  the  early  1600s,  three 
extraordinary  generals-Nobunaga  Oda,  Hideyoshi  Toyotomi,  and 
Ieyasu Tokugawa-had  unified Japan over a 40-year period. Their prow- 
ess  and  achievements  are  celebrated  in  Japanese history  and  folklore. 

14 

A Historical  Background 

There  is  a  Japanese  saying:  "Nobunaga  piled  the  rice,  Hideyoshi 
kneaded  the  dough,  and  Tokugawa  ate  the  cake." In  other  words,  all 
three generals contributed to Japan's unification but Tokugawa,  the last 
of  these  great  generals,  became  the  shogun  whose  family  ruled  Japan 
from 1615 to 1867. This era is referred to as the Tokugawa Shogunate. 

The  military conditions that suffused  Japan for  centuries became an 
integral part of  candlestick terminology. And, if  you think about it,  trad- 
ing requires many of  the same skills needed  to win a battle. Such skills 
include  strategy,  psychology,  competition,  strategic  withdrawals,  and 
yes, even luck. So it is not surprising that throughout this book you will 
come  across  candlestick  terms  that  are  based  on  battlefield  analogies. 
There  are "night  and  morning.attacks",  the "advancing three  soldiers 
pattern", "counter attack lines",  the "gravestone", and so on. 

The  relative stability engendered  by  the centralized Japanese feudal 
system lead by Tokugawa offered new opportunities. The agrarian econ- 
omy  grew,  but,  more  importantly,  there  was  expansion  and  ease  in 
domestic trade.  By  the 17th  century,  a  national  market  had  evolved  to 
replace  the system of  local and isolated markets. This concept of  a cen- 
tralized marketplace was to indirectly lead to the development of  techni- 
cal analysis in Japan. 

Hideyoshi  Toyotomi regarded  Osaka as  Japan's  capital  and  encour- 
aged its growth as a commercial center.  Osaka's  easy access  to the sea, 
at a time where land  travel was slow, dangerous, and costly,  made it a 
national  depot  for  assembling and  disbursing  supplies.  It  evolved  into 
Japan's greatest city of  commerce and finance. Its wealth and vast store- 
houses of  supplies provided Osaka with the appellation the "Kitchen of 
Japan." Osaka  contributed  much  to  price  stability  by  smoothing  out 
regional  differences  in  supply.  In  Osaka,  life  was  permeated  by  the 
desire for profit (as opposed to other cities in which money making was 
despised). The social system at that time was composed of  four classes. 
In descending order they were the Soldier, the Farmer, the Artisan, and 
the Merchant.  It  took  until  the  1701)s for  merchants  to  break  down  the 
social barrier. Even  today  the  traditional greeting in Osaka is  "Mokari- 
makka" which means, "are you making a profit?". 

In Osaka, Yodoya  Keian became a war merchant for  Hideyoshi (one 
of  the three great military unifiers). Yodoya had extraordinary abilities in 
transporting,  distributing,  and  setting  the  price  of  rice.  Yodoyals front 
yard  became so important  that  the first  rice exchange developed  there. 
He  became  very  wealthy-as  it  turned  out,  too  wealthy.  In  1705,  the 
Bakufu  (the  military  government  led  by  the  Shogun)  confiscated  his 
entire fortune on the charge that he was living in luxury not befitting his 

A Historical  Background 

15 

social rank.  The Bakufu was apprehensive  about  the increasing amount 
of  power  acquired  by  certain  merchants.  In 1642,  certain  officials  and 
merchants  tried  to corner the rice market. The punishment was severe: 
their  children  were  executed,  the  merchants  were  exiled,  and  their 
wealth was confiscated. 

The rice market that originally developed in Yodoya's  yard was insti- 
tutionalized when the Dojima Rice Exchange was set up in the late 1600s 
in Osaka. The merchants at the Exchange graded  the rice and bargained 
to  set  its  price.  Up  until 1710,  the  Exchange  dealt  in  actual  rice.  After 
1710,  the  Rice  Exchange  began  to  issue  and  accept  rice  warehouse 
receipts.  These  warehouse  receipts were  called  rice coupons.  These  rice 
receipts became the first futures contracts ever traded. 

Rice  brokerage became  the foundation  of  Osaka's  prosperity. There 
were more than 1,300 rice dealers. Since there was no currency standard 
(the  prior  attempts  at  hard  currency failed  due  to  the  debasing  of  the 
coins), rice became the defacto medium of  exchange. A daimyo needing 
money would  send  his surplus rice  to Osaka where it would be  placed 
in a  warehouse in  his  name.  He  would  be  given a coupon as a  receipt 
for  this rice. He could sell this rice coupon whenever he pleased.  Given 
the financial problems of  many daimyos, they would also often sell rice 
coupons  against  their  next  rice  tax  delivery (taxes to  the  daimyo  were 
paid in  rice-usually 40% to 60% of  the rice farmer's  crop). Sometimes 
the rice crop of  several years hence was mortgaged. 

These  rice  coupons  were  actively  traded.  The  rice  coupons  sold 
against future  rice  deliveries became  the world's  first futures contracts. 
The  Dojima  Rice  Exchange,  where  these  coupons  traded,  became  the 
world's  first  futures  exchange.  Rice  coupons  were  also  called  "empty 
rice" coupons  (that is,  rice that was not in physical possession). To  give 
you  an  idea  of  the  popularity  of  rice  futures  trading,  consider  this:  In 
1749,  there  were a  total of  110,000  bales  (rice used  to  trade in  bales) of 
empty-rice coupons traded in Osaka. Yet,  throughout  all of  Japan there 
were only 30, 000  bales of  ricea2 

Into  this  background  steps  Homma,  called  "god  of  the  markets." 
"Munehisa Homma was born in 1724 into a wealthy family. The Homma 
family was considered  so  wealthy that  there was a saying at that  time, 
"I  will  never  become a Homma,  but I  would  settle  to  be  a local lord." 
When Homma was given control of  his family business in 1750, he began 
trading at his local rice exchange in the port city of  Sakata. Sakata was a 
collections  and  distribution  area  for  rice.  Since  Homma  came  from 
Sakata, you will frequently come across the expression "Sakata's Rules" 
in Japanese candlestick literature. These refer to Homma. 

16 

A Historical  Background 

When  Munehisa  Homma's  father  died,  Munehisa  was  placed  in 
charge of managing the family's  assets. This was in spite of  the fact that 
he was  the youngest son.  (It was  usually the eldest  son  who inherited 
the  power  during  that  era.) This  was  probably because of  Munehisa's 
market  savvy.  With  this  money,  Homma  went  to  Japan's  largest  rice 
exchange,  the  Dojima  Rice  Exchange in  Osaka,  and  began  trading  rice 
futures. 

Homma's family had a huge rice farming estate. Their power meant 
that information about the rice market was usually available to them. In 
addition,  Homma kept records of  yearly weather conditions. In order to 
learn  about  the  psychology  of  investors,  Homma  analyzed  rice  prices 
going back  to  the  time when  the  rice  exchange was  in  Yodoya's  yard. 
Homma  also  set  up  his  own  communications system.  At  prearranged 
times  he  placed  men  on  rooftops  to  send  signals by  flags.  These  men 
stretched  the distance from Osaka to. Sakata. 

After  dominating  the  Osaka  markets,  Homma  went  to  trade  in  the 
regional exchange  at  Edo  (now called  Tokyo). He  used  his  insights  to 
amass  a  huge  fortune.  It  was  said  he  had  100  consecutive  winning 
trades. 

His  prestige  was  such  that  there  was  the  following folk  song  from 
Edo:  "When  it  is  sunny  in  Sakata  (Homma's  town),  it  is  cloudy  in 
Dojima  (the Dojima Rice Exchange in Osaka) and rainy at Kuramae (the 
Kuramae exchange in Edo)." In other words when  there is  a good  rice 
crop in Sakata, rice prices fall on the Dojima Rice Exchange and collapse 
in Edo. This song reflects the Homma's  sway over the rice market. 

In later  years Homma  became a  financial consultant  to  the  govern- 
ment  and  was  given  the  honored  title  of  samurai.  He  died  in  1803. 
Homma's  books about  the markets  (Sakata Senho  and Soba  Sani No  Den) 
were  said  to  have been  written in  the 1700s.  His  trading  principles,  as 
applied  to  the  rice  markets,  evolved  into  the  candlestick  methodology 
currently used in Japan.

A comparison between  the visual differences of  a bar chart and a can- 
dlestick chart is easy to illustrate. Exhibit 3.1 is the familiar Western bar 
chart. Exhibit 3.2 is a candlestick chart of  the same price information as 
that in  the bar  chart.  On the candlestick chart,  prices seem  to  jump off 
the page  presenting a stereoscopic view  of  the market as it  pushes the 
flat,  two-dimensional  bar  chart  into  three  dimensions.  In  this  respect, 
candlecharts are visually exciting. 

DRAWING THE  CANDLESTICK LINES 

Since candlestick charts are new  to most Western technicians, the most 
common Western chart, the bar chart, is used throughout this chapter as 
an instructional tool for learning how to draw the candlestick lines. 

Drawing the daily bar chart line requires open,  high, low, and close. 
The vertical line on a bar chart depicts the high and low of  the session. 
The horizontal line to the left of  the vertical line is the opening price. The 
horizontal line to the right of  the vertical line is the close. 

Exhibit  3.3 shows  how  the same data  would  be  used  to construct  a 
bar chart and a candlestick chart. Although the daily bar chart lines and 
candlestick chart lines use  the same data,  it is easy to see  that  they are 
drawn differently. The thick part of  the candlestick line is called the real

body. It represents the range between that session's  opening and closing. 
When the real body is black  (i.e., filled in) it means the close of  the ses- 
sion was lower than the open. If  the real body is white  (i.e., empty), it 
means the close was higher than the open. 

The thin lines above and below the real body are the shadows. These 
shadows represent  the session's  price extremes. The shadow above the 
real body is called the upper shadow and the shadow under the real body 
is known as the lower shadow. Accordingly, the peak of  the upper shadow 
is the high of  the session and the bottom of  the lower shadow is the low 
of  the session. It is easy to see why these are named candlestick charts 
since  the  individual lines  often  look  like  candles and  their  wicks.  If  a 
candlestick line has no upper shadow it is said to have a shaven head. A 
candlestick line with no lower shadow has a shaven bottom. To  the Japa- 
nese,  the  real body  is  the  essential  price  movement. The  shadows  are 
usually considered as extraneous price fluctuations. 

Exhibits 3.4 through 3.7 demonstrate some common candlestick lines. 
Exhibit 3.4 reveals a long black candlestick reflecting a bearish period in 
which  the market opened  near its high and closed near its low.  Exhibit 
3.5 shows the opposite of  a long black body and, thus, represents a bull- 
ish period. Prices had a wide range and the market opened near the low 
and  closed near the  high of  the session. Exhibit 3.6 shows candlesticks 
having  small  real  bodies  and,  as  such,  they  represent  a  tug  of  war 
between the  bulls and  the  bears. They  are  called  spinning  tops  and  are 
neutral in lateral trading bands. As shown later in this book (in the  sec-

tions  on  stars  and  harami  patterns),  these  spinning  tops  do  become 
important  when  part  of  certain  formations.  The  spinning  top  can  be 
either white or black. The lines illustrated in Exhibit 3.6 have small upper 
and lower shadows, but the size of  the shadows are not important. It is 
the  diminutive  size  of  the  real  body  that  makes  this  a  spinning  top. 
Exhibit  3.7 reveals  no  real  bodies.  Instead,  they  have  horizontal  lines. 
These are examples of  what are termed doji lines. 

A doji occurs when the open and close for that session are the same 
or  very  close  to  being  the  same  (e.g.,  two-  or  three-thirty-seconds  in 
bonds,  a Yi cent in grains,  and so on.). The lengths of  the shadows can 
vary. Doji are so important that an entire chapter is devoted to them (see 
Chapter 8 The  Magic  Doji). 

Candlestick charts  can  also  be  drawn  more  colorfully  by  using  the 
classical Japanese candlestick chart  colors of  red  and black.  Red  can  be 
used instead of  the white candlestick. (This could be especially useful for 
computer displays of  the candlestick charts.) The obvious problem with 
this color scheme is that photo copies and most computer printouts will 
not be useful since all the real bodies would come out as black. 

Some  readers  may  have  heard  the  expression  yin  and  yang  lines. 
These  are  the  Chinese  terms  for  the  candlestick lines.  The  yin  line  is 
another name for the black candlestick and the yang line is equivalent to 
the white candlestick. In Japan, a black candlestick is called in-sen  (black 
line) and the white candlestick is called yo-sen  (white line). 

The Japanese place great  emphasis  on the  relationship  between  the 
open  and  close  because  they  are  the  two  most  emotionally  charged 

Constructing the Candlesticks

points  of  the trading day. The Japanese have a  proverb  that says, "the 
first hour of  the morning is the rudder of  the day." So is the opening the 
rudder for the trading session. It furnishes the first clue about that day's 
direction. It is a time when all the news and rumors from overnight are 
filtered and then  joined into one point in time. 

The more anxious the trader,  the earlier he wants to trade. Therefore, 
on  the  open,  shorts  may  be  scrambling for cover,  potential  longs  may 
want to emphatically buy,  hedgers may need to take a new or get out of 
an old position, and so forth. 

After  the  flurry of  activity on  the  open,  potential  buyers and sellers 
have a benchmark from which they can expect buying and selling. There 
are frequent analogies to trading the market and fighting a battle. In this 
sense,  the  open  provides  an  early  view  of  the  battlefield and  a  provi- 
sional indication of  friendly and opposing troops. At times, large traders 
may try to move the market on the open by executing a large buy or sell 
order. Japanese call this a morning attack.  Notice that this is another mil- 
itary analogy. The Japanese use many such military comparisons  as we 
shall see throughout the book. 

CANDLESTICK TERMINOLOGY AND MARKET EMOTION 

Technicals are  the only  way  to  measure  the emotional  component  of  the  : 
market.  The names  of  the Japanese candlestick charts  make  this fact  evi-  : 
dent.  These  names  are  a  colorful  mechanism  used  to  describe  the  emo-  i 
tional  health  of  the  market  at  the  time  these  patterns  are  formed.  After  : 
hearing the expressions "hanging man" or "dark-cloud cover," would you  i 
think the market is in an emotionally healthy  state-of  course  not! These  : 
are  both  bearish  patterns and  their  names  clearly  convey  the  unhealthy  : 
state of  the market. 

While the emotional condition of  the market may not be healthy at the 
time these patterns form, it does not preclude the possibility that the mar-  : 
ket will become healthy again. The point is that at the appearance of, say,  i 
a dark-cloud cover,  longs should  take defensive  measures or,  depending  : 
on the general trend and other factors,  new short sales could be initiated.  i 
There are many new patterns and ideas in this book, but the descrip- 
tive names employed by  the Japanese not only make candlestick charting  : 
fun,  but  easier  to  remember  if  the  patterns  are  bullish  or  bearish.  For  i 
example,  in  Chapter  5  you  will  learn  about  the  "evening  star" and  the  : 
"morning star." Without  knowing  what these  patterns  look like or  what  : 
they imply for the market,  just by hearing their names which do you think  i 
is bullish and which is bearish? Of  course,  the evening star  which comes  : 
out before  darkness sets  in,  sounds like  the bearish  signal-and  so it  is!  i 
The  morning  star,  then,  is  bullish  since  the  morning  star  appears  just  : 
before sunrise. 

26 

The Basics 

The other pivotal price point is the close. Margin calls in the futures 
markets  are  based  on  the  close.  We  can  thus  expect  heavy  emotional 
involvement into how the market closes. The close is also a pivotal price 
point for many technicians. They may wait for a close to confirm a break- 
out from a significant chart  point.  Many computer  trading systems (for 
example, moving average systems) are based on closes. If  a large buy or 
sell  order  is  pushed  into  the  market  at,  or  near,  the  close,  with  the 
intention of  affecting the close, the Japanese call this action a night attack. 
Exhibits 3.4 to 3.7 illuminate how the relationship between a period's 
open,  high,  low,  and close alters the look  of  the individual candlestick 
line. Now let us turn our attention to how the candlestick lines, alone or 
in combination, provide clues about market direction. 

CHAPTER  4 

REVERSAL PATTERNS 

--%%ImJ 

"Darkness  Lies  One Inch  Ahead" 

Technicians watch for  price clues that can alert them to a shift in mar- 
ket  psychology  and  trend.  Reversal  patterns  are  these  technical  clues. 
Western  reversal indicators  include  double  tops  and  bottoms,  reversal 
days, head and shoulders, and island tops and bottoms. 

Yet  the term "reversal pattern" is somewhat of  a misnomer. Hearing 
that  term  may  lead  you  to  think  of  an  old  trend  ending  abruptly  and 
then reversing to a new trend. This rarely happens. Trend reversals usu- 
ally occur slowly, in stages, as the underlying psychology shifts gears. 

A trend reversal signal implies that the prior trend is likely to change, 
but not necessarily reverse. This is very important to understand. Com- 
pare  an  uptrend  to  a  car  traveling forward  at  30  m.p.h. The car's  red 
brake lights  go  on and  the car  stops.  The  brake light  was  the  reversal 
indicator showing  that  the prior trend (that is,  the car  moving forward) 
was about to end. But now that the car is stationary will the driver then 
decide  to  put  the  car  in  reverse? Will  he  remained  stopped?  Will  he 
decide to go forward again? Without more clues we do not know. 

Exhibits 4.1 through 4.3 are some examples of  what can happen after 
a top reversal signal appears. The prior uptrend, for instance, could con- 
vert  into  a  period  of  sideways  price  action.  Then  a  new  and  opposite 
trend lower could start.  (See Exhibit 4.1.) Exhibit 4.2 shows how an old 
uptrend can resume. Exhibit 4.3 illustrates how an uptrend can abruptly 
reverse into a downtrend. 

It is prudent to think of  reversal patterns as trend change patterns. I 
was tempted to use the term "trend change patterns" instead of  "rever- 
sal patterns" in this book. However, to keep consistent with other tech- 

28 

The Basics 

EXHIBIT 4.1.  Top Reversal 

EXHIBIT 4.2.  Top Reversal 

EXHIBIT 4.3.  Top  Reversal 

nical  analysis  literature,  I  decided  to  use  the  term  reversal  patterns. 
Remember  that  when  I  say  "reversal  pattern" it  means  only  that  the 
prior trend should change but not necessarily reverse. 

Recognizing  the  emergence  of  reversal  patterns  can  be  a  valuable 
skill. Successful trading entails having both the trend and probability on 
your side.  The  reversal indicators are  the  market's  way  of  providing  a 
road  sign,  such  as  "Caution-Trend  in  Process  of  Change." In  other 
words,  the market's  psychology is in transformation. You  should adjust 
your  trading  style  to  reflect  the  new  market  environment.  There  are 
many ways to trade in and out of  positions with reversal indicators. We 
shall discuss them throughout  the book. 

An important  principle is  to place a new position (based on a rever- 
sal signal) only if  that signal is in the direction of  the major trend. Let us 
say,  for  example,  that in a bull  market,  a  top reversal pattern  appears. 
This bearish signal would  not  warrant a short  sale. This is  because the 
major trend is still up. It  would, however,  signal a liquidation of  longs. 
If  there  was  a  prevailing downtrend,  this  same  top  reversal formation 
could be used to place short sales. 

I have gone into detail about the subject of  reversal patterns because 
most  of  the  candlestick  indicators  are  reversals.  Now,  let  us  turn  our 
attention  to  the first  group of  these candlestick reversal indicators,  the 
hammer and hanging-man lines. 

HAMMER AND HANGING-MAN LINES 

Exhibit 4.4  shows candlesticks with long lower shadows and small real 
bodies. The real  bodies are near  th.e top of  the daily range. The  variety 
of  candlestick lines shown in the exhibit are fascinating in that either line 
can be bullish or bearish depending on where they appear in a trend. If 
either  of  these lines emerges during a downtrend it is  a signal that  the 
downtrend should end. In such a scenario, this line is labeled a hammer,

as in "the market  is  hammering  out" a  base.  See  Exhibit 4.5.  Interest- 
ingly,  the actual Japanese word  for  this line is takuri.  This  word  means 
something  to  the affect  of  "trying  to  gauge  the  depth  of  the water  by 
feeling for its bottom." 

If  either of  the lines in Exhibit 4.4 emerge after a rally it tells you that 
the prior move may be ending. Such a line is ominously called a hanging 
man  (see Exhibit  4.6).  The  name  hanging man is  derived  from  the fact 
that it looks like a hanging man with dangling legs. 

It may seem unusual that the same candlestick line can be both bull- 
ish  and  bearish.  Yet,  for  those  familiar  with  Western  island  tops  and 
island  bottoms  you  will  recognize  that  the identical idea  applies  here. 
The island formation is either bullish or  bearish depending on where it 
is in a trend.  An island  after a prolonged  uptrend is  bearish,  while the 
same island pattern after a downtrend is bullish. 

The hammer and hanging man can be recognized by three criteria: 

1.  The real  body is at the upper end of  the trading  range. The color  of 

the real body is not important. 

2.  A long lower shadow should be twice the height of  the real body 
3.  It should have no, or a very short,  upper shadow. 

The longer the lower shadow, the shorter the upper shadow and the 
smaller  the real body  the more meaningful the bullish hammer  or bear- 
ish  hanging  man.  Although  the  real  body  of  the  hammer  or  hanging 
man can be white or black, it is slightly more bullish if  the real body of 
the  hammer  is  white,  and  slightly more bearish if  the  real body  of  the 
hanging man is  black.  If  a  hammer  has a  white  real body  it  means the 
market  sold  off  sharply  during  the  session  and  then  bounced  back  to 
close  at,  or  near,  the  session's  high.  This  could  have  bullish  ramifica- 
tions.  If  a  hanging  man  has a  black  real body,  it  shows  that  the  close 
could not get back to the opening price level. This could have potentially 
bearish implications. 

It is especially important that you wait for bearish confirmation with 

30 

The Basics 

the hanging man. The logic for this has to do with how the hanging-man 
line is  generated.  Usually  in this kind  of  scenario  the  market  is full of 
bullish  energy.  Then  the  hanging  man  appears.  On  the  hanging-man 
day,  the  market  opens  at  or  near  the  highs,  then sharply sells off,  and 
then rallies  to close at or  near the highs. This might  not be  the type of 
price  action  that  would  let  you  think  the  hanging  man could  be a  top 
reversal. But  this type of  price action now shows once the market starts 
to sell off, it has become vulnerable to a fast break. 

If  the market opens lower the next day,  those who bought on the open 
or  close  of  the hanging-man day are  now left "hanging" with a losing 
position. Thus, the general principle for the hanging man; the greater the 
down gap between the real body of  the hanging-man day and the open- 
ing the next day  the more likely the hanging man will be a top. Another 
bearish verification could be a black real body session with a lower close 
than the hanging-man sessions close. 

Exhibit 4.7 is an excellent example of  how the same line can be bear- 
ish (as in the hanging-man line on July 3) or bullish (the hammer on July 
23). Although both the hanging  man and hammer in this example have 
black bodies,  the color of  the real body is not of  major importance. 

Exhibit  4.8  shows  another  case  of  the  dual  nature  of  these  lines. 
There is a bearish hanging man in mid-April that signaled the end of  the

rally which had started with the bullish hammer on April 2.  A variation 
of  a  hanging man emerged  in  mid-March.  Its lower shadow was long, 
but  not  twice  the  height of  the real body.  Yet  the other  criteria  (a real 
body at the upper end of  the daily range and almost no upper shadow) 
were met. It was also confirmed by a lower close the next day. This line, 
although  not  an  ideal  hanging  man,  did  signal  the  end  of  the  upturn 
which  started  a  month  earlier.  Candlestick  charting  techniques,  like 
other  charting  or  pattern  recognition  techniques,  have  guidelines.  But, 
they are not rigid rules. 

As discussed above, there are certain aspects that increase the impor- 
tance of  hanging-man and hammer lines. But,  as shown in the hanging 
man of  mid-March, a long lower shadow  may not have  to be  twice the 
height of  the real body in order to give a reversal signal. The longer the 
lower shadow,  the more perfect the pattern. 

Exhibit 4.9 shows a series of  bullish hammers numbered 1 to 4 (ham- 
mer 2 is considered a hammer in spite of  its minute upper shadow). The 
interesting feature of  this chart is the buy signal given early in 1990. New 
lows appeared at hammers 3 and 4 as prices moved under the July lows 
at hammer 2. Yet,  there was no continuation to the downside. The bears 
had  their  chance  to  run with  the  ball.  They  fumbled.  The  two  bullish

hammers (3 and 4) show the bulls regained control. Hammer 3 was not 
an ideal hammer since the lower shadow was not twice the height of  the 
real  body.  This  line  did  reflect,  however,  the  failure  of  the  bears  to 
maintain new lows. The following week's hammer reinforced the conclu- 
sion that a bottom reversal was likely to occur. 

In Exhibit 4.10 hammers 1 and 3 are bottoms. Hammer 2 signaled the 
end of  the  prior downtrend as the trend  shifted from down  to neutral. 
Hammer  4  did  not  work.  This  hammer  line  brings  out  an  important 
point  about  hammers  (or  any  of  the  other  patterns  I  discuss).  They 
should be viewed in the context of  the prior price action. In this context, 
look at hammer 4. The day before this  hammer,  the market formed  an 
extremely bearish candlestick line. It was a long, black day with a shaven 
head and a shaven bottom (that is, it opened  on its high and closed on 
its low). This  manifested strong downside  momentum.  Hammer 4 also 
punctured  the  old  support  level  of  January 24.  Considering  the  afore- 
mentioned bearish factors, it would be prudent to wait for  confirmation 
that  the  bulls  were  in  charge  again  before  acting  on  hammer  4.  For 
example, a white candlestick which closed higher than the close of  ham- 
mer 4 might have been viewed as a confirmation. 

Drawing the intra-day chart using candlesticks shows the high,  low, 
open, and close of  the session (see Exhibit 4.11). For example, an hourly

session would have a candlestick line that uses the opening and close for 
that hour in order to determine the real body. The high and low for that 
hour  would  be  used  for  the  upper  and  lower  shadows.  By  looking 
closely at this chart,  one can see that a hammer formed during the first 
hour on April 11. Like hammer 4 in Exhibit 4.10,  prices gapped lower but 
the white candlestick which followed closed higher. This helped to con- 
firm a bottom. 

The second hourly line on April 12, although in the shape of  a ham- 
mer,  was  not  a  true  hammer.  A hammer  is  a  bottom  reversal  pattern. 
One of  the criterion for a hammer is  that there should  be a downtrend 
(even a minor one) in order for  the hammer  to reverse  that  trend. This 
line is not a hanging man either since a hanging man should appear after 
an  uptrend.  In  this  case,  if  this  line  arose  near  the  highs  of  the  prior 
black candlestick session, it would have been considered a hanging man. 
Exhibit 4.12 shows  a  hammer in  early April that  successfully called 
the end of  the major decline which had began months earlier. The long 
lower  shadow,  (many  times  the  height  of  the  real  body) a  small  real 
body, and no upper shadow made this a classic hammer. 

Exhibit 4.13  shows  a  classic  hanging-man  pattern.  New  highs  were 
made  for  the  move  via  an opening  gap  on  the  hanging-man  day.  The

market then gaps lower leaving all those new longs, who bought on the 
hanging man's  open or close, left "hanging" with a losing position. 

In Exhibit 4.14 we see that the rally, which began in early February, 
terminated with  the arrival of  two consecutive hanging-man lines. The 
importance  of  bearish  confirmation  after  the  hanging-man  line  is 
reflected in this chart. One method of  bearish confirmation would be for 
the next day's  open to be under the hanging man's  real body. Note that 
after the appearance of  the first hanging man, the market opened higher. 
However,  after  the  second  hanging  man,  when  the  market  opened 
under the hanging man's  real body, the market backed off. 

Exhibit 4.15 illustrates that a black real body day,  with a lower close 
after  a  hanging-man day,  can  be  another  method  of  bearish confirma- 
tion. Lines 1,  2, and 3 were a series of  hanging-man lines. Lack of  bear- 
ish confirmation after lines 1 and 2 meant the uptrend was still in force.

Observe hanging man 3. The black  candlestick which  followed  pro- 
vided  the bearish  confirmation of  this hanging  man  line.  Although  the 
market opened about unchanged after hanging man 3,  by the time of  its 
close,  just about anyone who bought on the opening or closing of  hang- 
ing man 3 was "hanging" in a losing trade.  (In this case,  the  selloff  on 
the long black candlestick session was so severe that anyone who bought 
on the  hanging-man day-not  just  those who bought  on the open  and 
close-were  left stranded in a losing position.) 

Exhibit 4.16 shows an extraordinary advance in the orange juice mar- 
ket from late 1989  into early 1990.  Observe where this rally stopped. It 
stopped at the hanging man made in the third week of  1990. This chart 
illustrates  the  point  that  a  reversal  pattern  does  not  mean  that  prices  will 
reverse,  as  we  discussed in  Chapter  3.  A reversal indicator  implies  that 
the  prior  trend should  end. That is  exactly  what  happened  here.  After 
the appearance of  the  hanging-man  reversal pattern,  the  prior  uptrend 
ended with  the new trend moving sideways. 

Another  hanging  man  appeared  in  July.  This  time  prices  quickly 
reversed  from  up to down.  But,  as  we  have  discussed  previously,  this 
scenario should not always be expected with a top trend reversal.

a very small real body, no upper shadow, and a long lower shadow. The 
next day's  black real body confirmed this hanging man and indicated a 
time to vacate longs. (Note the bullish hammer in early April.) 

ENGULFING PATTERN 

The hammer and hanging  man are individual candlestick lines.  As  pre- 
viously discussed,  they  can  send  important  signals about  the  market's 
health. Most candlestick signals, however, are based on combinations of 
individual  candlestick  lines.  The  engulfing  pattern  is  the  first  of  these 
multiple candlestick line patterns. The engulfing pattern is a major rever- 
sal signal with two opposite color real bodies composing this pattern. 

Exhibit 4.18 shows a bullish engulfing  pattern. The market is in a down- 
trend, then a white bullish real body wraps around, or engulfs, the prior 
period's  black real body. This shows buying pressure has overwhelmed 
selling  pressure.  Exhibit  4.19 illustrates a  bearish  engulfing  pattern.  Here 
the market is trending higher. The white  real body engulfed  by a black 
body  is  the signal for  a  top reversal.  This shows  the  bears  have  taken 
over from the bulls. 

There are three criteria for an engulfing pattern: 

1.  The  market  has  to  be  in  a  clearly  definable  uptrend  or  downtrend, 

even if  the trend is short term. 

Reversal  Patterns 

39 

EXHIBIT 4.18.  Bullish Engulfing Pattern 

EXHIBIT 4.19.  Bearish Engulfing Pattern 

2.  Two  candlesticks  comprise  the  engulfing  pattern.  The  second  real 
body  must  engulf  the  prior  real  body  (it need  not  engulf  the shad- 
ows). 

3.  The second real body of  the engulfing pattern should be the opposite 
color of  the first real body. (The exception to this rule is if  the first real 
body  of  the engulfing  pattern  is  so  small  it  is  almost a  doji  (or is  a 
doji).  Thus,  after  an  extended  downtrend,  a  tiny  white  real  body 
engulfed by a very large white real body could be a bottom reversal. 
In  an  uptrend,  a  minute  black  real  body  enveloped  by  a  very  large 
black real body could be a bearish reversal pattern). 

The closest analogy  to  the Japanese candlestick engulfing  pattern  is 
the Western reversal  day.  A Western reversal day occurs when, during an 
uptrend (or downtrend), a new high (or low) is made with prices closing 
under (or above) the prior day's close. You  will discover that the engulf- 
ing  pattern  may  give  reversal  signals  not  available  with  the  Western 
reversal day. This may allow you to get a  jump on those who use tradi- 
tional reversal days as a reversal signal. This is probed in Exhibits 4.21, 
4.22, and 4.23. 

Some  factors  that  would  increase  the  likelihood  that  an  engulfing 

pattern would be an important reversal indicator would be: 

1.  If  the first day of  the engulfing pattern has a very small real body and 
the second day  has a very long real body. This would  reflect a dissi- 
pation of  the prior trend's  force and then an increase in force behind 
the new move. 

2.  If  the engulfing pattern appears after a protracted or  very fast move. 
A  protracted  trend  increases  the  chance  that  potential  buyers  are 
already long.  In  this instance,  there may be less of  a supply  of  new 
longs in order to keep the market moving up. A fast move makes the 
market overextended and vulnerable to profit taking. 

3.  If  there  is  heavy  volume  on  the  second  real  body  of  the  engulfing 
pattern. This could  be a blow off  (volume using candlestick charts is 
discussed in Chapter 15). 

40 

The Basics 

EXHIBIT 4.20.  Swiss Franc-Weekly  (Bullish and Bearish Engulfing Patterns) 

4.  If  the second day of  the engulfing pattern engulfs more than one real 

body. 

Exhibit  4.20  shows that  the weeks of  May 15 and  May  22  formed  a 
bullish engulfing pattern.  During  the last  two  weeks  of  July, a bearish 
engulfing  pattern  emerged.  September's  bullish  engulfing  pattern  was 
the bottom of  the selloff  prior to the major rally. 

In  Exhibit  4.21 a  monthly  crude oil  chart  with  both  the  bullish and 
bearish  engulfing  patterns  can  be  seen.  In  late 1985,  a  precipitous  $20 
decline began. The third and fourth month of  1986 showed the two can- 
dlestick lines of  the bullish engulfing pattern. It signaled an end to this 
downtrend. The rally that began with this bullish engulfing pattern con- 
cluded with the bearish engulfing pattern in mid-1987. The small bullish 
engulfing pattern in February and March of  1988 terminated  the down- 
trend that started with the mid-1987 bearish engulfing pattern. After this 
bullish engulfing pattern, the trend went from down to sideways for five 
months. 

The black candlestick of  February 1990 came within 8 ticks of  engulf- 
ing  the  January 1990  white  candlestick.  Consequently,  this  was  not  a 
perfect  bearish  engulfing  pattern  but,  with  candlesticks, as  with  other

charting techniques,  there should be some latitude allowed. It is safer to 
view  this  as  a  bearish  engulfing  pattern  with  all  its  inherently  bearish 
implications  than  to  ignore  that  possibility  just  because  of  8  ticks.  As 
with all charting techniques,  there is always room for subjectivity. 

The bearish engulfing patterns in 1987 and in 1990 convey an advan- 
tage provided by the engulfing pattern-it may give a reversal signal not 
available  using  the  criteria  for  a  reversal  day  in  Western  technicals.  A 
rule for the Western top reversal day (or, in this case, reversal month) is 
that a new high  has to be made for the move.  New highs for  the move 
were  not  made by  the black  real body  periods in the bearish  engulfing 
patterns. Thus, using the criteria for the Western reversal they would not 
be  recognized as  reversal  patterns in  the  United  States.  Yet,  they  were 
reversals with  the candlestick techniques. 

Exhibit 4.22 shows another instance where the candlestick charts may 
allow one to get a  jump on regular bar charting tools. Observe the price 
action on July 7 and 8. Here again, since there was no new high  made, 
there  was  no  sign  of  a  top  reversal  by  using  the  traditional  Western 
reversal day as a gauge. Yet,  with candlesticks, there is a bearish  rever- 
sal signal, namely the bearish engulfing pattern,  does show itself. 

The  two  candlestick lines 1 and  2 in  early  June look  like  a  bullish

engulfing  pattern.  However,  the  bullish engulfing  pattern  is  a  bottom 
trend reversal indicator. This means it must appear after a downtrend (or 
sometimes at the bottom of  a lateral band). In early June, when the bull- 
ish engulfing pattern appeared it did  not warrant action since it did not 
appear in a downtrend. 

Exhibit  4.23  is  a  series  of  bearish  engulfing  patterns.  Pattern  1 
dragged  the  market  into  a  multi-month  lateral  band  from  its  prior 
uptrend. Engulfing pattern 2 only called a temporary respite to the rally. 
Bearish engulfing patterns 3, 4,  and 5 all gave reversal signals that were 
not  available with  Western  technical  techniques  (that is,  since  no  new 
highs  were  made  for  the  move  they  were  not  considered  reversal 
weeks).

DARK-CLOUD  COVER 

Our next reversal pattern is the dark-cloud  cover  (see Exhibit 4.24). It is a 
two candlestick pattern that is a top reversal after a uptrend or, at times, 
at the top of a congestion band. The first day of  this two candlestick pat- 
tern is a strong white real body. The second day's  price opens above the 

44 

The Basics 

EXHIBIT 4.24.  Dark-cloud Cover 

prior session's  high (that is,  above the top of  the upper shadow). How- 
ever, by the end of  the second day's  session,  the market closes near the 
low of  the day and well within the prior day's  white  body. The greater 
the degree of  penetration into the white real body the more likely a top 
will occur. Some Japanese technicians require more than a 50% penetra- 
tion  of  the  black  session's  close  into  the  white  real  body.  If  the  black 
candlestick does  not close below the halfway point of  the white candle- 
stick it may be best to wait for  more bearish confirmation following the 
dark cloud cover. 

The  rationale  behind  this  bearish  pattern  is  readily  explained.  The 
market is in an uptrend. A strong white candlestick is followed by a gap 
higher on the next session's  opening. Thus far, the bulls are in complete 
control. But  then no continuation of  the rally occurs! In fact,  the market 
closes at or near the lows of  the day moving well within the prior day's 
real body. In such a scenario, the longs will have second thoughts about 
their  position.  Those  who  were  waiting  for  selling  short  now  have  a 
benchmark  to  place  a  stop-at  the  new  high  of  the  second  day  of  the 
dark-cloud cover pattern. 

The following is a list of  some factors that intensify the importance of 

dark-cloud covers: 

1.  The  greater  the  degree  of  penetration  of  the  black  real  body's  close 
into the prior white real body,  the greater the chance for a top. If  the 
black  real  body  covers  the  prior  day's  entire  white  body,  a  bearish 
engulfing  pattern  would  occur.  The  dark-cloud  cover's  black  real 
body only gets partially into the white body. Think of  the dark-cloud 
cover  as a  partial solar eclipse  blocking out  part  of  the sun  (that is, 
covers only part of  the prior white body). The bearish engulfing  pat- 
tern can be viewed as a total solar eclipse blocking out the entire sun 
(that is,  covers the  entire  white  body). A  bearish  engulfing  pattern, 
consequently,  is a more meaningful top reversal. If  a long, white real 
body  closes above  the  highs of  the  dark-cloud  cover,  or  the  bearish 
engulfing pattern, it could presage another rally. 

Reversal Patterns 

45 

2.  During  a  prolonged  uptrend,  if  there  is  a  strong  white  day  which 
opens on its low (that is, a shaven bottom) and closes on its high (that 
is,  a  shaven  head) and  the  next  day  reveals a  long  black  real  body 
day,  opening on its high and closing on its low,  then a shaven head 
and shaven bottom black day have occurred. 

3.  If  the  second  body  (that is,  the  black  body) of  the  dark-cloud  cover 
opens above  a  major  resistance level and  then fails,  it  would  prove 
the bulls were unable to take control of  the market. 

4.  If,  on the  opening of  the  second  day  there is  very  heavy volume,  a 
buying blow off  could have occurred. For  example, heavy volume at 
a new opening high could mean that many new buyers have decided 
to jump aboard ship. Then the market sells offs. It probably won't  be 
too long before this multitude of new longs (and old longs who have 
ridden  the  uptrend)  realize  that  the  ship  they  jumped  onto  is  the 
Titanic. For futures traders,  very high opening interest can be another 
warning. 

Exhibit  4.25  demonstrates  the  difference  between  the  dark-cloud 
cover  and  the  bearish  engulfing pattern.  The  two  candlesticks in  June 
1989 constitute  a dark-cloud  cover.  A long,  white  real body  is followed 
by  a long,  black real body. The black  real  body  opened  on  a  new high 
for the move and then closed near its lows and well into the prior day's

white  real  body.  The  municipal bond  market  backed  off  after  this  top 
reversal appeared. The final coup  de  grace  came a few weeks later when 
the bearish engulfing pattern  materialized. We  see  how  the dark-cloud 
cover's  black  real body  covered only  part of  the prior white  real body. 
The black real body of  the bearish engulfing pattern enveloped the entire 
previous white real body. 

In  Exhibit  4.26  three  dark-cloud  covers  can  be  seen.  Other  bearish 
signals confirmed each of  these patterns. Let us look at them on an indi- 
vidual basis. 

1.  Dark-cloud  cover  1.  This  is  a  variation  on  the  ideal  dark-cloud  cover 
pattern.  In  this  dark-cloud  cover,  the  second  day's  black  real  body 
opened  at the prior day's  high instead  of  above it.  It was still only a 
warning sign but it was viewed as a negative factor. This dark-cloud 
cover also signified a failed attempt by the bulls to take out resistance 
at the mid-February highs. 

2.  Dark-cloud  cover  2.  Besides  this  dark-cloud cover,  there  was  another 
reason for  caution at  this $21 level. A  technical axiom is that  a  prior 
support  level,  once  broken,  can  convert  to  new  resistance.  That  is 
what happened at $21.  Note how the old $21 support, once breached 

 
 
Reversal  Patterns

on March 9,  converted  to  resistance. The failed  rally  attempt  during 
the dark-cloud cover pattern during the first two days of  April proved 
this resistance. (Chapter 11 examines this concept of  the interchange- 
ability of  support and resistance.) 

3.  Dark-cloud cover  3. This shows that there was also a failure at a resis- 

tance zone made during the late April highs. 

These  are  instances  where  the  bearish  dark-cloud  cover  coincided 
with resistance levels. This concept, where more than one technical indi- 
cator corroborates another,  is important. It is the main focus of  the sec- 
ond  half  of  this book  where  the  combination of  candlestick techniques 
with other technical tools is discussed. 

Exhibit 4.27  shows  that  during  the  early  part  of  March,  dark-cloud 
cover 1 halted  a  two-week  rally.  A week-long correction ensued.  Two 
more dark-cloud covers formed in April. Dark-cloud cover 2 hinted that 
the prior sharp two-day rally was probably over. Dark-cloud cover 3,  in 
mid-April,  was  especially  bearish.  Why  did  this  dark-cloud  cover  turn 
out to be so negative? The reason has to do with the psychology of  this 
pattern. 

As noted  previously,  the rationale behind  the negative aspect  of  the

dark-cloud cover is the result  of  a new high on the open, with  the mar- 
ket closing deeply into the prior white  real body. What would  happen, 
though,  if,  on  the second  day  of  the dark-cloud  cover,  the  open  pene- 
trates the highs not from days, or even weeks ago, but from months ago 
and  then  fails  at  these  new  highs? This  would  produce  very  negative 
connotations.  This  is  the  scenario  that  unfolded  in  April.  The  highest 
levels  in  at  least  three  months  were  touched  on  the  black  candlestick 
session of  dark-cloud cover 3. This high failed to hold and prices closed 
well within the prior white real body. 

In Exhibit 4.28, we see that the price incline commencing February 10 

came to an abrupt halt with the mid-February dark-cloud cover. 

PIERCING PATTERN 

During  many  of my  speaking  engagements,  after  I have  discussed  the 
bearish  dark-cloud cover  pattern, it's  not  too long  before  I  am  asked  if 
there  is  an  opposite  formation.  Yes,  there  is  and  it  is  called  a  piercing 
pattern.  Just as  a  dark-cloud  cover  is  a  top  reversal,  its  opposite,  the 
piercing pattern, is a bottom reversal (see Exhibit 4.29). It is composed of 
two candlesticks in a falling market.  The first candlestick is  a black  real 
body day and the second is a long, white real body day. This white day 
opens sharply lower,  under the low of  the prior black day. Then  prices

EXHIBIT  4.29.  Piercing Pattern 

push higher, creating a relatively long, white real body that closes above 
the mid-point of  the prior day's  black real body. 

The bullish piercing pattern  is akin  to the bullish engulfing pattern. 
In the bullish engulfing pattern the white real body engulfs the previous 
black  real  body.  With  the  bullish piercing pattern,  the  white  real  body 
only pierces the prior black body. In the piercing pattern,  the greater the 
degree of  penetration into the black  real body,  the more likely it will be 
a bottom reversal.  An ideal piercing pattern  will have a white real body 
that pushes more than halfway into the  prior session's  black real body. 
If  the  market  closes  under  the  lows  of  the  bullish  engulfing  pattern  or 
the  piercing  pattern  by  way  of  a  long  black  candlestick,  then  another 
downleg should  resume. 

The psychology behind the piercing pattern is as follows: The market 
is in a downtrend. The bearish black real body reinforces this view. The 
next day  the market opens lower via  a gap. The bears are watching the 
market  with  contentment.  Then  the  market  surges  toward  the  close, 
managing not  only  to  close  unchanged  from  the  prior  day's  close,  but 
sharply  above  that level. The bears  will be  second  guessing  their  posi- 
tion. Those who are looking to buy would say new lows could not hold 
and perhaps it is time to step in from the long side. 

The  piercing  pattern  signal  increases  in  importance  based  on  the 
same factors (1) through (4) as with the dark-cloud cover, but in reverse. 
(See previous  section.) In  the  section  on  the  dark-cloud  cover,  I  men- 
tioned  that  although  some  Japanese  traders  like  to  see  the  black  real 
body  close  more  that  midway  in  the  prior  white  candlestick,  there  is 
some flexibility to this rule. With the piercing pattern, there is less flexi- 
bility. The  piercing  pattern's  white  candlestick should  push  more  than 
halfway into  the  black  candlestick's  real body. The  reason  for  less  lati- 
tude with  the bullish  piercing pattern  than with  the bearish  dark-cloud 
cover  pattern  is  the  fact  that  the  Japanese  have  three  other  patterns 
called  the on-neck, the in-neck, and the thrusting  pattern (see Exhibits 4.30 
to 4.32) that have  the same basic formation as the piercing pattern, but 
which  are viewed  as bearish  signals since the white  real body gets less 
than halfway into the black's real body.

Thus  these  three  potentially  bearish  patterns  (Exhibits 4.30 to  4.32) 
and  the  bullish  piercing pattern  (Exhibit 4.29) all  have  the  same  form. 
The difference between them is in the degree of  penetration by the white 
candlestick into the black candlestick's real body. The on-neck pattern's 
white candlestick (usually a small one) closes near  the low of  the previ- 
ous session.  The in-neck pattern's  white candlestick closes slightly into 
the  prior  real  body  (it should  also  be  a  small  white  candlestick).  The 
thrusting pattern  should  be  a  longer  white  candlestick that is  stronger 
than the in-neck pattern but still does not close above the middle of  the 
prior black real body. 

With  these  patterns,  as  prices  move  under  the  white  candlestick's 
low,  the trader knows that it's  time to sell. (Note that the thrusting pat- 
tern in Exhibit 4.32 is bearish in a declining market,  but as part of  a ris- 
ing market,  would  be  considered  bullish.  The  thrusting  pattern  is  also 
bullish if  it occurs twice within several days of  each other.) 

It  is  not  important  to  remember  the  individual  patterns  in  Exhibits 
4.30 to 4.32. Just remember the concept that the white candlestick should 
push more than halfway into the black candlestick's real body to send a 
bottom reversal signal. 

In  Exhibit  4.33,  the  bears  successfully knocked  the  market  to  new 
lows for the move on April 27 as shown by the long black day. The next 
day the market opened lower. This opening turned out to be the low of 
the day and  Boeing closed  well within  the  prior  day's  black  real body. 
The two candlesticks on April 27 and 28 created the bullish piercing pat- 
tern. 

Exhibit  4.34  shows  a  classic  piercing  pattern  during  the  week  of 
March  26.  Note  how  the  white  real  body  followed  a  very  weak  long, 
black real body. The white day opened on a new low for the move. The 
strong  close  that  day,  which  pushed  well  into  the  previous  black  real 
body,  was a  powerful indication  that  the bears  lost control of  the  mar- 
ket. The white day was a very strong session. It opened on its low (that

is,  a shaven  bottom) and closed its  high  (that is,  a shaven  head). Note 
how this bullish piercing pattern brought to an end the selloff  that com- 
menced with the bearish engulfing pattern of  March 19 and 20. 

On this Wheat chart  there is also a variation of  the piercing  pattern 
during the week of  March 12. The reason it is a variation is because the 
white  real body opened  under the prior day's  real body,  but not under 
the  prior  day's  low.  Nonetheless,  because  the  white  real  body  closed 
more than 50% into the prior day's  black real body it was a warning sign 
that the prior downleg was running out of  steam. 

Exhibit 4.35 illustrates how candlestick patterns can help the analyst 
get a quick sense of  the market's health. During the latter part of  Febru- 
ary 1990, a broker asked me what I thought of  oats. I rarely monitor oats. 
Nonetheless, I retrieved the candlestick chart shown in Exhibit 4.35 and 
told him that the downtrend was probably over. Why? I had noticed that 
during  the  week  of  February  20,  an  almost  classic  piercing  pattern 
appeared. I also saw this piercing pattern coincided with a successful test 
of  the early February lows. This increased the chance that a double bot- 
tom had been built. 

Exhibit  4.36  illustrates  that  the  downtrend,  which  began  with  the 
bearish  engulfing  pattern  in  late  1984,  ended  in  mid-1987  with  the

appearance of  this  piercing pattern.  Although the  market  did  not  rally 
after  this bottom  reversal signal,  the  signal did forecast  the  end  of  the 
selling pressure that had pulled the market down from mid-1984 to mid- 
1987. After the piercing pattern the market stabilized for a year, and then 
rallied. 

CHAPTER  3 

STARS 

FHA  1-% 

3 12 a L l  

"One cannot  be  too cautious" 

O n e  group of  fascinating reversal patterns is that which includes stars. 
A star is a small real body that gaps away from the large real body pre- 
ceding it (see Exhibit 5.1). It is still a star as long as the star's  real body 
does not overlap the prior real body. The color of  the star is not impor- 
tant.  Stars can  occur  at  tops  or  at  bottoms  (sometimes a  star  during a 
downtrend is labeled a rain drop). If  the star is a doji instead of  a small 
real body, it is called a doji  star  (see Exhibit 5.2). 

The  star,  especially  the  doji  star,  is  a  warning  that  the  prior  trend 
may be ending. The star's  small real body represents a stalemate in the 
tug of  war  between  the bulls and bears.  In a strong  uptrend,  the bulls 
are in charge. With the emergence of  a star after a long white candlestick 
in an uptrend, it is a signal of  a shift from the buyers being in control to 
a  deadlock  between  the  buying  and  selling  forces.  This  deadlock  may 
have occurred either  because of a diminution  in  the buying force or  an 
increase  in  the  selling  force.  Either  way,  the  star  tells  us  the  prior 
uptrend power has dissipated and the market is vulnerable to a setback. 
The same is true,  but in reverse, for a star in a downtrend. That is, if 
a  star  follows  a  long  black  candlestick  in  a  downtrend,  it  reflects  a 
change in the market environment. For example,  during the downtrend 
the bears  were  in  command  but  a change is seen  in  the advent  of  the 
star, which signals an environment in which the bulls and the bears are 
more in equilibrium. The downward energy has thus been cooled. This 
is not a favorable scenario for a continuation of  the bear market.

The star is part of  four reversal patterns including: 

1.  the evening star; 
2.  the morning  star; 
3.  the doji star; and 
4.  the shooting  star. 

In  any  of  these  star  patterns  the  real body  of  the star  can  be  white  or 
black. 

THE  MORNING  STAR 

The morning star  (see Exhibit 5.3) is a bottom  reversal pattern. Its name 
is derived because, like the morning star (the planet Mercury) that fore- 
tells the sunrise, it presages higher prices. It is comprised of  a tall, black 
real  body  followed  by  a  small  real  body  which  gaps  lower  (these two 
lines  comprise a  basic star  pattern). The  third  day is  a  white  real body 
that moves well within  the first period's  black real body. This pattern is 
a signal that the bulls have seized control. I will break down this three- 
candlestick pattern into its components in order to understand the ratio- 
nale behind this last statement.

The market is in a downtrend when we see a black real body. At this 
time  the  bears  are  in command.  Then  a  small  real  body  appears.  This 
means sellers are losing the capacity to drive the market lower. The next 
day,  the  strong  white  real  body  proves  that  the bulls have  taken  over. 
An  ideal  morning  star  would  have  a  gap  before  and  after  the  middle 
line's  real body  (that is,  the star). This second  gap is rare,  but lack  of  it 
does not seem to vitiate the power of  this formation. 

Exhibit 5.4 shows that a bullish morning star pattern developed dur- 
ing December 19 through 21. The rally  that began with this  pattern ran 
out of  steam with  the dark-cloud cover on December 26 and 27. Exhibit 
5.5 shows  that  the  October  lows  were  made  via  a  star  (the small  real 
body in  the first week in October). The week after  this star,  the market 
had a strong white real body. This white real body completed the morn- 
ing  star  pattern.  The  black  candlestick  after  this  white  body  formed  a 
dark-cloud cover. The market then temporarily backed off. The morning 
star  nonetheless became a  major  bottom.  Exhibit 5.6 shows  a  variation 
on the  morning  star  in  which  there is  more  than  one  star  (in this case 
there are three "stars"). Note how the third small real body session (that 
is,  the third  star) was a hammer and a bullish engulfing line.

THE  EVENING STAR 

The evening star is the bearish counterpart  of  the morning star pattern. 
It is  aptly  named  because  the evening  star  (the planet  Venus) appears 
just  before  darkness  sets  in. Since  the evening  star  is  a  top  reversal it 
should be acted on if  it arises after an uptrend. Three lines compose the 
evening star  (see Exhibit 5.7). The first two lines are a long,  white real 
body followed by a star. The star is the first hint of  a top. The third line 
corroborates a  top and completes the  three-line  pattern  of  the evening 
star. The third line is a black real body that moves sharply into the first 
periods white real body. I like to compare the evening star  pattern  to a 
traffic light. The traffic light goes from green (the bullish white real body)

to yellow (the star's  warning signal) to red (the black real body confirms 
the prior trend has stopped). 

In principle, an evening star should have a gap between the first and 
second  real bodies and  then another gap between the second  and third 
real bodies.' However, from my experience this second gap is rarely seen 
and  is  not  necessary  for  the success of  this  pattern.  The  main  concern 
should  be the extent  of  the intrusion of  the third  day's  black real body 
into the first day's  white real body. 

At  first  glance  Exhibit  5.7 is  like  an  island  top  reversal  as  used  by 
Western technicians.  Analyzing the evening star  more  closely shows it 
furnishes a reversal signal  not  available with an island  top (see Exhibit 
5.8). For an island top,  the low of  session 2 has to be above the highs of 
sessions 1 and 3. However, the evening star only requires the low of  the 
real body 2 to be above the high of  real body 1 to be a reversal signal. 

The evening star pattern shown in Exhibit 5.9 reflects the Summer of 
1987 which called the high of  the Dow just before the crash. (I wonder if 
the Japanese technicians who use candlesticks were looking at this!) 

Exhibit 5.10  provides an example  of  how  candlestick indicators  can 
transmit  a reversal signal  not easily found  with Western tools. The last

hour  on September 5 and  the  first  two  hours  the  next  day  formed  an 
evening star pattern. The star portion of  this evening star pattern would 
not have been an island top based on the aforementioned discussion. In 
this instance,  candlesticks provided a  top  reversal indication  not  avail- 
able  with  the  Western island  top.  Also  note  how  the  rally  that  ended 
with this evening star began with the morning star on September 4. 

Although more important after an uptrend,  the evening star can be 
important at the top of  a congestion band if  it confirms another bearish 
signal. (See Exhibit 5.11.) That is what happened in the middle of  April. 
The star  portion  (that is,  the second day) of  the evening star coincided 
with a  resistance area.  The  basis  for  this  resistance at $413  was  that  it 
was an old support level from late March. Old support often converts to 
new  resistance.  Try  to  remember  this! It  is  a  very  useful  trading  rule.

the  resistance  level  near  $413  coincided  with  the  appearance  of  the 
evening star thus reinforcing the negativeness of  the pattern. 

Exhibit 5.12 shows a well-defined evening star in mid-December. The 
star was preceded by a strong, white real body and followed by a weak, 
black  real  body.  A  variation  of  an  evening  star  appeared  in  mid- 
November. The reason it was a variation is that the evening star usually 
has  a  long,  white  real  body  preceding  the  star,  and  then  a  black  real 
body  after  the  star.  We  did  not  see  the  long,  white  or  black  real  body 
lines here. We  view this as a top, however, not only because of  its minor 
resemblance to an evening star pattern,  but because of  the hanging-man 
line on November 21 (the "star" portion  of  the evening star). The next 
day's  opening under the hanging man's  real body confirmed a top. 

Some  factors that  would  increase  the  likelihood  that  an  evening  or 

morning star could be a reversal would include: 

1.  If  there is a gap between the first candlestick's and star's  real bodies 

and then in the star's  and third candlestick's real bodies; 

2.  If  the  third  candlestick closes  deeply  into  the  first  candlestick's  real 

body;

:  A HSTORICAL NOTE 

i 
:  The full name of  the evening and morning star  patterns are the three-river 
: evening  star and the three-river morning star.  I  originally thought they were  : 
i 
: termed  "three-river" evening  and  morning  stars  because  each  of  these 
:  patterns had three candlestick lines-hence three rivers. I discovered that  : 
i  the origin is much more fascinating. 
Nobunaga  Oda,  a  major military  figure  of  the late 16th  century,  was  i 
: 
:  one of  the three military leaders who unified feudal Japan (see Chapter 2).  : 
i  He  fought  a  seminal  battle  that  occurred  in  a  very  fertile  rice  growing  : 
: province. Since rice was a gauge of  wealth,  Nobunaga was as determined  i 
to wrest this area as fervently as the owners were to defend it. This fertile  : 

: rice area had three  rivers. The heavily defended  area made it difficult for 
:  Nobunaga  to  cross  these  three  rivers.  Victory  was  his  when  his  forces 
i  finally forded  these  three  rivers.  Hence  the name "three  river" morning  : 
: and evening star where it is difficult to change  the trend. Yet,  victory for  i 
:  the  attacking  army  is  assured  when  the  hurdle  of  the  "three  rivers" is  : 
; crossed.

3.  If  there is light volume on the first candlestick session and heavy vol- 
ume on the third candlestick session. This would show a reduction of 
the force for  the  prior trend and an increase in the direction force of 
the new trend. 

THE  MORNING AND EVENING DOJI STARS 

When a doji gaps above a real body in a rising market,  or gaps under a 
real  body  in  a  falling  market,  that  doji  is  called  a  doji  star.  Exhibit 5.2 
shows doji stars.  Doji stars are a  potent  warning that the  prior trend is 
apt to change. The session after the doji should confirm the trend rever- 
sal. Accordingly, a doji star in an uptrend followed by a long,  black real 
body  that  closed  well  into  the  white  real  body  would  confirm  a  top 
reversal.  Such  a  pattern is  called  an evening  doji  star  (see Exhibit 5.13). 
The  evening  doji  star  is  a  distinctive form  of  the  regular  evening  star. 
The regular evening star pattern has a small real body as its star (that is, 
the second  candlestick), but the evening doji star  has a doji as its star. 
The evening doji star is more important because it contains a doji. 

A doji star during an uptrend is often the sign of  an impending top. 
It is important to note that if  the session after the doji star is a white can- 
dlestick which gaps higher,  the bearish nature of  the doji star is negated.

In a downtrend,  if  there is a black real body, followed by a doji star, 
confirmation of  a bottom reversal would occur if  the next session  was a 
strong,  white  candlestick  which  closed  well  into  the  black  real  body. 
That  three  candlestick  pattern  is  called  a  morning  doji  star  (see  Exhibit 
5.14). This type of  morning star can be a meaningful  bottom. If,  during 
a downtrend, a black candlestick gaps under the doji star,  the potentially 
bullish implications of  the doji star is voided. This is why it is important 
to wait for confirmation in the next session or  two with doji stars. 

If  there is an upside gap doji star (that is,  the shadows do not touch) 
followed  by  a  downside  gap black  candlestick where  the  shadows also 
do not  touch,  the  star is considered a  major  top  reversal signal.  This is 
called an abandoned  baby  top (see Exhibit 5.15). This  pattern is very rare! 
The same is true,  only in  reverse, for  a bottom. Specifically,  if  there 
is a doji star that has a gap before and after it (where the shadows do not 
touch) it  should  be  a  major  bottom.  This  pattern  is  referred  to  as  an 
abandoned  baby  bottom  (see  Exhibit  5.16). It  is  also  extremely  rare!  The 
abandoned baby is like a Western island top or bottom where the island 
session would be a doji. 

Exhibit 5.17 shows that a doji star in early June halted the prior price 
decline. It is still called  a star although  the shadow of  the doji star bot- 
tom overlaps the prior day's  black real body. When the white real body 
appeared  after  the  star,  confirmation  of  the  downturn  was  over.  The

black  real body before and the white real body after the doji star  made 
this three-line pattern a morning doji star. 

On the doji star candlestick of  Exhibit 5.18,  prices broke under $35. 
This was a support area from early in July. The fact  that  the new lows 
could  not hold  is considered  bullish. Add  to this  the morning doji star 
pattern and you have two reasons to suspect a bottom. 

Exhibit 5.19 is an example of  both an evening doji star and a regular 
evening  star.  Price  action  from  March  through  May  1986  formed  an 
evening  doji star.  This  pattern  halted  a sharp rally  which  began  just  a 
few  months  previously.  A selloff  ensued after this evening doji star.  It 
ended with  the bullish engulfing pattern.  The rally from that engulfing 
pattern topped during the evening star pattern of  mid-1987. 

In Exhibit 5.20,  we see the three lines that form the evening doji star 
on March 17, 18, and 19. This pattern ended the rally that began with a 
hammer  the prior week. This example again shows that certain candle- 
stick configurations should have more latitude in the equity market. This 
is  because,  unlike futures,  stock  prices may open relatively  unchanged 
from  the  prior  close.  This  means  that  specific  patterns  that  relate  the 
open to the prior day's  close may have to be adjusted for this fact. 

In the case of  Dow Chemical, note how the evening doji star was not

a true star. A doji star's  real body (that is,  its opening and closing price) 
should  be  over  the  prior  day's  real  body.  Here  it  was  not.  Therefore, 
allow more flexibility with candlestick indicators with equities. For those 
who  monitor  the  equity  markets,  as  you  experiment  with  candlestick 
techniques,  you  should discover  which  patterns  may  have  to  be  modi- 
fied. 

In Exhibit 5.21, one can see that a few weeks before 1987's  major sell- 
off,  an evening doji star top arose. The center candlestick of  this pattern 
(the doji star) did not gap above the prior white candlestick as should a 
true star. However, as discussed in Exhibit 5.20,  one should allow more 
latitude  with  this  concept  of  gaps  since  stocks  often  open  at,  or  very 
near,  the prior session's  close. 

Exhibit 5.22 reveals a very  unusual and ominous  occurrence in  that 
back-to-back evening doji patterns formed. Candlestick lines 1 through 3 
formed an evening doji star. The next three sessions, lines 4 through 6, 
fashioned another evening doji star.

THE  SHOOTING  STAR  AND THE  INVERTED HAMMER 

A shooting star  is a two-line pattern that sends a warning of  an impend- 
ing top. It looks like its name,  a shooting star.  It is  usually not a major 
reversal signal as is the evening star. As  shown in the Exhibit 5.23,  the 
shooting star  has a small real body at the lower end of  its range with a 
long  upper shadow.  As  with  all  stars,  the color  of  the real body  is not 
important.  The shooting star pictorially  tells us that the market opened 
near its low, then strongly rallied and finally backed off  to close near the 
opening. In other words,  that session's  rally could not be sustained. 

An  ideal  shooting  star  has  a  real  body  which  gaps  away  from  the 
prior real body.  Nonetheless,  as will be seen in several chart examples, 
this gap is not always necessary. 

A shooting star shaped candlestick after a downturn could be a bull- 
ish signal. Such a line is called an inverted  hammer. The inverted hammer 
line is discussed later in this chapter. 

In  Exhibit 5.24, one  can  see  that  on  April 2,  a bearish shooting  star 
was signaling trouble overhead. Exhibit 5.25 well illustrates the shooting 
star and its variations. Shooting star variations include the following: 

1.  Shooting  star  1  is a variation on a shooting star. It is  not an ideal star 
because  there  is  no  gap  between  the  real  bodies.  It,  nonetheless, 
proves the failure of  the bulls to maintain their drive. 

2.  Shooting  star  2  is  of  little importance.  It  does meet part of  the criteria 
of  a shooting star (that is, a star with a small real body and long upper 
shadow). Yet,  it  fails to meet one important rule.  It  does  not appear 
after  an  uptrend  nor  at  the  top  of  a  congestion  zone.  As  such,  it 
should be viewed as a small real body day with little significance. A 
small  real  body  (that is,  a  spinning  top)  reflects  indecision.  In  the 
middle of  a trading range indecision should be expected. 

3.  Shooting  star  3  has the shape of  the shooting  star  but it is not a  true 
star  since it  does  not gap  away from  the  prior  real body.  However, 
this day's  shooting star should be viewed in context of  the prior price 
action. The top of  the upper shadow for shooting star 3 is an assault

at the early August high at $6.18. The bulls exhausted  themselves on 
the intra-day  rally  to  that  level.  The  soybeans  then  closed  near  the 
low of  the day. 

4.  Shooting star 4 is very similar to shooting star 3. It also is not an ideal 
shooting star since its real body did not gap away from the prior real 
body.  Yet  it  was  another  rally  attempt  that  faltered  near  $6.18.  It 
proved that the bulls could not gain control. 

(Shooting stars  3  and  4,  although  not  ideal  shooting  star  patterns, 
bring out an important  point.  As I said in the beginning of  the book, 
the patterns do not have to be perfectly formed to provide a valid sig- 
nal. Always view candlestick lines and patterns in the context of  the 
other technical evidence. Thus, shooting stars 3 and 4 were not ideal, 
yet the shape of  the shooting star line, itself, in context with the prior 
action, was bearish.) 

5.  Shooting star 5 is another failure at resistance. You  have to admire the 
bulls'  tenacity,  though,  in  trying  to  push  this  market  higher.  With 
each failure at the $6.18 resistance, one has to wonder how long will 
it be before the bulls give up. We  get the answer with shooting star 6. 
6 .   Shooting star 6  was the final failed push. The bulls then gave way. The 

hammer then called the end of  the selloff. 

Exhibit 5.26 is another example where  the shooting star  pattern  did 
not gap away from the prior real body. It was, nonetheless, a significant 
reversal signal. Here again let us look at the shooting star in context. It 
was  another  failure  at  the  third  quarter  1989  highs.  The  shooting  star 
spelled the end of  a rally that began with the hammer. 

Exhibit 5.27 reveals  that a classic shooting  star  made its appearance 
in  the  first  hour  of  May  29.  The  ensuing  price  decline  stopped  at  the 
bullish engulfing pattern on June 4. 

Exhibit 5.28 illustrates two  shooting  stars  that  preceded  meaningful 
price declines. Exhibit 5.29 shows that the shooting star was also a fail- 
ure  at  the  October/November 1989  highs.  A double  whammy!  Exhibit 
5.30 shows a pair of  shooting stars. Each spelled the end of  the preced- 
ing rally.

THE INVERTED HAMMER 

While not a star  pattern,  we'll  discuss the inverted  hammer in this sec- 
tion  because  of  its  resemblance  to  the  shooting  star.  Exhibit 5.31 illus- 
trates that an inverted  hammer looks like a shooting star line with its long 
upper shadow and  small real body  at the lower  end of  the  range. But, 
while  the shooting  star  is a  top reversal line,  the inverted  hammer is a 
bottom reversal line. As with a regular hammer, the inverted hammer is 
a bullish pattern after a downtrend. 

Refer back to the corn chart discussed in Exhibit 5.27. Look at the first 
candlestick of  the  bullish  engulfing  pattern  of  June 4.  It  has  the  same 
appearance as the shooting star (the color of  the real body does not mat- 

76 

The Basics 

ter). In this instance, it appears during a downtrend and thus it becomes 
a potentially bullish inverted hammer. 

It is important to wait for bullish verification on the session following 
the inverted  hammer.  Verification could  be in the form of  the next day 
opening above the inverted  hammer's  real body. The larger the gap the 
stronger  the  confirmation. A  white  candlestick  with  higher  prices can 
also be another form of  confirmation. 

The reason bullish verification of  the inverted hammer is important is 
because the  price action that forms the inverted hammer  appears  bear- 
ish.  To  wit,  on  the  inverted  hammer  session  the  market  opens  on,  or 
near  its  low,  then  rallies.  The  bulls  fail  to  sustain  the  rally  and  prices 
close at,  or near,  the lows of  the session. Why should a line like this be 
a  potentially bullish  reversal signal? The  answer  has  to  do  with  what 
happens over the next session. If  the next day opens above the real body 
of  the inverted  hammer,  it means those who shorted at the opening or 
closing  of  the  inverted  hammer  day  are  losing  money.  The  longer  the 
market  holds  above  the  inverted  hammer's  real  body  the  more  likely 
these  shorts  will  cover.  This  could  spark  a  short  covering  rally  which 
could lead to bottom pickers going long. This could feed upon itself  and 
a rally could be the result. 

In  the corn example,  the inverted  hammer  was followed in the next 
session by a bullish engulfing line. That line served as confirmatory price 
action. 

As  seen  in  Exhibit  5.32,  shooting  star  1 eased  the  market  into  an 
essentially lateral band  from  its  prior  strong  rallying  mode.  The  black 
candlestick after shooting star 3 corroborated a top since it completed a 
bearish engulfing pattern.  The decline that  started with  shooting  star 3 
ended  with  the March  27  and 28  piercing  pattern.  This  pattern  formed 
the foundation  for  a rally which terminated  at shooting star  4.  Observe 
where  the  decline  after  shooting  4  stopped-an  inverted  hammer  on 
April  21  which  was  substantiated  by  the  next  day's  higher  white  real 
body. If  this white real body was longer, we could say there was a bull- 
ish  morning  star  (the black  real body before  the inverted  hammer,  the 
inverted  hammer,  and  the  white  real  body  after  the  hammer  would 
make  up  this  three  candlestick morning  star  pattern  if  the  third  white 
line  was  longer). The  rally initiated  with  the  bullish inverted  hammer 
pushed prices up, until another-you guessed it-shooting  star at 5. 

Exhibit  5.33  illustrates  other  examples  of  inverted  hammers.  Note 
how inverted  hammers 1 and  2 were  confirmed by  stronger  prices the 
following day.  This is  important.  Inverted  hammer  2 became  part  of  a 
morning star pattern.

"Put a Lid  on  What  Smells  Bad" 

T h e  reversal formations  in  Chapters 4 and  5 are comparatively strong 
reversal signals. They show that the bulls have taken over from the bears 
(as in the bullish engulfing pattern, a morning star, or a piercing pattern) 
or  that the  bears have wrested control from  the  bulls (as in the bearish 
engulfing pattern,  the evening star, or the dark-cloud cover). This chap- 
ter examines more reversal indicators which are usually, but not always, 
less  powerful reversal signals. These include  the harami pattern,  tweezers 
tops and bottoms, belt-hold lines, the upside-gap two crows, and counter-attack 
lines.  This  chapter  then  explores  strong  reversal  signals  that  include 
three black crows, three mountains, three rivers, dumpling tops, fry pan 
bottoms,  and tower tops and bottoms. 

THE  HARAMI  PATTERN 

The  harami  pattern  (see  Exhibit  6.1)  is  a  small  real  body  which  is  con- 
tained  within a prior relatively long real body. "Harami" is an old Japa- 
nese  word  for  "pregnant."  The  long  candlestick  is  "the  mother" 
candlestick and the small candlestick as the "baby" or "fetus." In Chap- 
ter  3,  we  discussed  how  spinning tops  (that is,  small  real  bodies)  are 
useful in certain formations.  The harami is one of  these formations  (the 
star, examined in Chapter 5,  is another).

EXHIBIT 6.1.  Harami 

EXHIBIT 6.2.  Inside Day 

The  harami  pattern  is  the  reverse  of  the  engulfing  pattern.  In  the 
engulfing  pattern,  a lengthy  real body engulfs  the  preceding  small real 
body.  For  the  harami,  a small real body  follows an unusually long  real 
body. For  the two candlesticks of  the engulfing  pattern  the color of the 
real bodies should be opposite to one another. This is not necessary-for 
the harami. You  will find,  however,  that in most instances, the real bod- 
ies in  the  harami are  oppositely  colored. Exhibit 6.7 displays  the differ- 
ence between the engulfing and harami patterns. 

The  harami  formation  is  comparable  to  the Western inside day.  An 
inside day occurs when the highs and lows are within the prior  period's 
range  (see  Exhibit  6.2).  Yet,  while  a  Western  inside  day  is  usually 
thought  of  as  having  little,  or  no,  forecasting  importance,  the  harami 
pattern  predicts  that  the  market  will  separate  from  its  previous  trend. 
While a Western inside session requires the high and low be within the 
prior session's  range,  the harami requires a narrow opening and closing 
range (that is, a small real body) to be within the prior wide opening and 
closing range  (that is,  a tall real body). 

The  harami  pattern  is  usually  not  as  much  of  a  significant  reversal 
signal  as  are,  say,  the  hammer,  hanging  man,  or  engulfing  patterns. 
With the harami a brake has been applied to the market; the immediate 
preceding trend should end and the market will often come to a lull. At 
times,  the  harami can  warn of  a significant  trend  change-especially at 
market tops. 

Exhibit 6.3 illustrates a distinctive type of  harami called a harami cross. 
A  harami  cross  has  a  doji  for  the  second  day  of  the  harami  pattern 
instead  of  a  small  real  body.  The  harami  cross,  because  it  contains  a 
potent doji (more about doji in Chapter 8), is viewed as a major reversal 
signal. The harami cross is sometimes referred to as the petrifying pattern. 
As illustrated in Exhibit 6.1,  the color of  the second session is unim- 
portant.  The  decisive feature  of  this  pattern  is  that  the  second  session 
has  a  minute  real  body  relative  to  the  prior  candlestick  and  that  this

small real body is inside the larger one. The size of  the shadows are usu- 
ally not important in either a harami or harami cross. 

The  harami  displays  a  disparity  about  the  market's  health.  After  a 
bull  move,  the  long  white  real  body's  vitality  is  followed by  the  small 
real  body's  uncertainty.  This shows  the  bulls'  upward  drive  has  weak- 
ened. Thus a trend  reversal is possible. During a bear move,  the heavy 
selling pressure  reflected by  a long,  black  real  body  is followed by  the 
second  day's  vacillation. This could  portend  a  trend  reversal  since  the 
second day's  small real body is an alert that the bears'  power has dimin- 
ished.

called  its  end  and  the  selloff  that  started  with  harami 1 stopped  with 
harami 2.  Harami 3 reflects how a harami pattern might be  useful even 
if  there  is  no  evident  trend  before  a  harami  pattern  occurs.  Note  that 
there  was  no  evident  trend  during  the  first  few  days  of  May.  Then 
harami 3 arose with its long,  white real body followed by a small, black 
real  body  (remember  the  color  of  the  second  day's  real  body  is  not 
important). 

A trader could, nonetheless, use this pattern as a signal that the rally 

More Reversal  Formations  83 

started  on  the  strong,  white  day  had  failed. The  market  was now at a 
point of  indecision. A buy would  not be recommended until the indeci- 
sion had been resolved via a close above the highs of  harami 3. 

Harami 4 was a classic. An uptrend was evident prior to the tall white 
candlestick. The  next day's  small real body  completed  the harami. This 
small real body also took on the negative aspects of  a shooting star day 
(although not a perfect star since the real body was not above the prior 
real body). 

Exhibit 6.5 illustrates exemplary harami. Each of  the second day's  real 
bodies are diminutive  compared  to the  prior long  real  bodies.  The first 
harami implied a lack of  upside momentum;  the second  harami implied 
a drying up of  selling pressure. 

Exhibit 6.6 illustrates  how the two candlestick harami  pattern in late 
March spelled the top of  the market. The selloff continued until the bull- 
ish hammer occurred on April 24.  Notice how the shadow of  the second 
session in the harami was outside the real body of  the prior session. This 
demonstrates the importance of  the relationship between the real bodies 
and not the shadows. 

Exhibit  6.7  shows  a  steep  decline  which  ensued  from  the  bearish 
engulfing  pattern of  May 7 and 8.  This harami marked  the change of  a 
downtrend into a lateral band. 

Intra-day  traders could use the harami in Exhibit 6.8 as a signal that 
the prior intra-day trend might be over.  Appropriate action would  then 
be  warranted.  In  this  example,  the  early  April  17  precipitous  price 
decline ended and  the market went into a lull after the harami pattern. 
This  harami could  have been  used  by day traders  to cover shorts.  Like

any bottom reversal pattern, this harami did not preclude the possibility 
that  the  market  would  resume  its  downward  course.  Yet,  this  harami 
relayed a condition about the market. Specifically, it told us that, at least 
at the time of  the harami,  the downward pressure had subsided. 

Exhibit 6.9 is  a good example of  a  precipitous downtrend converted 
to a lateral trading environment after the advent  of  the harami. In  this 
example  we  see  how  the  prior  downtrend,  in  which  prices  cascaded 
from $5.40 to $4.85,  stopped at the harami. But the harami did not nec- 
essarily  imply  a  rally.  After  a  harami  the  market  usually  eases  into  a 
congestion band. 

Harami Cross 

The regular harami has a tall real body followed by a smaller real body. 
Yet,  there are  no  rules  as  to  what  is  considered  a "small" candlestick. 
This,  like  many  other  charting  techniques,  is  subjective.  As  a  general 
principle, the smaller the second real body, the more potent the pattern. 
This is  usually  true  because  the  smaller  the  real body,  the  greater  the 
ambivalence and the more likely a trend reversal. In the extreme, as the

real body becomes increasingly smaller as the spread between the open 
and close narrows, a doji is formed. 

As mentioned,  a doji preceded by a long real body is called a harami 
cross.  The  harami cross  carries  more  significance than  a  regular  harami 
pattern.  Where  the  harami  is  not  a  major  reversal pattern,  the  harami 
cross is  a  major  reversal pattern.  A  harami  cross occurring after a  very 
long white candlestick is a pattern a long trader ignores at his own peril. 
Harami crosses also call bottoms, but they are more effective at tops. 

Exhibit 6.10 illustrates how the rally from mid-March abruptly ended 
when  the  harami  cross  pattern  formed  on  April  2 and  3.  Exhibit  6.11 
shows  how  the  large  upside  gap  made  in  mid-January shouted,  "bull 
market." But,  the harami cross said, "no bull market now." Exhibit 6.12 
shows  how  an  unusually  large black candlestick session  followed  by  a 
doji created a harami cross. It  shows how the market had severed  itself 
from  the  prior  downtrend.  A  hammerlike session  after  the  doji  of  the 
harami cross (that successfully tested the recent lows) gave further proof 
of  a bottom.

The Basics 

TWEEZERS TOPS AND BOTTOMS 

Tweezers are two or more candlestick lines with matching highs or lows. 
They are called  tweezers because they are  compared  to the  two prongs 
of  a tweezers. In a rising market, a tweezers top is formed when the highs 
match. In a falling market,  a tweezers  bottom is made when the lows are 
the  same.  The  tweezers  could  be  composed  of  real  bodies,  shadows, 
and/or doji. A tweezers occurs on nearby or consecutive sessions and as 
such  are  usually  not  a  vital  reversal  signal.  They  take  on extra  impor- 
tance when they occur after an extended move or contain other bearish 
(for a top reversal) or a bullish (for a bottom reversal) candlestick signals. 
Exhibits 6.13 through 6.18 elaborate on this idea. 

Exhibit 6.13 shows how, in an uptrend, a long white line is followed 
by  a  doji.  This  two-candlestick pattern,  a  harami  cross  with  the  same 
high, can be a significant reversal signal.  Exhibit 6.14 illustrates a twee- 
zers  top  formed  by  a  long  white  candlestick  and  a  hanging-man  line 
during the  next  session. If  the  market  opens under  the  hanging-man's 
real  body,  odds  are  strong  that  a  top  has  been  reached.  The  market 
should not close above the tweezers top in order for this bearish view to 
prevail. This two-line mixture can also be considered a harami. As such, 
it would be a top reversal pattern  during an uptrend. Exhibit 6.15 illus- 
trates a  tweezers  top  joined with  the second  period's  bearish  shooting- 
star  line.  Although  not  a  true shooting  star,  the  second  line is  bearish 
based  on  the  price  action  which  creates  it;  the  market  opens  near  its

lows,  rallies to the prior  session's  high,  then closes  near its low for  the 
session. This would also be considered a harami pattern. 

Exhibit 6.16 illustrates a variation on the dark-cloud cover. Here,  the 
second day opens above the prior day's  close (instead of  above the prior 
day's  high). The black candlestick day's  high  touches  the prior  period's 
high  and  then  falls. This could  be  viewed  as  a  combination  of  a  dark- 
cloud  cover  and  a  tweezers  top.  Exhibit 6.17 shows  a  hammer  session 
which  successfully  tests  the  prior  long  black  candlestick's  lows.  The 
hammer,  and  the successful test  of  support,  proves  that  the sellers are 
losing  control  of  the  market.  This  two-line  combination  can  also  be 
viewed as a harami. This would be another reason to view this action as 
important support. Exhibit 6.18 is a variation on the bullish piercing line 
with a tweezers bottom added in for good measure. A true piercing line 
would open under the prior  day's  low.  Here it  opened  under  the  prior 
day's  close. 

These examples of  tweezers are not inclusive. They are representative 
of  how  top and bottom tweezers should  be confirmed by  other  candle- 
stick  indications  so  as  to  be  valuable  forecasting  tools.  For  those  who 
want  a  longer  time  perspective,  tweezers  tops  and  bottoms  on  the 
weekly and monthly candlestick charts made by consecutive candlesticks 
could be important  reversal  patterns.  This  would  be  true even  without 
other  candlestick confirmation because,  on  a  weekly or  monthly  chart, 
for example, a low made the preceding session that is successfully tested 
this session could be an important base for  a rally. Less important, and 
less likely to be a base for a rally,  would be, on a daily chart, a low made 
yesterday that is successfully tested  today. 

Exhibit 6.19  illustrates  tweezer  tops  and  bottoms.  The  tweezers  top 
was confirmed when the second day completed a bearish engulfing  pat- 
tern.  Tweezers  bottom  pattern 1 illustrates  a  star.  Note  also  how  this 
two-day  tweezer  bottom  was  a  successful  test  of  the  piercing  pattern 
from the  prior week.  Tweezers bottom 2 is a set  of  two  hammers. The 
combination of  these  two  bullish indications,  the  tweezers  bottom  and 
the hammers, set the stage for a rally. 

Exhibit 6.20 shows that the lows made on January 24,  near $.95, were 
retested a week later. The test was not only successful, but this test built 
a bullish engulfing pattern. Exhibit 6.21 shows that on February 14 and 
15,  a two-day  tweezers bottom also established  a bullish engulfing  pat- 
tern. Exhibit 6.22 illustrates  a hanging man following a long white can- 
dlestick. The highs on both of  these weeks (as well as the next) were the 
same,  thus creating a tweezers  top. The two lines of  the tweezers were 
also a harami pattern.  Exhibit 6.23 shows that a variation of  an evening 
star  developed  in  late  June. For  a  true  evening  star,  we  like  to  see  a 
longer white candlestick as the first line in the pattern. Nonetheless, this 

90  The Basics 

became  a  resistance  area  as  proved  by  the  following  week's  hanging 
man. The hanging man touched  the prior week's highs and failed. This 
created a tweezers top. 

At  the August 1987 peaks,  as shown in Exhibit 6.24,  the S&P's long 
white candlestick followed by a doji formed a tweezers top which acted 
as resistance the next week. Besides the tweezers top, a doji after a long 
white candlestick at  high  price levels is  dangerous.  This feature is dis- 
cussed in detail in Chapter 8.

BELT-HOLD LINES 

The belt hold is an individual candlestick line which can  be either bull- 
ish  or  bearish.  The  bullish  belt  hold  is  a  strong  white  candlestick  which 
opens on the low  of  the  day  (or with a  very  small lower  shadow) and 
moves  higher  for the  rest  of  the  day.  The  bullish  belt-hold  line  is  also 
called a white opening  shaven bottom. If, as in Exhibit 6.25,  the market is at 
a low price area and a long bullish belt hold appears, it forecasts a rally. 
The bearish belt hold  (see Exhibit 6.26) is a long black candlestick which 
opens on the high of the session  (or within a few ticks of  the high) and 
continues lower through the session.  If  prices are high,  the appearance 
of  a  bearish  belt  hold  is  a  top  reversal.  The  bearish  belt-hold  line  is 
sometimes called a black  opening  shaven head.

EXHIBIT 6.26.  Bearish Belt Hold 

The longer the height of  the belt-hold candlestick line,  the more sig- 
nificant it becomes. Belt-hold lines are also more important  if  they have 
not appeared  for a while.  The actual Japanese name for  the belt hold  is 
a sumo wrestling term: yorikiri. It means "pushing your opponent out of 
the ring while holding onto his belt." A close above a black bearish belt- 
hold line should  mean a resumption of  the uptrend. A  close under the 
white bullish belt-hold line implies a renewal of  selling pressure. 

Exhibit 6.27 shows how bullish belt-hold line 1 signaled a rally. Belt- 
hold line 2 is interesting.  It confirmed a  tweezers  bottom since it  main- 
tained the prior week's lows. A rally ensued which ended with a harami 
a few weeks later.

EXHIBIT 6.28.  Cotton-December 1990,  Daily (Bearish Belt Hold) 

The  shooting  star  was  the first  sign  of  trouble in  Exhibit  6.28.  The 
next  session's  bearish  belt-hold  line  confirmed a  top.  Another  bearish 
belt hold  during  the following week reflected the underlying  weakness 
of  the market. 

Exhibit 6.29 is an example of  back-to-back bearish belt  holds in mid- 
February.  The  selloff  which  ensued,  was  sharp,  but  brief  as  a  bullish 
morning star  pattern spelled a bottom.

The Basics 

UPSIDE-GAP TWO CROWS 

An upside-gap two crows (what a mouthful) is illustrated in Exhibit 6.30. 
The upside gap refers to the gap between the real body of  the small black 
real  body and  the real  body  preceding it  (the real  body  which  precedes 
the  first  black  candlestick  is  usually  a  long  white  one). The  two  black 
candlesticks are the "crows" in this pattern. They are analogous to black 
crows  peering  ominously  down from  a  tree  branch. Based  on  this  por- 
tentous  comparison,  it is  obviously  a  bearish  pattern.  An  ideal  upside- 
gap  two crows  has  the second  black  real  body  opening  above  the  first 
black  real  body's  open.  It  then closes  under  the first  black  candlestick's 
close. 

The rationale for  the bearish  aspect of  this pattern is as follows: The 
market is in an uptrend and opens higher on an opening gap. The new 
highs fail to hold and the market forms a black candlestick. But the bulls 
can take some succor, at least, because the close on this black candlestick 
session still holds above the prior day's close. The third session paints a 
more bearish  portrait with another new high and another failure  to hold 
these  highs into the close.  More  negative,  however,  is  that this session 
closes under the prior day's close. If  the market is so strong, why did the 
new  highs fail  to  hold  and  why  did  the  market  close lower? Those  are 
the questions  that  the  bulls  are  probably  nervously  asking  themselves. 
The  answers  might  be  that  the  market  may  not  be  as  strong  as  they 
would  like.  If  the  next  day  (that  is,  the  fourth  session)  prices  fail  to 
regain high ground,  then expect lower  prices. 

There  is  a  related  pattern  that  looks  something  like  an  upside-gap 
two crows.  Unlike  the  upside-gap  two  crows,  it  is  a  bullish  in  a  rising 
market. As such,  it is  one of  the few  candlestick continuation  patterns. 
(Other continuation  patterns  are  discussed  in  Chapter  7.) It  is  called  a 
mat-hold  pattern  (see Exhibit 6.31). This  pattern  occurs  in  a  bull  market 
and  is  a  bullish  continuation  pattern.  The  first  three  candlesticks  are 
similar  to  the  upside-gap  two  crows  but  another  black  candlestick  fol- 
lows. If  the next candlestick is white and gaps above  the last black can-

dlestick's  upper shadow or closes above the last black candlestick's high, 
then buying is warranted. This pattern can have two, three, or four black 
candlesticks. The upside gap two crows and the mat-hold are relatively 
rare. 

Exhibit 6.32 is a good example of  this type of  upside-gap  two crows 
pattern.  In early February,  the two crows flew above a long white can- 
dlestick.  This  pattern  called  an  end  to  the  rally  which  had  begun  a 
month earlier. 

In  Exhibit  6.33,  one  can  see  that  on  November 27,  copper  pushed 
ahead via a long white session. New highs on the two following sessions 
failed  to  hold.  The  second  black  candlestick session  made  this  into  an 
upside-gap  two  crows  pattern.  The  market  slid  until  a  doji  star  and  a 
tweezers bottom built a platform for another leg higher. 

Exhibit 6.34 is a classic example of  the rare mat-hold pattern. A strong 
white  candle  followed  by  a  black  candlestick  that  gaped  higher.  Two 
more small black candlesticks followed with  the white candlestick com- 
pleting the mat-hold pattern.  Note how this pattern is not too much dif- 
ferent from the upside-gap  two crows (remember the mat hold can also 
have  two,  instead  of  three,  small  black  candlesticks just as  the  upside-

gap two crows has). The main difference is the appearance  of  the white 
candlestick  at  the  end  which  turns  the  pattern  bullish.  Thus,  for  an 
upside-gap  two crows,  I suggest you  place a stop on a  close above  the 
second  black candlestick's  high. 

THREE BLACK  CROWS 

The upside-gap two crows consists of  two black candlesticks. If  there are 
three declining consecutive black candlesticks it is called three black crows 
pattern (see Exhibit 6.35). The three black crows presage lower  prices if 
they appear at  high-price  levels or  after a mature advance. Three crows 
are  also  sometimes  called  three-winged  crows.  The  Japanese  have  an 
expression, "bad news has wings." This is an appropriate saying for  the 
three-winged  crow  pattern. The  three  crows  are,  as the  name implies, 
three black candlesticks. Likened to the image of  a group of  crows sitting 
ominously in a tall dead tree, the three crows have bearish implications. 
The three lines should close at, or near, their lows. Each of  the openings 
should  also  be  within  the  prior  session's  real  body.  The analyst  would 
also like  to see  the real body  of  the first  candlestick  of  the three crows 
under the prior white session's high. 

Exhibit 6.36 is a good example of  a three crows pattern. In mid-June, 
three  black  crows  appeared.  Another  three  crow  pattern  shows  up  a 
month later in mid July. July's three crows also was a failure at the highs 
from June's three crows near the 33,000 level. This formed a double top. 
Exhibit 6.37 is another  example of  this  pattern. June 15 was the first of 
the three crows. An interesting aspect about these three crows is that the 
open of  the second and third black candlesticks are at,  or very near,  the 
close  of  the  prior  black candlestick.  This is  referred  to  as  identical  three 
crows. It is regarded as especially bearish, but it is a  very rare  pattern.

EXHIBIT 6.38.  Bullish Counterattack Line 

COUNTERATTACK LINES 

Counterattack lines are formed when opposite colored candlesticks have 
the same close. The best way to describe this pattern is by discussing the 
illustrations  in  Exhibits  6.38  and  6.39.  Exhibit  6.38  is  an  example  of  a 
bullish  counterattack  line.  This  pattern  occurs  during  a  decline.  The  first 
candlestick  of  this  pattern  is  long  and  black.  The  next  session  opens 
sharply  lower.  At  this  point,  the  bears are  feeling confident.  The  bulls 
then stage their counterattack as they push prices back up to unchanged 
from the prior close. The prior downtrend has then been bridled. 

The bullish counterattack is comparable to the bullish piercing line. If 
you  remember,  the piercing line has  the same  two-candlestick configu- 
ration as that shown for the bullish counterattack pattern. The main dif- 
ference is that the bullish counterattack line does not usually move into 
the prior session's white real body. It just gets back to the prior session's 
close. The piercing pattern's  second line pushes well into the black real 
body.  Consequently,  the  piercing  pattern  is  a  more  significant  bottom 
reversal than is this bullish counterattack line. Nonetheless, as shown in 
the  bullish  counterattack  line  should  be 
some  examples  below, 
respected. 

The bullish counterattack line also looks similar to the bearish in-neck 
pattern  (see Chapter  4,  Exhibit  4.31). The  difference  is  that  the  white 
bullish counterattack line is a longer candlestick  than the white candle- 
stick of  the in-neck line. In other words, with the counterattack line, the 
market opens sharply lower and then springs back to the previous close, 
while the in-neck line opens slightly lower and then moves back  to  the 
prior close. 

Exhibit 6.39 illustrates the bearish counterattack  line.  It is a top reversal 
pattern in that it should stall the prior rally. The first candlestick, a long 
white one, keeps the bullish momentum going. The next session's open- 
ing gaps higher. Then the bears come out fighting and pull prices down

to the prior day's  close. The bulls'  tide of  optimism on the second day's 
opening probably turned to apprehension by the close. 

As the bullish counterattack line is related to the piercing line, so the 
bearish counterattack line is related to the dark-cloud cover. The bearish 
counter  attack,  like  the  dark-cloud  cover,  opens above  the  prior  day's 
high. Unlike the dark-cloud cover, though, the close does not go into the 
prior day's  white candlestick. Thus,  the dark-cloud cover sends a stron- 
ger top reversal signal than does the bearish counterattack line. 

An important consideration of  these counterattack lines is if  the sec- 
ond  session  should  open  robustly  higher  (in  the  case  of  the  bearish 
counterattack) or  sharply lower (for the bullish counterattack). The idea 
is that on the opening of  the second day of  this pattern, the market has 
moved strongly in the direction of  the original trend. Then, surprise! By 
the close, it moves back to unchanged from the prior 'session! 

On May 29,  in Exhibit 6.40,  the long white candlestick reinforced the 
bullish outlook from a rally that started the prior week. Sure enough, on 
May  30,  the  market  surged  ahead  on  the  opening.  However,  it  was 
downhill from there for the rest of  the session.  By  the close,  the market 
had fallen back  to unchanged from the prior close. These two sessions, 
May 29  and 30,  constructed a bearish counterattack pattern. 

Exhibit 6.41 shows that a rally terminated with the bearish counterat- 
tack line. Exhibit 6.42 shows that  the  price waterfall, which began  with 
the bearish engulfing line in  March 1989,  ended  with  the bullish coun- 
terattack  a  few  months  later.  Remember,  all  trend  reversal indicators, 
like  the counterattack line,  tells you is  that  the trend  will change. That 
does not mean prices will reverse direction. Here is an example of  how 
a bullish reversal pattern signaled that the prior downtrend was over as 
the trend  went  from down  to sideways.  This example  also shows  that 
the closes do not have to be identical in order to make the pattern valid. 
In  Exhibit  6.43 one  can  see  how  prices  eroded  from  the  shooting  star 
until  the  bullish  counterattack  line  appeared.  Another  positive feature 
about  this  bullish  counterattack  line  is  that  it  was  a  session  which

opened under the late July, early August support area but,  nonetheless, 
the new lows could not be maintained. This showed that the bears could 
not take control of  the market. 

THREE MOUNTAINS AND THREE  RIVERS 

There are  a  group  of  longer-term topping and  bottoming  patterns that 
include  the  three  mountains,  the  three  rivers,  the  three  Buddha  tops, 
inverted three Buddha, dumpling tops, fry pan bottoms, and tower tops 
and bottoms. Similar to the Western triple top,  the Japanese have a three 
mountain top (see Exhibit 6.44). It is supposed to represent a major top. If 
the market backs off  from a high three times or makes three attempts at 
a  high,  it is  deemed  a  three  mountain  top.  The  high  point  of  the final 
mountain should be confirmed with a bearish candlestick indicator  (for 
example, a doji or dark-cloud cover). 

If  the central mountain of  a three mountain top is the highest moun- 
tain it is a special  type  of three  mountain called  a three  Buddha  top  (see 
Exhibit 6.45). The reason for  this name is because, in Buddhist temples, 
there is a large central Buddha with smaller Buddhas (that is,  saints) on 
both  sides.  This is  a  perfect  analogy  to  a  head  and  shoulders  pattern. 
Although  the three Buddha  top is an analogy to  the Western head and 
shoulders pattern,  the theory about  the Japanese three Buddha  pattern 
was  used  over  a  hundred  years  before  the  head  and  shoulders  was 
known in  America.  (The earliest I have seen a  reference to a  head  and 
shoulders pattern in the United States was by Richard Schabacker in the 
1930s.  For  those who are  familiar with  the Edwards  and  Magee  classic

book Technical  Analysis of  Stock Trends, much of  the material in that book 
is based on Schabacker's  work. Schabacker was Edward's  father-in-law.) 
It  is intriguing  how  market  observers  from  both  the West  and  the East 
have come up with the this same pattern. Market psychology is the same 
the  world  'round,  or,  as a Japanese proverb  expresses,  "The  tone  of  a 
bird's  song is the same everywhere." 

The three  river  bottom  pattern  (see Exhibit  6.46) is  the  opposite  of  the 
three  mountain  top.  This  occurs when  the  market  tests  a  bottom  level 
three  times.  The  peak  of  the  troughs  should  be  exceeded  to  confirm  a 
bottom. The equivalent of  the Western head and shoulders bottom (also 
called an inverted  head  and shoulders) is called the modified  three river bottom 
pattern  or the inverted  three  Buddha  pattern  (see Exhibit 6.47). 

Exhibit 6.48 is an unusual chart in that it  has  the various  manifesta- 

tions of  the three mountain top. They are as follows: 

1. Areas 1, 2, and 3 construct a three Buddha pattern because the central 
mountain is the highest of  the three peaks. The top of  the third moun- 
tain  was an evening star line.  The  selloff  which  originated with  the 
third mountain concludes at June's morning star pattern. 

2.  Three  price  peaks  occur at  A,  B,  and  C. Some  Japanese technicians 
view  the  three  mountain  as  three attempts  at  new  highs,  like  three 
waves up. The third  wave up is supposed to be a crest  (the scenario 
in this instance). Three pushes to new highs and after the third failed 
push, the bulls surrender. The peak of  the third mountain (c) was an 
evening star. 

3.  While some Japanese technicians  view a three-stage  rise as the three 
mountains, others view the three mountains as repeating tests of  the 
same price peaks. This is what develops at areas C,  D, and E. Area D 
signals  a  top  via  a  dark-cloud  cover;  E signals  with  a  hanging  man 
followed by a doji. 

Each of  the three mountains in Exhibit 6.49 illustrate  bearish  candle- 
stick evidence.  Area 1 is a bearish engulfing pattern, area 2 is a hanging

man followed by  two doji,  and area 3 is another  bearish engulfing  pat- 
tern. Since the central mountain formed the highest peak in Exhibit 6.50, 
this pattern became a three Buddha  pattern. The black real body within 
the prior white real body formed a harami at the peak of  the high central 
mountain. 

As  illustrated  in  Exhibit  6.51,  there  was  an  inverted  three  Buddha 
pattern in 1988 (that is,  similar to an inverted head and shoulders). Each 
of  these bottoms at A,  B,  and C had a bullish candlestick indication.  At 
A,  a hammer appeared.  At B,  another  hammer  appeared  that was  part 
of  a  morning star  pattern  (the morning star  rally ended  with  the  dark- 
cloud  cover).  At  C,  a  piercing  line  appeared  (it was  almost  a  bullish 
engulfing pattern). Once the bulls gapped above the downward sloping 
resistance line, the trend turned up. Gaps are called windows by Japanese 
technicians. (Windows will be discussed at length in the next chapter on 
continuation patterns.) Because I refer to gaps in this chapter,  the reader 
should note that the Japanese view gaps (that is,  windows) as continua- 
tion patterns. Thus a gap higher is bullish and a gap lower is bearish. In 
this example,  the gap higher had bullish implications. The price activity 
from  the  third  quarter  of  1989  into  the  first  quarter  of  1990  effected  a 
three Buddha top. 

In order for the three river bottoms (including this one) to provide a 
buy  signal,  there  should  be  a  close  via  a  white  candlestick above  the 
peaks  of  the  troughs (see Exhibit 6.52). In  this  case,  it  would  be above

THE  IMPORTANCE OF THE  NUMBER THREE 
IN CANDLESTICK ANALYSIS 

The emphasis on  triple tops and bottoms by  the Japanese probably has 
to do with  the importance of  the number three in  the Japanese culture. 
We,  as Westerners, would not necessarily see anything special about the 
three peaks. Our view would be that double tops and, more rarely, tops 
which  have  been  tested  four  times  can  be  just  as  significant  as  triple 
tops. But the Japanese think differently. And maybe they can show us a 
side  of  Western analysis which we  may  have  overlooked. Intriguingly, 
there  are  many  pattern  and  technical  concepts  based  on  the  number 
three in Western technical analysis as well as in candlestick charting. The 
following is  a  quote  from  John Murphy's  book  Technical  Analysis  of  the 
Futures  Markets: 

It's interesting to note how often the number three shows up in the study 
of  technical analysis and the important role it plays in so many technical 
approaches.  For  example,  the fan  principle  uses  three  lines;  major  bull 
and bear markets have three  phases  (Dow theory and Elliott Wave The- 
ory); there are  three kinds of  gaps some  of  the more commonly known 
reversal patterns, such as the triple top and the head and shoulders, have 
three  prominent  peaks;  there  are  three  different  classifications of  trend 
(major, secondary, and minor) and three trend directions (up, down, and 
sideways); among the generally accepted continuation patterns,  there are 
three  types  of  triangles-the symmetrical,  ascending,  and  descending; 
there are three principle sources of  information-price, volume and open 
interest. For whatever  the reason,  the number  three plays a very promi- 
nent role throughout  the entire field of  technical analysis.' 

John Murphy  was,  of  course referring to Western technical analysis. 
But his phrase, "the number three plays a very prominent role" is espe- 
cially  true  of  Japanese candlestick  analysis.  In  pre-modern  Japan,  the 
number  three  had  an  almost  mystical  associations.  There  is  a  saying 
"three times lucky" that expresses this belief. Parenthetically, while the 
number  three  is  regarded  as  lucky,  the  number  four  is  viewed  as  a 
foreboding figure. The reason for this belief  is easy to ascertain-in Jap- 
anese the pronunciation for the number four and the word death are the 
same. 

Some specifics of  the frequency of  three in candlestick charting are as 
follows: There are the three white soldiers that presage a rally; the omi- 

More Reversal  Formations  113 

nous three black crows that portend a price fall; top patterns include the 
three mountain top and its variation; the three Buddha pattern; the three 
river bottoms; the three windows (see Chapter 7) which define the extent 
of  a move; the three methods (see Chapter 7); and the three candlestick 
patterns  including  the  morning  and  evening  stars.  The  Japanese  also 
believe  that  if  a  window  (during a  rising  market) is  not  closed  within 
three days the market will rally. 

DUMPLING TOPS AND FRY PAN BOTTOMS 

The  dumpling  top  (see Exhibit 6.53) usually has small real bodies  as  the 
market forms a convex pattern. When the market gaps down, confirma- 
tion of  a dumpling top occurs. This pattern is  the same as  the Western 
rounded  bottom  top.  The  dumpling top  should  have  a  downside  win- 
dow as proof  of  a top. 

The fry pan bottom (see Exhibit 6.54) reflects a market which is bottom- 
ing and whose price action forms a concave design and then a window 
to the upside opens. It has the same appearance  as a Western rounded 
bottom,  but  the Japanese fry  pan  bottom should  have a  window  in  an 
upmove in order to confirm the bottom. 

The rounding top and the small real bodies as the market tops out is 
indicative of  dumpling  top  as  seen  in  Exhibit  6.55.  Note  how  the  doji 
was  at  the  peak  of  the  market  with  the  downside  window  helping  to 
confirm the dumpling top pattern. The fact the black candlestick after the 
window was a black belt-hold line was another reason for a bearish out- 
look. Exhibit 6.56 shows a fry pan bottom whose low points on April 27 
and 28  formed a harami  pattern.  A window in early May  substantiated 
that a fry pan bottom had been put into place. 

Exhibit  6.57 illustrates  a  nicely  shaped  fry  pan  bottom.  The  bullish 
confirmation came at candlestick 2. Although the market did not form a 
and 2,  the fact  that  the high  for  candle- 
window between candlestick 1 
for candlestick 2 was $997 meant it only 
stick 1 was $1,000 and the low

TOWER TOPS AND TOWER  BOTTOMS 

The tower top is a top reversal pattern. It occurs while the market is in an 
uptrend and then a strong white candlestick (or a series of  white candle- 
sticks) appears. The market's  rise then slows and the highs start falling. 
The  tower  top is  completed  with  the  appearance  of  one  or  more large 
black  candlesticks  (see  Exhibit  6.58).  This  pattern's  long  candlesticks 
resemble tall towers-hence the name. 

I 

' 

EXHIBIT 6.58.  Tower Top

The Basics 

The tower bottom develops at low price levels. After one or more long 
black  candlesticks  there  is  a  short-term  lull.  Then  one  or  more  large 
white  candlesticks emerge.  This  creates  a  bottom  with  towers  on  both 
sides (see Exhibit 6.59). That is,  long candlesticks on the way down and 
long candlesticks on the way up. 

Exhibit  6.60  shows  that  a  group  of  strong  white  candlesticks 
appeared  from  first  quarter  until  the  second  quarter  of  1987.  Then  a 
series of  long black candlesticks surfaced. The tall white candles formed 
the left tower while the long black ones the right tower. The three black 
candlesticks were also three black crows.

bottom. First,  I  will review the tower bottom. A long black candlestick on 
August 28,  some sideways action via  narrow candlesticks, and the long 
white  candlestick September  7 created a  tower  bottom.  The steep  price 
descent  on August 28  erected the left  tower and the sharp rally,  which 
commenced September  7,  erected the right tower.  Notice the three can- 
dlesticks numbered 1,  2,  and 3 on August 28  through August 30. These 
comprise the extremely rare unique three river bottom (see Exhibit 6.62). 
Its closest relative in candlesticks is the evening star pattern. The unique 
three  river  bottom  is  a  bottom  reversal  pattern.  Its  first  line  is  an

extended  black  candlestick, the second  line is a black real body  candle- 
stick  that  closes  higher  than  the  first  candlestick's  close,  and  the  third 
line is a very small real body white candlestick. This last line displays a 
market whose selling pressure has dried up. 

The closest analogy in Western technical terms to the tower reversals 
would be the spike,  or V,  reversals.  In the spike  reversal,  the  market is 
in a strong trend and then abruptly reverses  to a new trend. The tower 
top and bottom are similar to the dumpling top and the fry pan bottom. 
The  major  differences are  that  the  towers  have  long  real bodies  before 
and  after  the  market  turns and  the  dumpling  top  and  fry  pan  bottom 
have windows. The towers  usually also have  more volatile candlesticks 
than the dumpling tops or fry pan bottoms. Do not worry about whether 
a top is a tower top of  a dumpling top, or if  a bottom is a tower bottom, 
or a fry pan. All these patterns are viewed as major reversal patterns.

"Fate Aids  the Courageous" 

M o s t  candlestick  signals  are  trend  reversals.  There  are,  however,  a 
group of  candlestick patterns which are continuation indicators.  As the 
Japanese express it,  "there are  times to buy,  times to sell,  and times to 
rest." Many of  these patterns imply a time of  rest, a breather, before the 
market resumes its prior trend. The continuation formations reviewed in 
this  chapter  are  windows  (and  patterns  which  include  windows), the 
rising and falling three methods,  and the three white soldiers. 

WINDOWS 

As discussed earlier, the Japanese commonly refer to a gap as a window. 
Whereas  the  Western  expression  is  "filling  in  the  gap",  the  Japanese 
would say "closing the window." In this section I will explain the basic 
concepts of  windows  and  then  explore  other  patterns containing  win- 
dows  (gaps). These include  the  tasuki gaps,  the gapping  plays,  and side- 
by-side white lines. 

A window is a gap between the prior and the current session's  price 
extremes. Exhibit 7.1 shows an open window that forms in an uptrend. 
There is a gap between the prior upper shadow and this session's  lower 
shadow. A window in a downtrend is displayed in Exhibit 7.2. It shows 
no price activity between the previous day's  lower shadow and the cur-

rent day's  upper shadow. It is said by Japanese technicians to go in the 
direction of  the window. Windows also become support and resistance 
areas. Thus a window in a rally implies a further price rise. This window 
should  also  be  a floor  on  pullbacks. If  the  pullback closes  the  window 
and selling pressure continues after the closing of  this window, the prior 
uptrend is voided. Likewise, a window in a declining price environment 
implies still lower levels. Any price rebounds should run into resistance 
at  this  window.  If  the  window  is  closed,  and  the  rally  that  closed  the 
window persists, the downtrend is done. 

Traditional Japanese technical analysis  (that is,  candlesticks) asserts 
that corrections go back to the window. In other words, a test of  an open 
window is likely. Thus, in an uptrend one can use pullbacks to the win- 
dow as a buying zone.  Longs should  be  vacated and even shorts could 
be considered if  the selling pressure  continues after the window closes. 
The  opposite  strategy  would  be  warranted  with  a  window in  a  down- 
trend. 

We  see windows 1 and 2 in Exhibit 7.3 amid a rally which originated 
with  the  bullish engulfing  pattern.  A  bearish  shooting  star  arose  after 
window  2.  The  day  after  this  shooting  star,  the  market  opened  lower 
and closed the window (that is, filled in the gap). Remembering the con- 
cept that corrections go back to the window,  this pullback to the window 
should  not  be a surprise.  If  the window is  closed and  the selling  pres- 
sure were to continue, the end of  the uptrend would be flagged. This did 
not  happen.  The  selling  force  evaporated  once  the  window  closed.  In 
addition, the support set up at window 1 held. During the week of  Feb- 
ruary 20  the market shuffled its feet. It then retested support at window 
2. After this successful test,  the market pushed ahead and opened win- 
dow 3. This was a significant window because it represented a gap above 
the $1.10  resistance level. This  old  $1.10  resistance area,  once  broken,

should become support. Add to this the support at the window near this 
$1.10  area and you have  two reasons to expect $1.10 to  provide a solid 
floor. Throughout March, this area did indeed provide a firm footing for 
the bulls. 

The  Japanese believe  windows  from  a  congestion  zone,  or  from  a 
new  high,  deserve  special  attention.  See  Exhibit  7.4.  The  early  March 
window above $.I5 was a significant break above a month-long conges- 
tion  zone. Thus there  was dual support in  the window  near  $.15. The 
first was because of  the window,  the second was because the old resis- 
tance area  had  become  support.  Notice the solid  support  this  window 
provided  for  the  next few  months.  April 2 and  3  comprised a  harami. 
This indicates that  the  prior  trend  (in this  case,  a  downtrend) had  run 
out  of  steam.  A bullish engulfing  pattern  formed a  few  days  later.  On 
April 16 an inverted hammer appeared. Each of  these patterns appeared 
near the window's  support at $.15. 

In  March  1988,  a  bullish  engulfing  pattern  presaged  a  rally.  (See 
Exhibit  7.5.) A window  opened  during  the  rally.  The  rally  progressed 
until the bearish counter attack line. The window held as support for five 
weeks  but  the  persistence of  selling  after  the  window  closed  annulled 
the uptrend.

EXHIBIT 7.6.  International Paper-Daily 1990 (Window from a Low 
Price Congestion  Area) 

Thus far, the focus of  this section has been on the use of  the window 
as  support  or  resistance  and  as  a  continuation  indication.  There  is 
another  use. (See Exhibit 7.6.) A  window,  especially if  it is made with a 
small  black  candlestick  from  a  low  price  congestion  area,  can  mean  a 
meaningful  upside  breakout.  Exhibit  7.6  illustrates  this  principle. 
Throughout February prices were locked in a relatively tight  congestion 
band. Between February 24 and 25,  a small upside  window opened  via 
a diminutive  black candlestick. This window was confirmed as support 
the next session. On that session (February 26), the market not only held 
the window as a support but produced the strongest type of  candlestick 
line,  a  long  white  candlestick that  opens  on  its  low  (that is,  a  bullish 
belt-hold line) and closes on its high. 

A large window appeared in mid-January as indicated by Exhibit 7.7. 
From late January to late February, there were  numerous return moves 
to this window (corrections go back to the window). Each of  these rallies 
was short circuited when they got near the resistance level created by the 
window. 

Look at the Dow in Exhibit 7.8. The "Crash of  '87" created a window 
in the 2,150 to 2,200 zone. Two criteria were needed to tell us the down- 
trend was over. The first was to close the large window. The second was 
for  a  continuation  of  the  buying  force  once  the  window closed.  These 
criteria were met in early 1989. 

Exhibit 7.9 is another example of  a window creating  resistance.  The 

124 

The Basics

EXHIBIT 7.7.  Eurodollar-June 1990,  Daily (Window as Resistance) 

narrow window 1 in late May implied continuation of  the decline. It also 
became  resistance  within  the  next  few  weeks.  Interpreting  window  2 
offers a  chance  to  underscore  the  importance  of  the  trend.  Real  estate 
agents  say  the  three  most important  factors about  a  property  are  loca- 
tion, location, and location. To  paraphrase this, the three most important 
aspects of  the market are trend,  trend,  and trend. Here,  in Exhibit 7.9, 
we see a market whose major trend is southward. 

In  this  environment,  a  bullish  morning star  emerges.  Do  you  buy? 
No,  because the major  trend is down! Covering some shorts  would  be 
more appropriate. When should nibbling on the long side in this market 
begin? In this case,  it is if  the market  pushes above  $.I164 and buying

continued after this level. This is because in mid-July the market formed 
a window (window 2). The top of the window was $.1164. Until the bulls 
were  able  to  prove  their  vigor  by  pushing  prices  above  this  window, 
going long should be viewed as a high-risk strategy in spite of  the morn- 
ing star. The morning star  did act as support  on a test of  its low  a few 
days after it formed. Yet,  after trying for a week the bulls failed in their 
attempt to close window 2.  This told us a  new rally was not likely. The 
moral  of  this  story  is  that  candlesticks,  or  any  other  technical  tool, 
should be considered in the context of the prevailing trend. 

In Exhibit 7.10,  we see  that  the market  headed  south  after  Septem- 
ber's  hanging man and the black line which engulfed it. The window in 
late September signaled a continuation  of  the decline. The window was

closed, but buying steam quickly dissipated  as  proven  by  the  shooting 
star. 

There  are  three  windows  to  discuss  in  Exhibit  7.11.  Window 1 is  a 
downside window from March 1989. It became a resistance level over the 
following few  weeks.  Window  2  is  another  downside  window  which 
means more selling pressure will be felt. A long white candlestick a week 
after  the window formed  a bullish engulfing  pattern. This was the first 
sign  of  a  bottom.  The  next week,  the  market  closed  sharply  above  the 
window.  This generated  another  reason  to  believe  the  selling  pressure 
had dried  up. Window  3 is a  window in a rally  which  means to expect 
more strength. This window closed in the second  week of  October, but 
not for long as buying pushed prices higher and in the process fashioned 
a  hammer.  Normally hammers are important  only during a  downtrend 
(since they are bottom reversal signals). In this case, it became important 
because it  reflected a  test  of  the  window's  support  level.  If  the market 
had  continued  lower  after  this  hammer,  the  uptrend  would  have  been 
nullified. 

Exhibit  7.12  shows  a  series  of  three  windows.  Window  1 became 
support when the market sold off  a few days after the window opened. 
Window 2 stopped  the rally a month later. Window 3 kept a ceiling on

all  the  rally  attempts  during  the  week  following its  opening.  Another 
interesting aspect about  the September rally that stalled at window 2 is 
that the rally, as shown by  the numbered days 1 through 8,  made eight 
new higher highs. Candlestick theory states that after about eight to ten 
new highs or lows, without a meaningful correction, the odds are strong 
that a significant correction will  unfold.  Each  new  high or  new low for 
the move is called a "new record high" or "new record low" by the Jap- 
anese.  Thus  the Japanese will  say  there  are  ten  record  highs  or  lows, 
meaning there  were a series of  ten higher  highs or lower lows.  If  there 
are,  say, eight new highs without a meaningful correction, the Japanese 
refer to  the market by  using  the expression "the  stomach is 80% full." 
What is interesting about this gold chart is that  there  were eight  record 
highs. This gave a warning that a top might be  near. The fact  that after 
these eight record highs the market was at a resistance area set by win- 
dow 2  was an extra strong signal to  be cautious about  the long  side  of 
this market. 

The  enchanted  number  three  makes  yet  another  appearance  in 
Exhibit  7.13.  Traditional  Japanese  technical  analysis  posits  that  after 
three up or down windows,  the chances are- strong that a top (in the case 
of three windows in an uptrend) or  a bottom (in the case of  three win-

dows in  a  downtrend) is  near,  especially if  a  turning  point  candlestick 
pattern  or  line  appears  (such as  a  doji,  piercing pattern,  or  dark-cloud 
cover) after the third gap. Here we see hanging-man lines after the third 
window. 

In  the  next  few  sections,  we'll  discuss  some  continuation  patterns 
that have windows as part of  their formation. These include the upward 
and  downward  gapping  tasuki,  the  high  and  low  price  gapping  play, 
and the gapping side-by-side white lines. 

Upward- and Downward-Gap Tasuki 

The  upside-gap  tasuki  (see Exhibit  7.14) is  another  continuation  pattern. 
The market is in an uptrend. A white candlestick gaps higher and is fol- 
lowed  by  a  black  candlestick.  The  black  candlestick  opens  within  the 
white real body and closes under the white candlestick's real body. The 
close on the black candlestick day is the buy point. If  the market fills in 
the  gap  (closes the  window)  and  selling  pressure  is  still  evident,  the 
bullish  outlook  of  the  upside-gap  tasuki  is  voided.  The  same  concepts 
would  be  true,  in  reverse,  for  a  downward-gap  tasuki  (see Exhibit  7.15).

The  real bodies of  the  two  candlesticks in  the  tasuki gap  be  should  be 
about the same size. Both types of  tasuki gaps are rare. 

Look  at  Exhibit  7.16  for  an example  of  an  upside-gap  tasuki.  In  the 
last week of  September,  the market experienced a small upside gap via 
a  white  candlestick.  The  next  weekly  black  candlestick  opened  in  the 
prior  week's  real  body  and  closed  under  that  white  real  body's  open. 
This created an upside-gap  tasuki.  Note how the small window opened 
by  this  pattern  provided  support  in  the  October  pullback. The  bullish 
belt hold signaled the advent of  the rally.

EXHIBIT  7.18.  Low-price Gapping Play 

High-price and Low-price Gapping Plays 

It is  normal after a sharp one to two session advance for  the market  to 
consolidate the gains. Sometimes this consolidation is by a series of  small 
real bodies.  A group of  small real bodies after a strong session  tells us 
that the market is undecided. However, if  there is an upside gap on the 
opening  (that is,  a  window) from  these  small  real  bodies,  it  is  time  to 
buy.  This is high-price gapping  play  pattern  (see Exhibit  7.17). It  is called 
this  because prices hover  near  their  recent  highs and  then  gaps  to  the 
upside. 

A low-price gapping play is, not surprisingly, the bearish counterpart of 
the  high-price  gapping  play.  The  low-price  gapping  play  (see  Exhibit 
7.18)  is  a  downside  window  from  a  low-price  congestion  band.  This 
congestion  band  (a series  of small real  bodies) initially stabilized a  steep 
one to two session decline. At first, this group of  small candlesticks gives 
the appearance  that a base is forming. The break to  the downside via  a 
window dashes these bullish hopes. 

Exhibit 7.19 illustrates that in late Octoberlearly November, a series of 
three  small  real  bodies  helped  digest  the  gains  of  the  prior  tall  white 
candlestick  session.  When  sugar  gapped  up  it  completed  the  first 
upward-gapping play pattern on this chart.  The market rallied until the 
dark-cloud cover on November 17 and 18.  High-price gapping play pat- 
tern 2 had a tall  white candlestick session,  some small real bodies, and 
then a window. This window converted to support level. 

The candlesticks in Exhibit  7.20 sent  a bullish signal when the win- 
dow  opened  on June 29.  This window completed  the action needed  to 
form  the  upward-gapping  play.  Prior to this gapping play,  there was a 
strong a strong white candlestick on June 11.  A group of  small candle- 
sticks followed  this line.  This had  the potential  to become a high-price 
gapping play. No upward gap,  however,  meant a no buy signal. 

As shown in Exhibit 7.21,  on July 20  and 21 the S&P quickly fell 18 
points. It then traded sideways at lower price levels for over a week (for

a gapping play, the consolidation should not last more than 11 sessions). 
A Japanese broker related to me that one of  her clients in Japan (a fund 
manager  who  applies  candlesticks) obtained  a  sell  signal  on  August  2 
(see arrow at the doji) based on the low-price gapping  play pattern. 

This  shows  an  aspect  about  the  candlesticks  which  has  been  dis- 
cussed earlier. The techniques and procedures used to interpret the can- 
dlestick  patterns are guidelines,  not hard  and fast rules.  Here we have 
an  example  where  the  ideals  of  the  low-price  gapping  play  were  not 
exactly  meet,  yet  the  Japanese  fund  manager  thought  it  was  close 
enough to act on. In principle, for a low-price gapping play to be com- 
pleted the market should gap lower. The low on August 1 was at 355.80 
and the high on August 2 was 355.90. Thus there was no gap. Yet it was 
close  enough  that  the  Japanese  fund  manager  got  his  sell  signal  on 
August 2. Note also the sharp decline preceding the small real bodies did 
not close on  the low. Yet,  because prices stayed  within  the lows of  the 
range during the next few sessions,  it resembled the low-price gapping 
play closely enough to provide the Japanese candlestick practitioner with

a sell signal on August 2.  This is an illustration of  how candlestick pat- 
terns, as with all charting techniques,  offer room for subjectivity. 

Gapping Side-by-side  White Lines 

In an uptrend,  an upward-gapping  white candlestick followed  the next 
session  by another similar sized  white candlestick with  about  the same 
opening is a bullish continuation pattern. This two candlestick pattern is 
referred to as upgap side-by-side white lines (see Exhibit 7.22). If  the market 
closes above the  higher  of  the side-by-side white  candlesticks, another 
leg up should unfold. 

The  side-by-side  white  candlesticks  described  previously  are  rare. 
Even more rare are side-by-side white lines which gap lower. These are 
called  downgap side-by-side white  lines  (see Exhibit 7.23). In a downtrend, 
the  side-by-side  white  lines  are  also  a  continuation  pattern.  That  is, 
prices should continue lower. The reason this pattern is not bullish (as is 
the upgap  variety) is because in a falling market,  these  white lines are 
viewed  as  short  covering.  Once  this  short  covering evaporates,  prices 
should  move  lower.  The  reason  that  the  downgap  side-by-side  white 
line  pattern  is  especially  rare  is  because  black  candlesticks,  not  white 
candlesticks, are more natural in a market that lowers gaps. If  in a fall- 
ing  market  a  black  candlestick gaps  lower  and  is  followed  by  another 
black  candlestick  with  a  lower  close,  the  market  should  experience 
another price decline. 

Exhibit 7.24 shows a downgap side-by-side white line pattern in early 
March. The  theory  behind  this  pattern  during a downtrend is  that  it is 
short  covering.  Thus  it  offers  only  a  temporary  respite  from  a  falling 
market. That is  what we saw here as the market resumed its drop after 
a  period  of  consolidation.  This  is  not  an  ideal  downgap  side-by-side

white  line  pattern  since  the opens  on  the  white  candlesticks were  not 
identical and  the white lines were separated  by  one  day.  Nonetheless, 
this is likened to the downgap side-by-side white line pattern. 

In  addition,  Exhibit  7.24 shows  two  upgap  side-by-side  white  line 
patterns. This pattern portends bullish implications if  it emerges at lower 
price  levels.  The  first  upgap  side-by-side white  line  pattern  had  three 
opens at about  the same price. Then the market staged  a brief  pullback 
on May  8 which  marginally  broke  under  the window but sprang  right 
back from there. The second upgap side-by-side white line pattern gave 
another bullish signal. As should be the case with the upgap side-by-side 
white lines, they provided a firm footing. 

RISING  AND FALLING THREE METHODS 

These three methods include the bullish rising  three methods and the bear- 
ish  falling  three  methods.  (Note  how  the  number  three  again  makes  an 
appearance.) These are both continuation patterns. The benchmarks for 
the rising three methods pattern (see Exhibit 7.25) include: 

136

EXHIBIT 7.25.  Rising Three Methods 

I 

1.  A long white candlestick. 

2.  This  white  candlestick  is  followed  by  a  group  of  falling  small  real 
body candlesticks. The ideal number of  small candlesticks is three but 
two or  more than  three are  also acceptable as long as  they basically 
hold  within  the  long  white  candlestick's  range.  Think  of  the  small 
candlesticks as forming a pattern similar to a three-day harami pattern 
since they hold within the first session's  range.  (For this pattern that 
would include holding within the shadows; for a true harami it would 
only include the real body.) The small candlesticks can be any color, 
but black is most common. 

3.  The final day should be a strong white real body session with a close 
above the first day's close. The final candlestick line should also open 
above the close of  the previous session. 

This  pattern  resembles  the  Western  bull flag  or  pennant  formation. 
Yet,  the concept behind  the rising three  methods is from the 1700s. The 
three methods pattern is considered a rest from trading and a rest from 
battle.  In  more  modern  terms,  the  market  is,  with  the  group  of  small 
candles, "taking a breather." 

The  falling  three  methods  pattern  (see  Exhibit  7.26) is  the  bearish 
counterpart  of  the  rising  three  methods  pattern.  For  this  pattern  to 
occur, the market should be in a downtrend and a long black candlestick 
should  emerge. It is followed  by about  three small rising candles  (usu- 
ally  white) whose  real  bodies  hold  within  the  first  candlestick's  range 
(including shadows). The final session should open under the prior close 
and  then  close  under  the  first  black  candlestick's  close.  After  this  last

black  candlestick  session,  the  market  should  head  lower.  This  pattern 
resembles a bear flag or pennant formation. 

Exhibit 7.27 shows a classic rising three methods pattern. The market 
is in  an  uptrend  with  three  downtrending  black small  real bodies  pre- 
ceded  by  a  white  candlestick.  The  black  candlesticks essentially  held 
within  the  white  candlestick's  range.  The  last  white  candlestick  then 
closes above  the  first  candlestick's  close.  A factor  that  may  lend  more 
significance to this pattern is if  volume on the white (black) sessions for 
the rising (falling) three method pattern is higher than the small candle- 
stick  sessions.  Here  we  see  the  white  session  days  of  the  rising  three 
methods pattern had greater volume than on  the three small black can- 
dlestick sessions. 

Exhibit 7.28 is also a rising three methods pattern. When completed, 

the bonds pushed until they reached the bearish engulfing pattern. 

Although the ideal three methods has three small candlesticks follow- 
ing  a  long  white  one,  Exhibit  7.29  is  an  example  of  two  small  candle- 
sticks. The price action in June 1988 built a tall white candlestick. Black 
candlesticks that  held  within  this white  candlestick's range followed in 
July and  August.  September  formed  another  white  candlestick  which 
made a new high for  the move but failed to close above June's close by

only 3 ticks. Normally, we would want to see a higher close. In this case, 
since  the last white  candlestick  (September) only missed  closing above 
June's  close  by  3  ticks,  this  pattern  should  still  be  considered  a  rising 
three methods pattern with bullish confirmation the next session. A new 
high close in October gave this confirmation and secured the bullish out- 
look. 

Three small candlesticks held  within  the first candlestick's high  and 
low  range  are  evident  in  Exhibit  7.30.  These  were  trailed  by  another 
white candlestick. This last white candlestick had  the same close as the 
first one,  so we  need confirmation. When  the next  hour  opened  above 
the last white candlestick, the bullish confirmation was at hand. Observe 
how the top of  the rising three methods pattern became a support area 
as tested by the first hour on August 1. 

Two  examples of  this  bullish continuation  pattern appear in Exhibit

there  can  be  two candlesticks instead  of  three,  after the first  tall  white 
real body.  Notice  how  the  two  black  candlesticks held  within  the first 
candlestick's range. Then the last white real body of  this pattern opened 
above the close of  the  prior session and  made a new high close for  the 
move. The second illustration of  this pattern in Exhibit 7.31 displays how 
the color of  the real bodies after the first candlestick does not have to be 
black. As long as the real bodies hold within  the first session's  range it 
has the potential to  be a three methods  pattern.  Here the potential was 
fulfilled as the last long white candlestick closed at a new high. 

In March 1989,  a window appeared  as shown in Exhibit 7.32.  Based 
on  the  saying  that  corrections go  to  the  window,  one  should  expect  a 
bounce up to the window. From there the preceding downtrend should 
resume.  After  the  window,  three  small  real  bodies  developed.  The 
assault  on  the  window  took  place  on  the  first  week  of  April.  It  failed 
from there. Two weeks later, on the third small white candlestick week, 
there  was  another  attempt  to  close  the  window.  This  attempt  also fal- 
tered. The last long black candlestick closed under the first black candle- 
stick's  close.  This  action  completed  the  five  candlesticks of  the  falling 
three methods. 

Exhibit 7.33 is an example with four, instead of  three, small real bod- 
ies. The key is that the real bodies hold within the first day's  range. The 
last  large  black  candlestick  concluded  this  pattern.  Note  how  tick vol- 
ume'"  confirmed  the  black  candlesticks  action.  That  is,  tick  volumeT" 
expanded  with  the  black candlesticks and  shrank  with  the intervening

white candlesticks.  We  will go into more detail about  candlesticks with 
volume in Chapter 15,  including tick volumeTM. 

The  intra-day  chart 

in  Exhibit  7.34  addresses  an  important 
principle-do  not act  on a formation until  that formation is  completed. 
Here, for instance, is an example of  an incomplete falling three methods. 
A lengthy  black real body developed  during  the first hour on April 23. 
Three uptrending small real bodies then appeared.  A long black candle- 
stick follows these small candlesticks. The close on the fifth hour's  can- 
dlestick was not under the close of  the first hour's  candlestick. Thus the 
falling three methods was not completed. If  there is bearish confirmation 
during the next session, the action should still be viewed as confirmation 
of  a  bearish falling three  methods  since  the  closes  of  the first  and  last 
black candlesticks were so close. In this case,  there was no bearish con- 
firmation over the next hour or two. 

A doji appeared after the last black real body. This doji,  joined with 
the  prior  black  real  body,  fashioned  a  harami  cross. This  is  a  reversal 
pattern which hinted that the immediately preceding downtrend would 
not  persist.  In addition,  the lows over  the  next  few  hours successfully 
tested all the hourly lows from April 23. Thus, if  one anticipated that the 
falling  three  methods  would  be  completed,  one  would  have  guessed

wrong.  Wait  until the pattern is formed,  or confirmed,  before acting on 
its implications! 

Exhibit 7.35 is a  classic falling three  method  whose  bearish  implica- 
tion was negated by the hammer. If  the hammer was not enough to tell 
one the downleg was ending more proof  was added with the white ses- 
sion following the hammer. This completed a bullish engulfing  pattern. 

THREE ADVANCING WHITE  SOLDIERS 

Like  much  of  the  candlestick  terminology,  this  pattern  has  a  military 
association. It  is  known as  the  three  advancing  white  soldiers  (see Exhibit 
7.36) or, more commonly, three white soldiers.  It is a group of  three white 
candlesticks with consecutively higher closes. If  this pattern appears at a 
low price area after a period of  stable prices, then it is a sign of  strength 
ahead. 

The  three  white  soldiers  are  a  gradual  and  steady  rise  with  each 
white  line  opening  within  or  near  the  prior  session's  white  real  body. 
Each of  the white candlesticks should close at,  or  near,  its highs.  It  is a

healthy method for the market to rise (although if  the white candlesticks 
are very extended, one should be cautious about an overbought market). 
If  the second and  third,  or  just  the  third  candlestick, show signs  of 
weakening it is an advance block  pattern (see Exhibit 7.37). This means that 
the  rally  is  running  into  trouble  and  that  longs  should  protect  them- 
selves.  Be  especially  cautious  about  this  pattern  during  a  mature 
uptrend.  Signs of  weakening could  be  progressively smaller  white  real 
bodies or  relatively long upper shadows on the latter two white candle- 
sticks. 

If  the last two candlesticks are long white ones that make a new high 
followed  by  a  small  white  candlestick,  it  is  called  a  stalled  pattern  (see 
Exhibit 7.38). It  is  also sometimes called  a deliberation  pattern.  After  this 
formation  the  bull's  strength  has  been  at  least  temporarily  exhausted. 
This last small white candlestick can either gap away from the long white 
body  (in  which  case  it  becomes  a  star)  or  it  can  be,  as  the  Japanese 
express it, "riding on the shoulder" of  the long white real body (that is, 
be  at  the  upper end  of  the  prior long  white  real body). The  small real 
body discloses a deterioration of  the bulls'  power. The time of  the stalled 
pattern is the time for the longs to take profits. 

Although the advance block and stalled patterns are not normally top 
reversal  patterns,  they  can  sometimes  precede  a  meaningful  price 
decline. The advance block and stalled patterns should be used  to liqui- 
date or  protect longs  (for example, sell covered  calls) but  not  to  short. 
They are generally more consequential at higher price levels. 

In Exhibit 7.39, the three white soldiers from a low price level in 1985 
projected  a  rally.  There  follows  two  advance  block  patterns.  Advance 
block 1 has progressively smaller white  real bodies in early 1987 which 
did  not bode  well for  higher  prices.  A  shooting  star  was  the last  small 
white  real body of  this three candlestick group. The market floundered 
for  the next few  months.  There was another  price push after these doji 
but  the  next  advanced  block  pattern  gave  another  warning  sign. 
Advance block 2 formed in mid-1987. The major difference between this 
three white candlestick pattern and the three  white soldiers in advance

block 1 is that the last  white candlestick had a longer  upper shadow. It 
was not very long, but it showed that the market did not have the power 
to close near  the highs.  In other  words,  the lead  (that is,  advance) sol- 
dier had been "blocked." A hanging-man line appeared next month. The 
soldiers then went into retreat. 

There  was  another  reason to  be  suspicious  about  more  upside after 
advance block 2. Whereas the three white soldiers in 1985 started from a 
low price level, the three white candlesticks of  the advance block pattern 
arose after the market had already sustained an extended advance. 

In  early 1989  (see Exhibit  7.40),  stalled  pattern 1 temporarily  stalled 
the prior price incline. Additionally, this pattern came after an extended 
series of  white candles. 

Stalled pattern 2 only stalled the advance for a couple of  weeks. The 
last  small  real  white  body  in  this  deliberation  pattern  was  a  hanging 
man. Once the market closed above the hanging man's  high two weeks 
later,  the  market  was  not  likely  to  fall.  In  early  July,  the  bullish  three 
white soldiers started a  meaningful rally. It lasted  for  seven  new highs 
three  white  soldiers 
(that  is,  seven  record  highs).  Another  set  of 
appeared  in  the  third  quarter 1989.  Because  each  of  these  three  white 
candlesticks  closed  at  their  high,  this  pattern  had  all  the  earmarks  of

implying another strong rally, similar to the one that had started in July. 
This  was  not  to be.  The-week after  the  third  white  candlestick of  this 
group, a small real body emerged. This formed a harami and told us the 
prior uptrend had run into trouble. The shooting star a few weeks later 
confirmed problems at these highs. 

Exhibit 7.41 illustrates three stalled patterns.  Pattern 1 also formed a 
harami which short circuited the rally. Stalled pattern 2 failed to keep the 
rally in check, while stalled pattern 3 contained  a shooting star. Stalled 
pattern 3 induced a trend change as the market went from  up,  to side- 
ways for a few weeks.  Remember that the stalled pattern is  not usually 
a trend reversal,  it often means a time of  deliberation before the market 
decides its next trend. In the case of  stalled pattern 3,  a window opened 
after the congestion band completing a bullish high-price gapping play. 
This indicated a resumption of  strength. 

SEPARATING LINES 

In Chapter 6,  we examined the counterattack line.  Remember,  this is a 
white or black candlestick line with the same close as the previous oppo- 
site color candlestick and it is a reversal signal. Whereas the counterat- 
tack line has the same close, the separating lines in Exhibit 7.42 have the 
same open as the previous opposite color candlestick. The separating line 
is a continuation pattern. 

During a  market  rise,  a  black  real body  (especially a  relatively long 
one)  would  be  cause  for  concern if  you  are  long.  The  bears  might  be 
gaining control. However,  if  the  next session's  opening gaps higher  to 
open  at  the  previous  black  session's  opening  price,  it  shows  that  the 
bears  lost  control of  the  market.  If  this  white  candlestick session  then 
closes  higher,  it  tells  us  the  bulls  have  regained  control and  the  prior 
price rise should  continue. This is  the scenario which  unfolds  with  the

bullish  separating  line as  shown  in  Exhibit 7.42.  The  white line should 
also be a bullish belt hold  (that is,  open on the low of  the session). The 
opposite  would  be  true with  the  bearish separating line in exhibit 7.42. 
This is viewed as a bearish continuation  pattern. 

THE  MAGIC DOJI

sudden danger" 

A s  described in Chapter 3,  a doji is a candlestick in which the opening 
and  closing  prices  are  the  same.  Examples  of  doji  lines  are  shown  in 
Exhibits 8.1 through 8.3. The doji is such a significant reversal indicator 
that this chapter is devoted solely to its manifestations. In prior chapters, 
we  have  seen  the  power  of  a  doji  as  a  component  of  some  patterns. 
These  included  the  doji  star  (see Chapter  5 , )  and  the  harami  cross  (see 
Chapter 6 ) .

THE  IMPORTANCE OF THE  DOJI 

The  perfect  doji  session  has  the  same  opening  and  closing  price,  yet 
there is some flexibility to this rule. If  the opening and closing price are 
within a few ticks of  each other (for example, a  1/4 cent in grains or a few 
thirty-seconds in bonds,  and  so on),  the line could  still be  viewed as a 

150 

The Basics 

doji.  How  do you  decide  whether  a  near-doji  day  (that is,  where  the 
open and close are very close, but not exact) should be considered a doji? 
This is subjective and  there are no rigid rules but one way is to look at 
a  near-doji day in  relation to  recent  action.  If  there are a series of  very 
small real bodies,  the  near-doji day would  not  be  viewed as significant 
since so many other recent periods had small real bodies. One technique 
is based on recent market activity. If  the market is at an important  mar- 
ket  junction, or is at the mature part of  a bull or bear move, or there are 
other technical signals sending out an alert, the appearance of  a near-doji 
is  treated  as  a  doji.  The  philosophy  is  that  a  doji  can  be  a  significant 
warning and that it is better  to attend  to a false warning than to ignore 
a real one. To  ignore a doji,  with all its inherent implications, could  be 
dangerous. 

The doji is a distinct trend change signal. However,  the likelihood of 
a reversal increases if  subsequent candlesticks confirm the doji's  reversal 
potential.  Doji  sessions  are important  only  in  markets  where  there are 
not many  doji. If  there are many doji on a  particular chart,  one should 
not  view  the  emergence  of  a  new  doji  in  that  particular  market  as  a 
meaningful  development.  That  is  why  candlestick  analysis  usually 
should  not  use  intra-day  charts  of  less  than  30  minutes.  Less  than  30 
minutes  and  many  of  the  candlestick  lines  become  doji  or  near  doji 
(except for the very active markets such as bond and S&P futures). 

DOJI AT TOPS 

Doji are valued for their ability to call market tops. This is especially true 
after a long white candlestick in an uptrend (see Exhibit 8.4). The reason 
for  the  doji's  negative implications in  uptrends is because a  doji repre- 
sents  indecision.  Indecision,  uncertainty,  or  vacillation  by  buyers  will 
not  maintain  an  uptrend. It  takes  the conviction  of  buyers  to sustain  a 
rally. If  the market has had an extended rally, or is overbought, and then 
a doji surfaces (read "indecision"), it could mean the scaffolding of  buy- 
ers'  support will give way.

EXHIBIT 8.5.  Bonds-June, 1990,  Daily (Doji at Tops) 

Yet,  as  good  as  doji  are  at  calling  tops,  based  on  experience,  they 
tend  to lose reversal potential in downtrends. The reason may be that a 
doji reflects a balance between  buying and selling forces. With ambiva- 
lent  market  participants,  the  market  could  fall  due  to  its  own  weight. 
Thus,  an  uptrend  should  reverse but a falling market  may  continue its 
descent. Because of  this,  doji need more confirmation to signal a bottom 
than they do a top. This is examined on Exhibit 8.5. 

As seen in Exhibit 8.5,  after doji 1,  the bond's  uptrend changed  to a 
lateral band. The market summit was at doji 2.  Doji 2 was a long-legged 
doji.  A  long-legged doji means a doji with one or  two very  long  shad- 
ows. Long-legged doji are often signs of  a market top. More about them 
later in this chapter.  We  can see how important  doji 1 and 2 were after 
uptrends  in  calling  a  trend  reversal.  (The  October  31  doji  was  in  the 
middle  of  a  trading band  and  thus unimportant.) Once  prices broke  to 
the downside,  doji 3,  4,  5,  6, and 7 developed.  Yet,  these .doji were  not 
reversals.  The  market  still  continued  down  after  they  appeared.  Only

EXHIBIT 8.6.  Wheat-Monthly  (Doji at Tops) 

when doji 8 and 9 formed  a  double  bottom  was  there  a  trend  reversal 
(albeit temporary). Thus there may be less need for confirmation of  a top 
reversal via a doji than for a bottom reversal. 

Exhibit 8.6 illustrates that the rally which began in mid-1987, gave its 
first sign of  peaking with doji 1. Another warning flag was hoisted  with 
doji 2,  a few months later.  The hanging man after doji 2 confirmed the 
top.  A  minor  rally  attempt  ended  in  late  1989  at  doji  3.  This  exhibit 
exemplifies that confirmation after a doji increases success in projecting 
a  trend  reversal.  The  white  candlestick,  which  appeared  a month  after 
doji 1,  did not confirm the top hinted at by doji 1. Bearish confirmation 
came only after doji 2.  After doji 2,  this verification came in the form of 
a hanging man and then a long black candlestick. Confirmation of  doji 3 
as a top came with the next month's  long black candlestick session. 

The more conservative trading style used,  the more important it is to 
wait for  verification  of  a  trend  change.  How  long  should  one  wait  for 
corroboration? It  is  a  trade-off  between  risk  and  reward.  If  one  bases 
one's  trading style  on waiting  for  trend  reversal corroboration less  risk 
should  be involved  but,  it  also could  provide  less  reward.  By  the  time 
the reversal is substantiated,  profit potential  may be reduced. 

Exhibit 8.7 shows three doji, each after an uptrend. Doji 1 signaled a

minor top. Doji 2 did not correctly call a reversal, but it was followed the 
next  day  by  an  $.08 decline.  Doji 3 is  interesting.  It  is  more  important 
than the prior two doji since it followed a series of  three long white can- 
dlesticks and it formed  a harami cross. Doji 3 strongly stressed  that the 
prior uptrend might be over. When it appeared, longs should have taken 
protective  measures  (the  prior  strong  uptrend  negated  short  selling). 
This  means  that  they should  either  be liquidating  some  longs,  moving 
up protective stops levels,  andlor selling calls. 

An intra-day  spike  higher  the  next day made it  appear  that the  pre- 
diction about the end of  the uptrend was going to be wrong. But, on that 
day,  the  market  sold  off  sharply  toward  the  close.  This  action  helped 
confirm  the  original  view  that  the  prior  uptrend  was  about  over.  The 
market  then  went  into  a  congestion  phase  for  the  next  few  weeks.  A 
pattern  resembling  an  evening  star  then  arose.  It  was  not  an  ideal 
evening  star  pattern  since  the  star  portion  did  not  gap  away  from  the 
prior long white real body, yet it presaged  a top.

The Basics 

DOJI AFTER  A LONG WHITE CANDLESTICK 

Exhibit  8.8 shows  that  a  doji  after  a  long  white  candlestick, especially 
after a prolonged uptrend, is often a forewarning that a top is near. This 
exhibit has three examples of  this concept: 

1.  In  August  1989,  a  doji  followed  two  long  white  candlesticks.  After 
doji 1,  the prior  uptrend  (which began  with  a bullish hammer  from 
August 22) went from up to sideways. 

2.  Doji 2, in early November, was preceded by a long white candlestick. 
When this doji emerged,  the minor rally,  which preceded it, ended. 
Within a few days, the Dow had broken under the late October lows. 
During the last few weeks of  1989,  the Dow had a steep advance that 
pushed  above  the 2800  level.  But  look  at  where  the  rally  was  short 
circuited-after  the appearance  of  doji 3. The fact  that this doji came 
after a long white candlestick meant  that  the buyers,  which were in 
control the  prior  day  (as proven  by  the long  white  candlestick) had 
lost control. The next day's  black candlestick increased the probability 
that  the  market  had  crested.  It  also  completed  an  evening  doji star 
formation. 

In this example, we see another strength of  candlestick charting; they 
provide  a  signal  not  obtainable  with  Western  technical  analysis  tech- 
niques. To  non-Japanese technicians, if  a session's open and close are the 
same, no forecasting implications are taken. To  the Japanese, such a ses- 
sion, especially at the heels of  a sharp advance, is a critical reversal sign. 
Exhibit 8.9 illustrates a modest rally which began with a hammerlike 
line in mid-March (the lower shadow was not long enough nor was the 
real body  small  enough  to  be  a  true  hammer),  culminated  with  a  doji 
after a long white line. This doji day was also part of  an evening doji star 
pattern. An "ideal" hammer on April 6 stopped  the price decline. 

Exhibit 8.10  illustrates that an uptrend  that  thrusted  bonds  7 points 
higher,  ended  with  a  doji  following  the  long  white  real  body.  Exhibit 
8.11 shows  that  a  rally  commenced  with  the  hammer  on  April  19.  It 
ended on April 23 when a doji appeared after a long white candlestick. 

THE  LONG-LEGGED DOJI AND THE  RICKSHAW MAN 

The long-legged doji is an especially important doji at tops.  As shown in 
Exhibit 8.2,  this doji has long upper and lower shadows,  clearly reflect-

ing  irresolution.  Throughout  the  session,  the  market  pushed  strongly 
higher,  then sharply lower (or vice versa). It then closed at, or very near, 
the opening price. If  the opening and closing are in the center of  the ses- 
sion's  range,  the line is referred  to as a  rickshaw  man.  If  there is a  non- 
doji session  with  a very  long  upper  and/or lower shadow  with  a  small 
real body, the line is referred to as a high-wave line. A group of  high-wave 
candlesticks are a  reversal formation.  To  the Japanese, very long  upper 
or lower shadows represent a candlestick that has,  as they say, "lost its 
sense of  direction. " 

In  Exhibit  8.12,  late  April  and  early  May  trading  sessions  were 
marked  by  a series  of  doji or  near-doji days.  These  narrow real bodies 
are an unhealthy sign after a rally. They indicate tired markets. In a rally 
one likes to see the buyers in control. The long-legged doji (in this case, 
two rickshaw-man lines) were a major danger sign  (although the open- 
ing and  closing on  the first  one  were  not  exactly  the  same,  they  were 
close enough to be considered a doji day). These long-legged doji reflects 
a market that has "lost its sense of  direction." This group of  small range 
candlestick days formed  a  major  top.  With  these  bearish  candles  over- 
hanging the market,  we can perhaps  jokingly call this the "falling chan- 
delier formation."

EXHIBIT 8.13.  London Lead-1990,  Three Month (Long-legged Doji) 

Exhibit  8.13  has  a  strong  hint  of  a  peak  with  the  long-legged  doji 
(here the opening and closing were close enough  to consider this a doji 
session). The long-legged doji day also completed a harami pattern and 
a  tweezers top. This  confluence of  technical factors  were forceful clues 
that the highs were at hand. Exhibit 8.14 illustrates that a price peak in 
gold was reached with the long-legged doji in January. The long upper 
shadows  in  early  February  confirmed  the  resistance  set  by  the  long- 
legged doji.

THE GRAVESTONE DOJI 

The gravestone doji (see Exhibit 8.3) is another distinctive doji. It develops 
when the opening and closing prices are at the low of  the day. While it 
can  sometimes  be found  at  market  bottoms,  its forte is  in  calling tops. 
The  shape  of  the  gravestone  doji  makes  its  name  appropriate.  As  we 
have discussed,  many of  the Japanese technical terms are based on mil- 
itary  analogies,  and in  this context,  the gravestone  doji also  represents 
the graves of  those bulls or  bears who have died  defending  their  terri- 
tory. 

The reason for the bearish implications of  the gravestone doji after a 
rally  can be explained  simply. The market opens on the low of  the ses- 
sion. It  then rallies (preferably to a new high for  the move). Then  trou- 
ble occurs for the longs as prices plummet to the day's  lows. The longer 
the  upper shadow and  the  higher  the  price level,  the more bearish  the 
implications of  the gravestone doji. 

Exhibit 8.15 shows that April 11 and 12 are doji days. The second doji

is the one of  most interest. It is a gravestone  doji. In this case, it  marks 
the  end  of  the  battle  for  the  bulls  as  the  bears  take  over  when  the 
uptrend  support  line  is  broken.  (This  topic  of  candlesticks  with 
trendlines  is  examined  in  detail  in  Chapter 11.) Exhibit  8.16  illustrates 

 
 
 
The Magic Doji  161 

that  the  gravestone  doji  on  October  8  (the  very  minor  lower  shadow 
does not void this as a gravestone) was especially negative for this stock. 
On that day, a new high was touched. It was the bulls'  chance to propel 
prices,  but  they failed.  By  the close,  prices had  pulled  back  to  near  the 
daily low. There was trouble at this $41 level before. Beginning on Sep- 
tember 29,  three candlestick lines developed  into a stalled  pattern. The 
gravestone doji confirmed the heavy supply at  $41. 

Some  of  you  may  have  noticed  that  a  gravestone  doji  looks  like  a 
shooting  star.  The  gravestone  doji,  at  tops,  is  a  specific  version  of  a 
shooting star.  The  shooting  star  has  a  small  real  body,  but  the  grave- 
stone doji-being  a doji-has  no real body. The gravestone doji is more 
bearish than a shooting star. 

DOJI AS SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE 

Doji,  especially at significant tops  or bottoms,  can sometimes  turn into 
support  or  resistance zones.  Exhibit 8.17 shows  how the lower  shadow

of  the doji week in September 1989 became a support area. The doji star 
top in late September became a resistance level. 

In Exhibit 8.18, the rickshaw man (the real body was small enough to 
consider it a doji) on the first hour of  March 21 gave a clue that the pre- 
vious uptrend could be reversing. A doji occurring a few hours later give 
more  proof for this  outlook.  These  two  doji became a  significant resis- 
tance area. 

THE  TRI-STAR 

The  tri-star  (see Exhibit 8.19) is a very rare, but a very significant rever- 
sal pattern.  The tri-star is formed by three doji lines. The middle doji is 
a  doji star.  I have yet  to see  an ideal  tri-star,  as shown in Exhibit 8.19, 
but the following examples show the significance of  this pattern even in 
its variations. The reason we are discussing this pattern here, instead of 

The Magic Doji

Tri-star Bottom 

EXHIBIT 8.19. 

Tri-star Top and Bottom 

in the chapter on stars,  is because the most important aspect of  this pat- 
tern is that the lines should be three doji (or near-doji). 

Exhibit 8.20 shows that early in the week of  September 15 there were 
two doji followed by a third,  small real body candlestick. This variation 
on a tri-star was the start of  a $.I5 rally. Exhibit 8.21 shows that in late 
September 1989,  the  Dow  began  a  rally  that  culminated  in  a  series  of 
three doji in early October. Although not an ideal tri-star, the three doji 
after  a  170-point advance  was a  portentous  sign.  Notice  that  the latter 
two doji also formed a tweezer top.

"The Water of  Even a  Great  Ocean Comes One  Drop at  a  Time" 

I n  Part I of  this book,  we've  examined many candlestick lines and for- 
mations.  This  chapter  is  a  visual  summary.  The  following  charts  (see 
Exhibits  9.1,  9.2,  and  9.3)  have  numbered  lines  and  patterns.  All  are 
candlestick indicators that have been discussed previously. How would 
you interpret them? If  necessary use the visual Japanese candlestick glos- 
sary at the back  of  the book  to  help you  with  your interpretations. My 
opinion  of  these candlestick  patterns  and  lines are  provided.  But,  you 
should decide for yourself. 

Remember, the following interpretations  are subjective. You  may see 
different indicators  than  I  did,  or  some  where  I did  not.  As  with  any 
charting technique, different experiences will give different perspectives. 
There are no concrete rules,  just general guidelines.  For  example,  what 
if  a hammerlike line had a lower shadow only one and one-half  times the 
height  of  the  real body  instead  of  the  more ideal  version  with  a  lower 
shadow twice-or  even three times-the  height of  the real body. A pur- 
est  might say  this  was  not a  hammer  and  ignore it.  Others may  cover 
shorts on such a line. Still others might wait for  the next session to see 
what unfolds.

EXHIBIT 9.1.  Wheat-May, 1990,  Daily (All Together) 

Exhibit 9.1 illustrates the following aspects. 

1.  A bullish inverted  hammer  confirmed  the  next session  by a  higher 

opening and white candlestick. 

2.  A stalled pattern implies the market's  upward drive has stalled. 
3.  Adding a bearish hue to the stalled pattern in (2) is the fact that the 

last line of  this pattern is a hanging man. 

4.  The black  candlestick at  (4) confirms the  hanging  man.  Combining 
(3) and (4) provides a tweezer top and a bearish engulfing pattern. 

5.  Another  hanging man. 
6 .   A bullish engulfing  pattern  and a  bullish  white  belt-hold line  were 

signs of  a rally ahead. 

7.  That  is  until  the  hanging-man  line  appeared.  This  was  almost  an 
ideal hanging man with a very long lower shadow, a small real body 
and almost no upper shadow. Confirmation of  the bearish nature of 
this line came the next session with lack of  upside movement. 

8.  A  bullish  inverted  hammer  confirmed  the  following session.  This 

was also part of  a morning star. 

Putting  It A11  Together  167 

9.  The three-day rally that started with the inverted  hammer in (8) was 

halted by this harami pattern. 

10.  A hammer signaled a possible bottom. 
11.  A variation on the bullish piercing pattern occurred.  Instead  of  the 
second white candlestick opening under the first day's  low it opens 
under  the  first  day's  close.  It  then  rallies  and  closes  well  into  the 
black candlesticks real body. 

12.  Another hanging man occurs. But this line was not confirmed by the 

next session since the market gapped higher on the open. 

13.  A bearish engulfing  pattern occurred. 
14.  Then,  a classic piercing pattern presented itself. The second session 
of  this pattern was a bullish belt-hold line that closed on its high. It 
also successfully tested the lows made in (11). 

15.  Then, a doji star signaled an end to the rally which started at (14). 
16.  A harami called the end of  the preceding price descent. 

Exhibit 9.2 illustrates the following aspects. 

1.  A tweezers bottom and a white bullish belt hold. 
2.  A dark-cloud cover. 
3.  A window which should mean resistance. 
4.  Then a morning star arose. This morning star is a bit unusual in that 
the  third  session  was  not  a  long  white  real  body.  It,  nonetheless, 
pushed  well into the first session's  white candlestick. This morning 
star was also a successful retest of  the prior week's lows. 

5.  The  rally  that  started  at  (4) ended  via  a  minor  tweezers  top.  This 

tweezers top stopped at the window from (3). 

6 .   An  inverted  hammer  confirmed  the  next  session.  The  rally  that 
started with the inverted hammer pushed above the window's  resis- 
tance. 

7.  A harami.  The  prior  trend  (in this case,  the rally) has  been  put on 

hold. 

8.  The bearish implications of the  prior large black  candlestick session 
is  mitigated  by  the  next  day's  small  real  body.  These  two  lines 
formed a harami.  This meant that the immediately preceding move, 
in this case a downtrend,  had run out of  steam. 

9.  The  hammer  following the  harami in  (8) was added  proof  that  the 

prior downtrend was done. 

10.  A doji star which is a warning of  a top.

by  the  bearish  engulfing  pattern  that  immediately  followed  the 
harami. This engulfing pattern is an instance where, because the mar- 
ket did not make a new high on the black candlestick day, it was not 
a reversal day with  Western technical methods. Yet,  the candlesticks 
sent out a loud reversal signal.

THE RULE  OF 
MULTIPLE  TECHNICAL 
TECHNIQUES 

"It is  what all  eyes see and  all  fingers  point  to" 

--  - 

172 

The Rule of  Technical ~ e c h n i ~ u e s  

c andlestick methods,  by  themselves, are a valuable trading tool. 

But candlestick techniques become even more powerfully significant if 
they confirm a Western technical signal. This is the focus of  Part 2.  For 
example, if  a bullish belt-hold line intersects at a long-term support 
line,  there are two reasons for a bullish outlook. The candlestick indica- 
tor confirmed a Western technical indicator or,  depending on how you 
view it,  the other way around. 

This method of  looking for confirmation from different technical 

indicators is called the "Rule of  Multiple Techniques" by Arthur 
Sklarew in his book Techniques of  a  Professional  Chart  Analyst.'  This prin- 
ciple states that the more technical indicators that assemble at the same 
price area,  the greater the chance of  an accurate forecast. 

Part 2 of  this book will be based on this "Rule of  Multiple Tech- 
niques." The remainder of  this section's  introduction  will examine the 
importance of  this idea using two examples of  traditional Western tech- 
nical analysis techniques. Chapter 10 shows how a cluster of  candle- 
stick indicators provides a clear sign of  an important turning point. 
Chapters 11 to 17 marry candlesticks to some common Western techni- 
cal tools. These include trendlines,  moving averages, oscillators, and so 
forth. In each of  these chapters,  I have detailed how to use candlesticks 
to supplement traditional Western technical techniques. For novices to 
technical analysis,  or for those who need to refresh their memory on 
the basics, the introductions to Chapters 11 to 17 offer a broad, and 
admittedly cursory, explanation of  the Western technique reviewed in 
that chapter.  There are many fine books that provide much more detail 
on these Western techniques. 

After these introductions,  we'll  explore specific examples of  how to 
use the Western technical tool in combination with candlesticks. Since 
my experience is in the futures markets,  the Western techniques with 
which I  join candlesticks are based on futures technical analysis. I will 
not examine equity technical tools such as advanceldecline lines,  the 
ARMSITRIN index, specialist short sales,  and so on. Nonetheless,  the 
concept of  using candlesticks as a complimentary tool should be appli- 
cable,  no matter your technical specialty. Western techniques,  when 
joined with candlesticks, can be a powerfully efficient combination.

EXAMPLES OF THE  RULE  OF  MULTIPLE TECHNICAL 
TECHNIQUES 

This section shows, by example, how a confluence of  technical indica- 
tors can help predict  where important support or resistance may occur. 
The following examples use Western techniques. The rest of  Part 2 
addresses candlesticks. 

In late October 1989,  gold broke above a two-year downtrend resis- 

tance line when it closed above $380. This,  in combination with the 
excellent base built in 1989 at $357, was a sign  that higher  prices were 
to fslctw. After  gcld's  breakout in late 1989,  Financial  News  Network 
interviewed me about my technical outlook for gold. I said  that we 
should see a rally,  but that this rally should stop at $425 up to $433.  In 
early 1990, gold peaked at $425 before the bear market  resumed. 

How did I pick  this $425 to $433 zone as my target for resistance 

when gold was trading at that time near  $380? By  using the rule of 
multiple technical techniques. There were four separate  technical indi- 
cators hinting at major resistance at the $425 to $433 region. Refer to 
Exhibit 11.1 as I discuss these four indicators  (for this example we will 
not use candlestick patterns): 

174 

The Rule of  Technical Techniques 

1.  A 50% retracement of  the 1987 high (Area A) at $502 and the 1989 

lows (1 and 2) at $357 was $430. 

2.  The lows,  marked 1 and 2 in 1989, were a double bottom. Based on 
this double bottom, I derived a measured target of  $425.  (A double 
bottom measured move is derived  by taking the height of  the move 
between the two lows and adding this distance to the intervening 
high). 

3.  The late 1988 high was $433. 
4.  My  colleague, John Gambino, who follows Elliott Wave Theory, 

said gold was in an Elliott fourth wave count. Based  on this,  rallies 
in gold should not pierce the prior first wave's  low in early 1988 
at $425. 

These separate  technical techniques all pointed to major resistance 
near the same price area-$425  to $433. By  failing to move above the 
$425 to $433 resistance zone in gold,  the bulls could not prove their 
mettle (pun intended). It was not long before the major downtrend 
resumed in earnest. 

What would have happened if  gold went above the upper end of 

my resistance zone of  $433? Then I would have had to change my 
longer-term bearish prognosis about the market. This is why the 
technicals can be so valuable. There is always a price where I will say 
my market view is wrong. In this case, if  gold closed above $433 I 
would have changed  by long-term bearish bias. 

The market communicates to us by way of  its price activity. If  this 
activity tells me I am mistaken in my opinion,  I adjust to the market. I 
am not egocentric enough to believe that the market will adjust to me. 
That is because the market is never wrong. 

In early May, after sugar collapsed (see Exhibit II.2), I thought that 
sugar could have a temporary bounce from $.I4 (that was the bottom a 
year-long bull channel on a weekly chart as well as the lows in late 
Februarylearly March). Yet,  unless sugar pushed above the $.I515 to 
$.I520 zone I believed sugar should be viewed as in an intermediate- 
term bear market. The rally high on May 14 was $.1505. 

Where did I get this $.I515 to $.I520 zone as resistance? From iden- 

tifying four technical indicators that implied strong resistance in that 
band. Specifically: 

1.  This was a multi-tested old support level from early March through 
April. I believed that once this strong support broke, it should 
become equally strong resistance. 

2.  The 65-day moving average (which I find useful for many markets)

i 
:  One of  my  noncandlestick seminars is called  the "Techniques of  Disci- 
i  plined Trading Using Technical Analysis." In it,  I  discuss the importance 
: 
i 
: of  a disciplined approach to trading.  To  convey this idea, I  use the word 
:  "discipline" as  an anagram.  For  each  letter  of  the  word  D I S C I P L I N E   : 
: I offer a trading rule. For  the letter N my rule is "Never trade in the 
:  belief  the market is wrongH2 
i 
What do I mean by  the expression, "the market is  never wrong?" It 
:  means do not try to impose your beliefs on the market. For example, if 
: you are firmly convinced crude oil is going to rally, wait until the trend 
: is heading north before buying. Say crude oil is in a bear market. If  you 
:  buy in the expectation that a bull market will materialize, you are then 
i  trying to impose  your hopes and expectations on the market. You  are 
: fighting the trend. This could be disastrous. You  may ultimately be cor- 
:  rect in your bullish viewpoint,  but by  then it may be  too late. 
: 
As an analogy, imagine you are driving along a one-way street. You 
: 
:  notice a steamroller going down this one-way street the wrong way. You  : 
i  stop your car, take out a sign (that you always carry with you) that 
i 
:  reads, "Stop, Wrong Way!" and hold it in front of  the steamroller.  You 
i  know the steamroller is going in the wrong direction. But  the driver may  : 
i 
:  not see you in time.  By  the time the steamroller turns around,  it could 
:  be  too late. By  then you may be  part of  the pavement. 
i 
So it is with the markets.  If  you are bucking the trend,  your outlook 
:  may turn out to be correct. But  by then it  may be  too late.  Margin calls 
i 
in futures may force you out of  the position before your expected  move 
:  occurs. Or, worse,  in the end, you may be right,  but by  then you could 
:  be broke. 
i 
Do  not try to impose your will on the markets. Be  a trend  follower, 
:  not a trend  predictor.  If  you are bullish,  jump onto uptrends, if  bearish, 
:  hop onto downtrends.  One of  the Japanese books I  had  translated 
:  expresses this idea almost poetically, "buying or selling from the begin- 
:  ning without knowing the character of  the market is the same nonsense 
i  as a literary man talking about weapons.  When faced with a large bull 
:  or bear market they are sure to lose the castle; what seems safe is infi- 
:  nitely dangerous.  . . .  Waiting for  just  the right moment is virtuous and 
:  e~sential."~

intersected near the $.I515 level.  (See Chapter 13 for  more detail on 
using moving averages with candlesticks.) 

3.  Looking at the highs from area A in January and the gap at area B 

in March,  we can see the psychological importance of  the $.I5 level. 

4.  A Fibonacci 32% retracement of the move from the $.I627 peak 
(marked H) to  the $.I444 low (marked L) is $.1514. A 32% 
retracement is where first  resistance is sometimes seen after a  selloff.

A CONFLUENCE 
OF  CANDLESTICKS 
............................................................................... 

& U & & & A t L k  

" Add Caution To Caution" 

T h i s  chapter explores how a cluster of  candlestick patterns or lines that 
coincide at the same price area can make that level an important  market 
juncture.  Exhibit 10.1 shows a  confluence of  candlestick-indicators  that 
foretold a  price setback and  then another  set of  candlesticks that called 
the end of  a  selloff. In early June, a bearish  hanging-man line is imme- 
diately followed by another negative technical signal-a  doji. Prices then 
fell until a series of  candlestick indicators signaled an important bottom. 
First, is the hammer. The next day is a bullish engulfing line. A few days 
later a minor selloff confirmed the solidity of  support as the lows of  the 
hammer  day  were  maintained.  This  second  test  of  the  low  created  a 
tweezers bottom. 

The  September  hammer  in  Exhibit  10.2  presaged  a  rally.  In  late 
November, the bonds built three candlestick top reversal indicators that 
put an end to this rally. They were: 

a hanging man; 
a doji; 
and a shooting star which was the coup de'grace. 

Exhibit 10.3  illustrates  how  an  individual  candlestick  line  can  , 
multiple signals. In early April,  a long white real body is followed 1 
small real body with a long upper shadow. The shape of  this line is

of  a bearish shooting star. This line's  small real body (being within the 
previous day's  real body) makes it a harami. Finally, the top of  the upper 
shadow (that is,  the high of  the day) on the shooting star  day was also 
a failure at the February 1600 highs. 

Exhibit 10.4 shows that  within a period of  a few  weeks,  this market 
formed a tweezers bottom,  a bullish engulfing  pattern,  and  a hammer. 
Exhibit 10.5 shows that from mid to late July, a series of  bearish candle- 
stick  indications  occurred  including  a  doji  star  followed  by  three 
hanging-man lines (as shown by 1, 2 and 3). In between hanging-man 1 
and 2,  a shooting star formed. 

Exhibit 10.6  is  a  bearish  candlestick  signal within  a  bearish  candle- 
stick  signal.  The  peak  of  the  rally  in  December  was  touched  by  a 
hanging-man  session.  This hanging-man  session was  also the star  por- 
tion of  an evening star formation. Exhibit 10.7 shows that May 9 through 
11 delivered a series of  top reversal candlestick signals at the $1.12 area. 
The tall white  candlestick on May 9  was followed by  a small real body 
candlestick. This second  candlestick was a  hanging  man.  It  also,  when

joined to the prior candlestick, completed a harami pattern. On May 11, 
another  assault  at  the  $1.12  highs  occurred.  This  assault  failed  via  a 
shooting star line. These three sessions had nearly the same highs. This 
constructed  a  short-term  top.  Thus,  within  three  sessions  there  were 
four bearish indications: 

a hanging man; 
a harami; 
a shooting star; and 
tweezers top. 

The market backed off  from these highs. The $1.12 price became sig- 
nificant  resistance as  evidenced  by  the bulls'  failure  to  punch  above  it 
during mid-June's rally. This $1.12 level was important for another  rea- 
son. Once broken on the upside on June 28,  it converted to  pivotal sup- 
port.  Observe  the  doji  star  that  arose  after  the  June  28  long  white 
candlestick. We  know a doji after a long white candlestick is a top rever- 
sal.  This  means  the  prior  uptrend  should  end.  For  two  days  after  the 
doji,  the market showed  it  was running out of  breath  since  there were 
two black candlesticks locked in a lateral band. The market had run out 
of  steam-or so it had appeared. Remember the May 9 through 11 resis- 
tance area? The lows of  the two black candlestick sessions of  July 2 and 
3  held  that old  resistance as support.  The bears  had  tried  to  break  the 

A Confluence of  Candlesticks  183 

market  but  they  could  not.  Until  that  support  broke,  the  back  of  the 
short-term bull market which commenced June 26 would not be broken. 
In this scenario,  the confluence of  candlesticks which was so important 
as  a  top  on  May  9  through 11  became influential again  a  few  months 
later as important support. 

Exhibit 10.8 illustrates  how,  in  mid-1987,  a series of  candlestick sig- 
nals intimated  a  top.  Specifically, within a  month  there  was a  hanging 
man,  a  doji,  and  a  dark-cloud  cover.  After  the  dark-cloud  cover,  the 
market  sold  off  and,  in  the  process,  opened  a  window.  This  window 
became resistance on the brief  rally  just  before the  next leg lower.  The 
selloff finally ended  with  the tweezers bottom and the bullish belt-hold 
line  (although the  white  candlestick  had  a  lower  shadow  it  was  small 
enough to view this line as a bullish belt hold). 

CHAPTER  11 

CANDLESTICKS 
WITH TRENDLINES 

"Make Use of  Your Opportunities" 

T h i s   chapter  examines  candlestick  techniques  in  conjunction  with 
trendlines,  breakouts  from  trendlines,  and  old  support  and  resistance 
areas.  There are  many  ways to  determine  a trend.  One  method  is  with 
the technician's most basic tool-the  trendline.

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LINES 
WITH CANDLESTICKS 

Exhibit 11.1 shows an upward  sloping support line.  It is  made by con- 
necting at least two reaction lows. This line demonstrates that buyers are 
more aggressive than sellers since demand is stepping in at higher lows. 
This line is indicative of  a  market  that  is  trending  higher.  Exhibit 11.2 
shows  a  downward  sloping  resistance line.  It  is  derived  by  joining at 
least two reaction  highs. It shows that sellers are more aggressive than 
buyers as evidenced by the sellers willingness to sell at lower highs. This 
reflects a market that is trending lower. 

The potency of  a support or  resistance line  depends  on  the number 
of  times the line has been successfully tested,  the amount of  volume at 
each  test,  and  the  time  the  line  has been  in  force.  Exhibit 11.3 has  no 
candlestick indicators that are worth illustrating. It does represent one of 
the major advantages of  candlesticks, though. Whatever you can do with 
a bar chart, you can do with a candlestick chart. Here we see how a basic

head  and  shoulders  neckline  could  be  drawn  on  the  candlestick chart 
just as easily as with the bar chart. However,  as we will see in  the rest 
of  this chapter,  the candlesticks provide added depth to trendline  anal- 
ysis. 

Exhibit 11.4 illustrates that the lows in late March (near $173) formed 
a support area that was successfully tested in late April. This successful 
April  test  of  support  had  an extra  bullish kicker  thanks  to  the candle- 
sticks. Specifically, the three sessions on April 20 to 22 formed a bullish 
morning star pattern.

Exhibit 11.5 has a wealth of  information about  using trendlines with 

candlestick indicators. That includes: 

The emergence of  support line 1 (late January-early February) shows 
that the two lows on January 29 and 31 were the initial two points of 
this line. A third test of  this line of  February 7 was also a bullish ham- 
mer. The combination of  these two factors gave a bottom reversal sig- 
nal.  For  those  who  bought at  this area,  the  hammer's  low  could  be 
used as a protective stop out level. 
The emergence of  support line 2 (mid-January-early March) is more 
important than support line 1 since it was in effect longer. On March 
2,  the  third  test sf  this line  was  made  by  way of  a bullish hammer. 
Since the major trend was up (as shown by the upward sloping sup- 
port  line  2),  the  bullish  hammer  and  the  successful  test  of  support 
conformed to a buy signal for March 2.  Protective sell stops could be 
positioned  under  the  hammer's  low  or  under  the  upward  sloping 
support line 2.  A puncture of this  support line would  be a warning 
that  the  prior uptrend had stalled. The  harami gave  the first inkling 
of  trouble. 

This example illuminates the importance of  stops.  As  discussed  pre- 
viously,  there  were  numerous  reasons  to  believe  that  the  market  was 
going higher when it  tested support line 2 via  a hammer. Yet,  the  mar-

ket pulled back.  You  should be confident when the trade is  placed, but 
always take into account doubt and uncertainty. One of  the most impor- 
tant  concepts in  trading--especially  futures,  is  risk  control.  The  use  of 
stops is synonymous to risk control. 

Exhibit 11.6 shows dark-cloud covers 1 and 2  produced  a  resistance 
line. Dark-cloud cover 3 intersected at this resistance line and thus con- 
firmed this line's  importance  as a  supply  area.  Exhibit 11.7 shows that 
there was  a  rally  (not shown) that  stopped  at  A.  This area  provided  a 
preliminary resistance area at  .6419. A long-legged doji arose at B.  The 
fact  that this doji also surfaced near  the resistance level set by  A was a 
reason to be cautious. Points A and B gave the first two points of  a resis- 
tance line. Traders who use hourly charts would thus look for failed ral- 
lies  near  this  line  to  take  appropriate  action-especially  if  they  got  a 
confirmatory bearish candlestick indicator. At C,  there was a long-legged 
doji (like the one at B)  near the resistance line. The market then backed 
off. At D,  the white candlestick with a long upper shadow was a shoot- 
ing star. It failed at the resistance line. This white candlestick was imme- 
diately  followed  by  a  black  candlestick  that  engulfed  it.  These  two 
candles constituted a bearish engulfing pattern. 

Exhibit  11.8  shows  two  engulfing  patterns  where  pattern  1 was  a

THE  IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTIVE STOPS 

Candlesticks with Trendlines  189 

Technicals should be used to set up risklreward parameters. As such they 
will provide the analyst  with a mechanism for a risk and money manage- 
ment approach  to  trading.  Defining risk  means  using  protective stops  to 
help  protect against  unanticipated  adverse  price  movements. If  stops are 
not used,  the analyst is not taking advantage of  one of  the most powerful 
aspects of  technical analysis. 

A stop should  be placed at the time of  the original trade;  this is when 
one  is  most  objective. Stay  in  the  position  only  if  the  market  performs 
according to expectations.  If  subsequent  price action either contradicts  or 
fails to confirm these expectations, it is time to exit.  If  the market  moves 
opposite  to  the  chosen  position  you  may  think,  "why  bother  with  a 
stop-it  is  just a short-term move against  me." Thus you stubbornly stay 
with  the  position  in  the  hope  the  market  will  turn  in  your  direction. 
Remember two facts: 

1.  all long-term  trends begin as short-term  moves; and 
2.  there is no room for hope in the market. The market goes its own way 

without regard  to you or your position. 

The  market  does  not  care  whether  you  own it  or  not.  The  one  thing 
worse  than  being  wrong  is  staying  wrong.  Lose  your  opinion,  not  your 
money.  Be  proud  of  the ability  to  catch  mistakes  early.  Getting stopped 
out  concedes  a  mistake.  People  hate  to  admit  mistakes  since  pride  and 
prestige get involved.  Good  traders  will not hold  views too firmly. It has 
been said that famous private investor Warren Buffet has two rules: 

1.  capital preservation; and 
2.  don't  forget rule 1. 

Stops  are  synonymous  with  rule 1.  You  have  limited  resources.  These 
resources should be maximized, or at a minimum,  preserved. If  you are in 
a market that has moved against your  position,  it is time to exit and find 
a better opportunity. Think of  a stop as a cost of  doing business. 

Since so much of  the Japanese candlestick terminology is grounded on 
military  terminology,  we  will look  at  stops  in  this  context  as  well.  Each 
trade you make is a battle.  And you will have to do what even the great- 
est  generals  have  to  do-make  temporary,  tactical  retreats.  A  general's 
goal  is  to  preserve  troops  and  munitions.  Yours  is  to  save  capital  and 
equanimity.  Sometimes you  must lose a few battles  to  win  the  war.  The 
Japanese have a saying, "a  hook's  well lost to catch a salmon." If  you are 
stopped  out,  think  of  it  as you  would  a lost  hook.  Maybe  with  the  next 
hook you will catch your prize.

warning to longs. A few  weeks later, the second bearish engulfing pat- 
tern emerged. The  highs on engulfing pattern  2 also were a failure at a 
resistance line. Exhibit 11.9 shows an upward  sloping resistance line. It 
is a trendline that connects a series of  higher highs. While not as popu- 
lar  as  the  downward  sloping resistance line in Exhibit 11.1,  it  can be a 
useful device  for  longs. When the market approaches this kind of  line, 
longs  should  take  defensive  measures  in  anticipation  of  a  pullback. 
These  protective  measures  could  include  taking  some  profits  on  long 
positions,  moving up a  protective stop,  or  selling calls.  Although pull- 
backs should be temporary (since the major trend is up), the failure from 
this line could be an early and very tentative indication of  the beginning 
of  a new downtrend. 

Exhibit  11.10 is  a  downward  sloping support  line.  This  is  another 
type  of  line  not  used  very  often,  but  can  occasionally  be  valuable for 
those who are short. Specificaliy, the downward sloping support line is

indicative of  a downtrend (as gauged  by  the negative slope). Yet,  when 
the  market  successfully holds  this  kind  of  support  line,  shorts  should 
take defensive measures in preparation  of  a price bounce. 

In looking at Exhibit 11.11,  our first focus is on the downward  slop- 
ing support line (line A) as previously illustrated on Exhibit 11.10. Con- 
necting lows L,  and L,  provides a tentative support line. Candlestick L, 
almost touches this line before prices rebounded. This proved the valid- 
ity of  the support line. The lows at L,  were not  just a successful test of 
this downward sloping support line,  but they formed a bullish piercing 
pattern. It was time to cover shorts-or at least take defensive measures 
such as lowering stops or selling puts. It was not time to buy because the 
major  trend  was  down  (as  reflected  by  the  bear  channel  defined  by 
downward  sloping line A and the dashed  resistance line above line A). 
In this case,  it turned out that the low at L,  was the start of  a powerful 
bull move that only ended with  the appearance,  a few  months later,  of 
the long-legged doji (a rickshaw man since the opening and closing were 
in  the  middle  of  the  range)  and  the  hanging  man.  Note  the  second 
piercing pattern on October 19 and 20. 

Next, still looking at Exhibit 11.11, let us look at the upward sloping 
resistance line  (line B)  as  previously  shown  in  Exhibit  11.9. The  price 
activity  from  January 15  reflects  a  market  that  is  creating  a  series  of 
higher  highs.  Based on this  (and the dashed  support line), one can see 
that  there is a bull  trend  in force. The failure on March 6 at a  upward 
sloping  resistance line  gave  a  signal  for  longs  to  take  protective mea- 
sures. Notice this third test at this resistance line was a shooting star line 
with  its  attendant  very  long  upper  shadow  and  small  real  body.  The 
three days following the shooting star were hanging-man lines or varia- 
tions  thereof. This combination of  factors,  a  pullback from a  resistance 
line,  the  shooting  star  and  the  hanging-man  lines  gave  clear  warnings 
that the market would soon correct.

SPRINGS AND UPTHRUSTS 

Most of  the time,  the markets are not in a trending mode but rather in a 
lateral range. On such occasions, the market is in a relative state of  har- 
mony with neither the bulls nor the bears in charge. The Japanese word 
for  tranquility  and  calm  is  "wa." I  like  to  think  of  markets  that  are 
bounded in  a  horizontal  trading  zone as  being in  a state  of  "wa." It  is 
estimated that markets are in a nontrending mode as much as 70% of  the 
time.'  As such,  it would be valuable to use a trading tool  that provides 
attractive  entry  points  in  such  circumstances.  There  is  a  set  of  tools 
which are effective in such environments. They are called upfhrusts and 
springs.  They  may  be  especially  useful concepts  when  employed  with 
candlestick  techniques.  Upthrusts  and  springs  are  based  on  concepts 
popularized  by Richard Wyckoff  in the early 20th century. 

As  previously  mentioned,  when  the  markets are in  a  state  of  "wa" 
they will trade in a quiet,  horizontal band. At times, however, the bears

or bulls may assault a prior high or low level. Trading opportunities can 
arise on these occasions. Specifically, if  there is an unsustained breakout 
from  either  a  support  or  resistance  level,  it  can  present  an  attractive 
trading opportunity. In such a scenario there is a strong probability there 
will be a return to the opposite side of  the congestion band. 

There  is  an  unsustained  penetration  of  resistance  in  Exhibit 11.12. 
Prices  then  return  back  under  the  old  highs  which  had  been  "pene- 
trated." In such a scenario, one could short  and place a stop above the 
new high. The price target would be a retest of  the lower end of  the con- 
gestion band. This type of  false upside breakout  is called an upthrust. If 
an upthrust coincides with a bearish candlestick indicator it is an appeal- 
ing opportunity to short. 

The opposite of  an upthrust is the spring. The spring develops when 
prices pierce a prior low. Then prices spring back above the broken sup- 
port area  (see Exhibit 11.13). In other words,  new lows could not  hold. 
Buy  if  prices push back above the old lows. The objective would be for 
a retest  of  the congestion zone's  upper band. The stop would be  under 
the lows made on the day of  the spring.  Trading springs and upthrusts 
is so effective because they provide a clear target (the opposite end of  the 
trading range) and  protective stop (the new high  or low  made with the 
"false breakout"). 

Exhibit 11.14 is  a good example of  upthrusts with  candlesticks. Day 
A marked  the high for  the move and a resistance level (notice how the 
hanging-man line the prior day gave warning of  the end of  the uptrend). 
The dual lows at  L,  and  L,  defined the lower end of  the trading band. 
There  was  an  upthrust  on  day  B.  That  is,  the  prior  highs  at  A  were 
breached,  but  the  new  highs  did  not  hold.  The  failure  of  the  bulls  to 
maintain the new highs at B was a bearish signal. Another negative sign 
was that  day B  was  also a  shooting star. Shooting  stars are sometimes 
part of  an upthrust.  At such times, it is a powerful incentive to sell. As 
if  a bearish upthrust and a shooting star were not enough to send chills 
down a bull's  back,  the day after B  a hanging  man appeared! With  the

bearish  upthrust  at  B  we  have a  target  of  the lower  end  of  the lateral 
band,  that is,  the lows made by L,  and L,. 

Exhibit 11.15 shows that on May 1,  a  new  high for  the move as the 
CRB touched 248.44. On May 10,  the bulls managed to nudge above this 
level  by  about  25  ticks.  They  were  unable  to  sustain  these  new  highs. 
This failure was an upthrust. May 10 was also a shooting star. It spelled 
an end to the prior minor uptrend. Thus,  a short sale with a stop above 
May  10  highs  would  have  been  warranted.  The  objective  would  be  a 
retest of  the lower end of the recent trading range near 245.00. 

As  shown  in  Exhibit 11.16,  the  highs  of  April  5  overran  the  early 
March highs  near $5.40. However,  the bulls could  not defend  the  new 
higher territory. This was an upthrust. Verification of  the bearish aspect 
of  this  upthrust came via  the hanging  man in  the next session.  Exhibit 
11.17 shows in July 1987,  the CRB  found  a base  near  220  via  a  harami 
pattern. The lows made by  this harami were  successfully tested by  the 
following week's long white line which was also a bullish belt hold.  In 
the third  quarter of  that  year,  the 220.00 level was temporarily broken. 
The market then sharply rebounded and, in the process, created a ham- 
mer and a spring. The objective based on this spring was a retest of  the 
prior highs near 235.

EXHIBIT 11.17.  CRB-Cash-Weekly (Spring with Candlesticks) 

Exhibit 11.18 indicates that the early January lows were perforated in 
late February. The failure to hold the lows meant that this was a bullish 
spring. The day of the spring was also a hammer. This union of  bullish 
signals  gave  plenty  of  warning  to  the  technician  to  look  for  a  return 
move to the upper end of the JanuaryJFebruary band near $78.  Interest- 
ingly,  the  rally  stopped  in  mid-March  near  $78  at an  evening  doji  star 
formation. 

Exhibit 11.19 shows that after a harami,  the market slid. It stabilized 
at  hammer 1.  This  hammer  was also a successful  test  of  the  prior sup- 
port near $.50. Another slight pullback occurred on hammer 2. With this 
bullish hammer,  the market nudged  marginally under the summer lows 
(by 25  ticks) but  the  bears could  not  maintain  these  new lows.  Thus a 
spring, complimented by a hammer and a tweezers bottom created note- 
worthy  bullish evidence.  Exhibit 11.20  reveals that  during  the week  of 
March 12,  soybeans  touched  a low  of  $5.96 formed a  bullish engulfing

pattern and  rallied.  On  April  3,  prices broke  this  level  and  made  new 
lows. These new lows failed to hold and created a spring.  Furthermore, 
the lows on that session constructed a bullish engulfing pattern. 

Why do springs and upthrusts work so well? To  answer this,  refer to 
Napoleon's  response when asked  which troops he considered best. His 
terse response was, "those which are victori~us."~ View the market as a 
battlefield between two sets of  troops-the bulls and the bears.  The ter- 
ritory they each claim is especially evident  when  there is a lateral  trad- 
ing range.  The horizontal  resistance line is  the bears'  terrain to defend. 
The horizontal support line is the bulls1  domain to defend. 

At  times there will be "scouting parties" (this is  my  term  and  not a 
candlestick expression) sent by big traders, commercial accounts, or even 
locals  to  test  the  resolve  of  the  opposing  troops.  For  instance,  there 
might be a push by the bulls to try to move prices above a resistance line. 
In such  a battle,  we have  to monitor  the determination  of  the bears.  If 
this bullish scouting party can  set  up camp in enemy  territory  (that is, 
close above resistance for  a few days) then a beachhead  is made.  New, 
fresh  attacking  bull  troops  should  join  the  scouting  party.  The  market 
should move higher. As long as the beachhead is maintained (that is, the 
market  should  hold  the  old  resistance  area  as  new  support),  the  bull

troops will have control of  the market. An example of  a "scouting party" 
is presented in Exhibit 11.21. 

In late May, there were highs made at $3.54. Numerous bull scouting 
parties  tried  to get a foothold into  the bear's  terrain above $3.54.  They 
only succeeded in pushing prices above $3.54 intra-day. The bulls could 
not  get  a  beachhead,  that  is,  a  close,  into  the  bears  terrain.  The  bulls 
then  went  into  retreat.  The  result?  A  return  to  the  bottom  end  of  the 
congestion  band  near $3.45.  A  candlestick  sign  that  the bears still  had 
control of  the  market was  the bearish  engulfing  pattern  made  in  early 
June. The  shooting  stars  on  June 12  and  13  did  not  help  the  picture 
either. 

A bullish scouting party  also transpired  in early April. By  failing to 
hold above the mid-March highs, the bulls had to retreat. The result was 
a retest of  the late March lows. This failure was confirmed by a bearish 
shooting star.

THE  CHANGE OF POLARITY PRINCIPLE 

The Japanese have a  saying that,  "a  red lacquer  dish  needs  no decora- 
tion." This concept of  simple beauty is the essence of  a technical princi- 
ple  I  frequently use  with  candlestick  charting.  It  is  as  simple  as  it  is 
powerful-old  support becomes  new resistance; old  resistance becomes 
support.  This is  what  I  call  the "change  of  polarity" principle.  Exhibit 
11.22  shows  support  converting  to  resistance.  Exhibit  11.23 illustrates 
prior  resistance becoming new  support.  The  potency of  this  change  of 
polarity is proportional  to: 

1.  the  number  of  times  the  old  support/resistance  levels  have  been 

tested; and 

2.  the volume and/or open interest on each test. 

The  concept  behind  the  change  of  polarity  principle  (although  not 
traditionally called that) is an axiom discussed in any basic book on tech- 
nical analysis.  Yet,  it is an  under  utilized gem.  To  see  how  universally 
well this rule works let us briefly look at some examples across the var- 
ious time horizons and markets. 

Exhibit 11.24 shows four occasions in which old resistance converted 
to  new  support.  Exhibit 11.25 shows  how  the lows from  late 1987 and 
mid-1988 became  an  important  resistance zone  for  all  of  1989.  Exhibit 
11.26  illustrates  how  the  old  resistance level  near  27,000  in 1987,  once 
penetrated, becomes significant support in 1988. 

To  round  out  the  time horizon  (we saw  this  rule in  the  prior exam- 
ples with a daily,  weekly and monthly chart) let us look at an intra-day 
chart  (see Exhibit 11.27). From  early  to  mid-July, it  was  obvious where 
the resistance level set in-at  $.72. Once penetrated on July 23,  this $.72 
immediately  converted  to  support.  Once  the  July 24  and  25  highs  of 
$.7290 were breached,  that level also converted to support. 

Exhibit 11.28 shows  the  usefulness of  the change of  polarity princi- 
ple. In late 1989 to early 1990 there was a substantial  rally.  For  the first 
half  of  1990,  the market traded in a lateral band with support shown as

EXHIBIT 11.28.  Orange Juice-Weekly (Change of Polarity) 

a  dotted  line  near  $1.85.  When  this  level  was  breached  in  June 1990, 
what was next support? The price action from $1.25 to $2.05 was essen- 
tially straight up so there was no support evident based on the late 1989 
to  early 1990  rally.  Yet,  when  $1.85 broke,  support  was  expected  near 
$1.65. Where did I get that figure? Two reasons. The first was that a 50% 
correction of  the prior  $.80 rally was near $1.65.  The second,  and more 
important reason, was the prior resistance at area A was also near $1.65. 
That  should  mean it  will  now  be  support.  A series of  limit-down days 
comprised the June selloff. This selloff stopped at $1.66. 

Pick up just about any chart, be it intra-day,  daily, weekly, or longer 
and  the chances are  high  that  you  will  see examples of  this  change  of 
polarity in action. Why is something so simple so good? The reason has 
to  do with  the  raison  d'@tre of  technical analysis;  to  measure  the  emo- 
tions and actions of  the trading and investing community. Thus, the bet- 
ter a technical tool measures behavior, the better that tool should work. 
And  the change of  polarity principle is so successful because it is based 
on sound trading psychological principles. What are these principles? It 
has  to  do  with  how  people  react  when  the  market  goes  against  their 
position or when they believe they may miss a market move. 

Ask  yourself what  is  the  most important  price  on  any  chart? Is  the 

Candlesticks with Trendlines 

205 

highs made for  move? The lows? Yesterday's  close? No. The most  impor- 
tant  price  on  any  chart  is  the  price  at  which  you  entered  the  market.  People 
become  strongly,  keenly  and  emotionally  attached  to  the  price  at  which  they 
bought or  sold. 

Consequently, the more trading that transpires at a certain price area 
the more people are emotionally committed to that level. What does this 
have  to  do  with  the  fact  that  old  resistance becomes  support  and  old 
support becomes resistance? Let  us look  at the Exhibit 11.29 to  answer 
this.  In  late  December,  a  steep  selloff  culminated  at  $5.33  (at  A).  On 
another test of  this level, there are at least three groups who would con- 
sider buying. 

Group 1 would be those who were waiting for the market to stabilize 
after  the  prior  selloff  and  who  now  have  a  point  at  which  the  market 
found  support-$5.33 (the December  28  lows  at  area  A).  A  few  days 
later,  a  successful  test  (at  B)  of  this  support  probably  pulled  in  new 
longs. 

Group 2  would be those who were previously long but were stopped 
out during  the late December selloff. On rally  B  to  B1,  in mid-January, 
some of  these old longs who were stopped out would say to themselves 
that they were right about silver being in a bull market. They just timed 
there original purchase incorrectly.  Now is  the time to buy. They want 
to be  vindicated in  their original view. They wait for  a pullback to sup- 
port at C to go long again. 

Group 3 would be those who bought at points A and B.  They also see 
the B to B,  rally and may want to add to their position if  they get a "good 
price." At area C,  they have their good price since the market is at sup- 
port.  Thus  more buyers  come in at  C.  Then  for  good  measure another 
pullback to D draws in more longs. 

Then the problems start for  the longs. In late February, prices punc- 
ture support areas A,  B,  C,  and D. Anyone who bought at this old sup- 
port area is now in a losing trade. They will want to get out of  their trade 
with the least damage. Rallies to where the longs bought (around $5.33), 
will  be  gratefully  used  by  them  to  exit  their  longs.  Thus,  the  original 
buyers at areas A,  B,  C, and D may now become sellers. This is the main 
reason why old support becomes new resistance. 

Those who decided not to liquidate their losing long positions on the 
minor  rallies in early March then had  to go through  the  pain of  watch- 
ing the market fall  to $5.  They  used  the next rally, in early April (Area 
E),  to exit. Exhibit 11.29 illustrates how support can become resistance. 
The  same  rationale,  but  in  reverse,  is  the  reason  why  resistance  often 
becomes  support.  Do  not  let  the  simplicity  of  the  rule  fool  you.  It 
works-especially  when  melded  with  candlestick indicators.  For  exam- 
ple look at area E.  Notice how the doji after a tall white real body meant

trouble.  This  candlestick  signal coincided  with  the  resistance line. The 
same scenario unfolds at F. 

In  Exhibit 11.30,  the  highs at  A  and  B  then  became support  in  late 
1986 and then in 1989.  Note how the strength of  this support was con- 
firmed twice in 1989 by two consecutive hammer lines. 

In September and early October,  at areas  A  and  B in  Exhibit 11.31, 
the  market  maintained  a  support  level  near  $1,230.  Once  the  bears 
pulled  the  market under  that level on October 9,  this $1,230  then  con- 
verted  to  a  band  of  resistance.  After  the  first  failure  at  this  new  resis- 
tance,  at  C,  prices  descended  until  the  bullish  engulfing  pattern.  A 
minor  rally  then  followed. This  rally  stalled,  once  again,  at  the $1,230 
level. In addition,  there was a dark-cloud cover.

CANDLESTICKS WITH 
RETRACEMENT LEVELS 

%?1%WWB$Uh !I 
"All  things come to those who wait" 

Markets usually  do  not  trend  straight  up,  nor  do  they  fall  vertically 
downward. They usually retrace some of  the advance, or decline, before 
resuming  the prior trend. Some of  the more  popular  retracement levels 
are the 50% level and the Fibonacci figures of  38% and 62% (see Exhib- 
its  12.1  and  12.2).  Fibonacci  was  a  13th  century  mathematician  who 
derived  a  special sequence  of  numbers.  Without getting into  too  much 
detail,  by  comparing  these  numbers  to  one  another  one  could  derive 
what is called-not surprisingly-the Fibonacci ratios. These ratios include 
61.8% (or its inverse of  1.618) and 38.2% (or its inverse of  2.618). This is 
why the 62% (61.8% rounded off) and the 38% (38.2% rounded off) cor- 
rections are  so  popular. The  popular 50% correction is also a Fibonacci 
ratio. The 50% retracement is probably the most widely monitored level. 
This is  because  the 50% retracement  is  used  by  those  who  use  Gann, 
Elliott Wave,  or Dow Theory. 

Exhibit 12.3 illustrates how well retracements can help predict resis- 
tance areas in a bear market. The 50% retracements in gold over the past 
few years have become significant resistance levels. Let  us look at three 
instances on this chart where 50% retracements melded with candlestick 
techniques to provide important top reversal signals. 

Xetracement  1-The  highs  at  A  in  late 1987  ($502) were  made  by  a 
bearish  engulfing  pattern.  The  selloff  which  began  in  late 1987  ended 
with a piercing pattern at B at $425. Based on a 50% retracement of  this 
selloff  from  A  to  B,  resistance should  occur  at $464  (this is  figured  by 
taking half  the difference  between  the  high  at  A  and  the low at  B  and

adding this onto the low at B).  Thus, at $464 you look for resistance and 
confirmation of  resistance with a bearish candlestick indicator. A bearish 
engulfing pattern formed at C.  At  C,  the high was $469  or within $5 of 
the 50% correction. The market began its next leg lower. 

Retracement  2-The  selloff  which  began  at  C  ended  at  the  morning 
star  pattern at D. Taking a 50% correction from  C's  high at $469  to D's 
low at $392  gives a  resistance  area  of  $430.  Thus,  at  that  level,  bearish 
candlestick  confirmation  should  appear.  Gold  reached  $433  at  area  E. 
During this time (the weeks of  November 28 and December 5 (at E)) gold 
came within $.50 of  making a bearish engulfing pattern. Another decline 
started from E. 

Retracement 3-From  the high at E  to  the low at F in 1989  (at $357), 
prices fell $76.  (Interestingly,  all three selloffs,  A  to B,  C to D,  and E  to 
F fell  about  $77.) There  were  no  candlestick  indicators  that  called  the 
lows on June 5. The second  test of  these lows in September came via  a 
hammerlike line. 

The next resistance level,  a 50% retracement of  the decline from E  to 
F,  is $395.  Not  too  surprisingly  gold  surpassed  this  level.  Why  wasn't 
this a surprise? Because, in late 1989,  gold pierced a two-year  resistance

line. In addition,  gold built a solid base in 1989 by forming a double bot- 
tom at the $357 level. Thus, we have to look out farther to a 50% retrace- 
ment  of  the  larger  move.  This  means  a  50% retracement  of  the  entire 
decline from  the 1987  high  (area A)  to  the 1989  low  (area F). This fur- 
nishes  a  resistance  level  of  $430.  Near  this  $430  level,  at  $425  on  the 
week  of  November  20  at  area  G,  the  market  gave  two  signs  that  the 
uptrend was in trouble. Those signs were a harami pattern and, as part 
of  this pattern, a hanging man. A few weeks later, on the week of  Janu- 
ary  22,  the  highs  for  this  move  were  touched  at  $425.  The  following 
week's  price  action  created  another  hanging  man.  Gold  declined  from 
there. 

Look at Exhibit 12.4. The combination tweezers and harami bottom at 
$18.58 (A) was the start of  a $3.50  rally. This rally terminated  at $22.15 
(B)  with a bearish engulfing pattern. A 50% correction of  the A-B  thrust 
would  mean support near $20.36. At  area  C,  a bullish piercing pattern 
formed at $20.15. The market then had a minor rally from C. This rally 
ran  into  problems  because of  the  dark-cloud cover  at  D.  Interestingly, 
D's  high  at $21.25 was within 10  ticks of  a 50% bounce  from  the  prior 
downleg K C .  

Exhibit 12.5 reveals that a Fibonacci 62% retracement of  rally A-B  is

$5.97.  This also coincides closely with the old  resistance level from late 
January and February at $5.95. That old resistance converted to support. 
On the pullback to  this level,  on  April 2 and 3,  this $5.97 held  as sup- 
port. These sessions formed a harami pattern that signaled an end to the 
prior minor downmove. Then,  just for good measure, there was an addi- 
tional test of  this support in mid-April, and away went the beans! 

Exhibit 12.6a shows from crude oil's July low at L,  to its October high 
at H,  there was a $21.70 rally. A 50% retracement of  this rally would  be 
at $29.05. Thus,  based on the theory  that a 50% retracement level from 
a rally should be support, we should look for a bullish candlestick indi- 
cator near that $29.05 area on the brisk selloff from October's  high. This 
is what unfolded. On October 23, after prices touched a low of  $28.30,  a 
hammer  developed on the daily chart. The market rallied over $5 from 
that  hammer.  On the intra-day  chart  of  the  price action  on  October 23 
(see Exhibit  12.6b) we see the first hour's  action also formed a hammer. 
Thus, the daily candlestick chart on October 23 and the first hour on the 
intra-day  candlestick chart  on October  23 both  had  hammers.  This is a 
rare,  and as we see, significant occurrence. Note how,  on the intra-day 
chart,  the brisk rally that began with  the hammer  ran out of  force  with 
the emergence of  the hanging man on October 26. 

CANDLESTICKS WITH 
MOVING AVERAGES 

+At-$ 
"Ten Men, Ten  Tastes" 

T h e  moving average is one of the oldest and most popular tools used by 
technicians. Its strength  is as a  trend-following device which  offers the 
technician  the  ability  to  catch  major  moves.  Thus,  it  is  utilized  most 
effectively  in  trending  markets.  However,  since  moving  averages  are 
lagging indicators they can catch a trend only after it has turned. 

THE  SIMPLE MOVING  AVERAGE 

The most basic of  the moving averages is,  as the name implies, the sim- 
ple  moving  average.  This is  the average of all  the  price  points  used.  For 
example, let us say that the last five gold closing prices were $380,  $383, 
$394, $390, and $382. The five-day moving average of  these closes would 
be 

The general formula is: 

where P1  =  the most recent price 

P2  =  the second most recent price and so on 

n  =  the number of  data points 

216 

The Rule of  Multiple Technical Techniques 

The term "moving" in  moving average is applicable because,  as the 
newest data is added to the moving average, the oldest data is dropped. 
Consequently,  the average is always moving as  the  new data is added. 
As  seen  in  the  simple  moving  average  example  above,  each  day's 
gold  price contributed  1 ,  to  the  total  moving average  (since this  was a 
five-day moving average). A  nine-day  moving average means that each 
day will only be % of  the total moving average. Consequently,  the longer 
the moving average,  the less impact an individual  price will  have on it. 
The shorter the term of  the moving average,  the closer it will "hug" 
prices. This is a plus insofar as it is more sensitive to recent price action. 
The  negative  aspect  is  that  it  has  a  greater  potential  for  whipsaws. 
Longer-term  moving  averages  provide  a  greater  smoothing  effect,  but 
are less responsive to recent prices. 

The  more  popular  moving  averages  include  the  four- , nine- , and 
18-day averages for shorter-term traders and the 13- , 26- , and 40-week 
moving averages for position players. The 13- and 40-week moving aver- 
ages are  popular  in Japan. The spectrum  of  moving average  users  runs 
from the intra-day trader, who uses moving averages of  real-time trades, 
to the hedger who may focus on monthly, or even yearly, moving aver- 
ages. 

Other  than  the length  of  the average,  another  avenue of  analysis is 
based on what price is used to compute the average. Most moving aver- 
age systems  use,  as  we  did  in  our  gold  example,  closing  prices.  How- 
ever,  moving  averages  of  highs,  lows,  and  the  mid-point  of  the  highs 
and  lows  have  all  been  used.  Sometimes,  moving  averages  of  moving 
averages are even used. 

THE  WEIGHTED MOVING  AVERAGE 

A weighted  moving average assigns a different weight to each price used to 
compute  the  average.  Almost  all  weighted  moving  averages  are  front 
loaded. That is,  the  most  recent  prices are weighted  more heavily than 
older prices. How the data is weighted is a matter of  preference. 

THE  EXPONENTIAL MOVING  AVERAGE 
AND THE  MACD 

The exponential moving average is a special type of  weighted moving aver- 
age.  Like  the  basic  weighted  moving  average,  the  exponential  moving 

Candlesticks with Moving Averages 

217 

average  is  front  weighted.  Unlike  other  moving  averages,  though,  the 
exponential  moving  average  incorporates  all  prior  prices  used  in  the 
data. This type of  moving average assigns progressively smaller weights 
to each of  the past prices. Each weight is exponentially smaller than the 
previous weight,  hence,  the name exponential moving average. 

One of  the most  popular  uses of  the exponential moving average  is 
for  use in  the  MACD  (Moving Average  Convergence-Divergence). The 
MACD is composed of  two lines. The first line is the difference between 
two exponential  moving  averages  (usually the  26-  and 12-period  expo- 
nential moving averages). The second line of  the MACD is made by tak- 
ing an exponential moving average (usually a 9 period) of  the difference 
between  the  two  exponential  moving  averages  used  to  make  the  first 
line. This second line is called  the  signal  line.  More about  the MACD in 
Exhibits 13.7 and 13.8. 

HOW TO USE MOVING AVERAGES 

Moving  averages  can  provide  objective  strategies  with  clearly  defined 
trading  rules.  Many  of  the  computerized  technical trading  systems  are 
underpinned  on moving averages.  How can moving averages be  used? 
The answer  to this is as varied as  there are  different trading  styles and 
philosophies.  Some  of  the  more  prevalent  uses  of  the  moving  average 
include: 

1.  Comparing the price versus the moving averages as a trend indicator. 
For  instance,  a  good  gauge  to see if  a  market  is in  an  intermediate- 
term  uptrend  could be  that prices have to be above the 65-day mov- 
ing  average.  For  a  longer-term  uptrend  prices  would  have  to  be 
higher than the 40-week moving average. 

2.  Using  the  moving  average  as  support  or  resistance  levels.  A  close 
above the specified moving average would be bullish.  A close below 
the moving average would be bearish. 

3.  Monitoring the moving average band (also known as envelopes). These 
bands  are  a  certain  percentage  above  or  below  the  moving  average 
and can serve as support or  resistance. 

4.  Watching the slope of  the moving average.  For instance, if  the mov- 
ing average levels off  or declines after a period of  a sustained  rise, it 
may be a bearish signal. Drawing trendlines on the moving averages 
is a simple method of  monitoring their slope. 

5.  Trading  with  a  dual  moving  average  system.  This  is  addressed  in 

detail later in this chapter.

The Rule of  Multiple Technical Techniques 

The examples that follow use various moving averages. They are not 
based  on  optimum  moving  averages.  An  optimum  moving  average 
today might  not  be  the  optimum  one  tomorrow.  The  moving averages 
used in this text are widely monitored along with some which are not as 
widely  used  but which  are based  on such  tools as  Fibonacci  numbers. 
The  moving  averages  used  here  are  not  the  important  point.  What  is 
meaningful is how moving averages can be melded with candlesticks. 

I like using the 65-day moving average as a broad  spectrum moving 
average.  From  my  experience,  it  seems  to  work  well  in  many  of  the 
futures markets.  Exhibit 13.1 illustrates  a  65-day  moving  average  that 
offered  support  to  the  market  at  areas 1,  2,  and  3.  Beside  the  moving 
average shoring up the market at these  points,  we see a bullish engulf- 
ing pattern at area 1, a hammer and harami at 2,  and another  hammer- 
like line at 3. 

Exhibit 13.2  reveals  that a  confluence of  technical  factors  joined  on 
April 2 and 3 to warn alert eyes of  trouble ahead. Let  us take a look at 
the specifics: 

1.  In early March, prices broke under the 65-day moving average. From 

that point, the moving average became resistance.

2.  The two candlesticks on April 2 and 3 formed a dark-cloud cover. This 
dark-cloud cover was also a failure at the moving average's  resistance 
area. 

3.  April  3 was  not  only  a  dark-cloud  cover  and  a  failure  at  a  moving

DUAL MOVING AVERAGES 

There are many ways two moving averages can be used. One way is as 
an overbought/oversold indicator or oscillator. This indicator is obtained 
by  subtracting  the  shorter-term  moving  average  from  the  longer-term 
moving average. This indicator  has plus or  minus values.  Thus a value 
above 0 means the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term 
moving average. Anything under 0 means the shorter-term moving aver- 
age is less  than  the longer-term  moving average.  In  doing this,  we are 
comparing the short-term momentum to a longer-term momentum. This 
is because, as discussed  earlier,  the short-term moving average is more 
responsive  to  recent  price activity. If  the short-term  moving  average  is 
relatively far above (or below), the longer-term moving average, the mar- 
ket is said to be overbought (or oversold). 

Another  use  of 

two  moving  averages  is  to  monitor  crossovers 
between the short-term and longer-term moving averages. If  the shorter- 
term  moving average crosses  the longer-term  moving average,  it  could 
be  an  early  warning  of  a  trend  change.  An  example  would  be  if  a 
shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term  moving  aver- 

 
 
 
 
Candlesticks with Moving  Averages  221 

age. This is a bullish signal. In Japan, such a moving average crossover 
is  called  a  golden  cross.  Thus,  if  the  three-day  moving  average  crosses 
above the nine-day  moving average it is a golden  cross.  A dead  cross  in 
Japan is  the opposite.  It  is a  bearish indication  which  occurs when  the 
shorter-term  moving  average  crosses  under  the  longer-term  moving 
average. 

For  a  short-term  overbought/oversold  indicator,  some  technicians 
monitor the current close in relation to the five-day moving average. (See 
Exhibit 13.4.) For  instance,  if  copper's  five-day moving average is $1.10 
and  today's  close  is  $1.14,  copper  would  be  $.04  overbought.  In  this 
example, the lower graph's  line is made up of  the five-day moving aver- 
age  subtracted  from  the  current  close.  As  can  be  seen  from  this chart, 
when this dual moving average line gets about 400  points (that is,  $.04) 
overbought  the market become vulnerable-especially with bearish can- 
dlestick confirmation. At time period 1, an overbought reading coincided 
with a harami; at period 2,  it hit another harami; at 3, it hit a doji; and at 
4,  it  hit  another  harami.  A market can  relieve its  overbought  condition 
by selling off  or by trading sideways. In this example, time periods 1 and 
3 relieved the overbought situation by easing into a lateral band. Periods 
2 and 4 saw selloffs. Overbought markets usually should not be shorted.

Instead,  they should  be used  by longs to take defensive  measures. The 
reverse is true in oversold markets. 

Two moving averages can be plotted as two lines overlaid on a price 
chart. As previously mentioned, when the shorter-term moving average 
crosses above a longer-term moving average it is called a golden cross by 
the Japanese and is a bullish indication. Exhibit 13.5 has a bullish golden 
cross and a fry  pan bottom. The fry  pan bottom  was confirmed by  the 
window  on  July 2.  Note  how  the  window  became  support in  the  first 
half  of  July and  how the shorter-term moving average became  support 
as the market rallied. 

Dual moving average differences are also used as a divergence vehi- 
cle.  As prices increase,  the technician wants to see the short-term mov- 
ing  average  increase  relative  to  the  longer-term  moving  average.  This 
would mean increasing positive values for the moving average difference 
line.  If  prices advance  and  the difference between the short- and  long- 
term moving averages narrows, the market is indicating that the shorter- 
term  momentum  is  running out of  steam.  This suggests an end  to  the 
price advance. 

In Exhibit 13.6, we have a histogram  between  two moving averages. 
During  time  periods  1 and  2,  advancing  prices  were  echoed  by  a

widening  differential  between  the  short-  and  long-term  moving  aver- 
ages.  This  means  the  shorter-term  moving  average  is  increasing  more 
quickly than the longer-term moving average. This bodes well for a con- 
tinuation of  the uptrend. Time period 3 is where the market experienced 
problems.  The  $.50 rally,  which began  February 23,  was mirrored  by  a 
narrowing of  the moving average differential. This reflects a weakening 
of  the short-term momentum. Add to this the dark-cloud cover and you 
have a market vulnerable to a price pullback. 

The  histogram  also  displays  when  the  short-term  moving  average 
crosses above or below the longer-term moving average. When the his- 
togram is below 0,  the short-term moving average is under the long-term 
average.  When  it  is above 0,  the  short-term average is above  the long- 
term  moving average. Thus,  an oscillator reading under  0 represents  a 
bearish dead cross; above 0 would be a bullish golden cross. 

There  was a  golden  cross  at  time  frame A.  A  few  days  before  this 
golden  cross  there  was  a  bullish inverted  hammer.  At  B,  there  was  a 
dead cross. At time frame C,  prices had rallied but the short-term mov- 
ing average  could  not  get  back  above  the  longer-term  moving  average 
(that is,  the  oscillator  remained  under  0).  In  addition,  a  bearish  signal 
was sent when the dark-cloud cover formed on April 2 and 3.

The  MACD  has  two  lines.  They  are  shown  on  the  lower  chart  in 
Exhibit 13.7. The more volatile solid line is the signal line.  A sell signal 
occurs when this signal line crosses below the dashed, less volatile line. 
In  this  example,  the  bearish  implications of  the  two  bearish  engulfing 
patterns were corroborated by the bearish crossovers of  the MACD indi- 
cators (see arrows). 

In Exhibit 13.8, the signal line of the MACD pushed above the slower 
moving line in  early July (see arrow). This  was  a  notable  clue  that  the 
market  might be bottoming.  Shifting to the candlesticks shows that the 
first  morning  star's  bullish implications were  voided  by  the dark-cloud 
cover. The price decline from this dark-cloud cover ended with another 
morning  star.  After  a  temporary  set  back  with  the  hanging  man,  the 
market's  upward force gained steam. 

CANDLESTICKS 
WITH OSCILLATORS 

f#+e-rtFlB  h if 
"Let every bird  sing its own  note" 

Pattern recognition techniques  are  often subjective  (this includes  can- 
dlestick  techniques).  Oscillators are  mathematically  derived  techniques 
which offer  a  more  objective  means  of  analyzing  the  market.  They  are 
widely used and are the basis of many computerized trading systems. 

OSCILLATORS 

Oscillators  include  such  technical  tools  as  the  relative  strength  index, 
stochastics, and momentum. 

As  discussed  in  greater  depth  later  in  this  chapter,  oscillators  can 

serve traders in at least three ways: 

1.  Oscillators  can  be  used  as  divergence indicators  (that is,  when  the 
price and the oscillator move in different directions). They can warn 
that  the current  price  trend  may be  stalling. There are  two  kinds of 
divergence. A negative, or bearish, divergence occurs when prices are at 
a new high,  but the oscillator is not. This implies the market is inter- 
nally weak. A positive, or bullish, divergence is when prices are at a new 
low  but  the oscillator does  not  hit  a  new  low.  The  implications are 
that the selling pressure is losing steam. 

228  The Rule of  Multiple Technical Techniques 

2.  As overboughtloversold indicators,  oscillators can notify the trader if 
the market  has become overextended and,  thus,  vulnerable  to a cor- 
rection.  Using  an  oscillator  as  an  overbought/oversold  indicator 
requires caution. Because of  how they are constructed, oscillators are 
mainly applied in lateral price environments. Using an oscillator as an 
overboughtloversold  indicator  when  a  new  major  trend  is  about  to 
commence can cause problems. If, for example, there is a break above 
the top of  a congestion band, it could indicate the start of  a new bull 
leg and the oscillator could stay overbought while prices ascend. 
3.  Oscillators can confirm the force behind a trend's move by measuring 
the market's momentum. Momentum measures the velocity of  a price 
move  by  comparing  price  changes.  In  theory,  the  velocity  should 
increase as the trend is underway.  A flattening  of  momentum  could 
be an early warning that a price move may be decelerating. 

Use oscillator signals to place a position in the direction of  the domi- 
nant trend. Thus, a bullish oscillator indication should be used to buy, if 
the major  trend is up,  and  to  cover shorts,  if  the  major  trend is down. 
The same idea applies to a sell signal vis-a-vis an oscillator. Do not short 
on  a  bearish  oscillator  signal  unless  the  prevailing  trend  is  heading 
south. If  it is not, a bearish oscillator signal should  be  used to liquidate 
longs. 

THE  RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX 

The  Relative  Strength  Index  (RSI)'  is  one  of  the  most  popular  technical 
tools used  by  futures  traders.  Many charting  services plot  the  RSI  and 
many traders closely monitor it.  The RSI  compares the relative strength 
of  price advances  to price declines over a specified period.  Nine and 14 
days are some of  the most popular periods used. 

How to Compute the RSI 

The RSI is figured by comparing the gains of  up sessions to the losses of 
the  down  sessions  over  a  given  time  frame. The  calculations used  are 
dependent only on closing prices. The formula is: 

RSI  = 100  -  (1  %S) 

where RS  = average up points for periodlaverage down points for 

period 

Candlesticks with Oscillators 

229 

Thus, computing a 14-day RSI entails adding the total gains made on 
the up days over the last 14 days (on a close-to-close basis) and dividing 
by 14.  The same would  be done for  the down days. These figures  pro- 
vide the relative strength, (RS). This RS is then put into the RSI formula. 
This RSI  formula converts  the RS  data so that it becomes an index with 
a range between 0 and 100. 

How to Use RSI 

The two main  uses of  RSI  are as an  overbought/oversold  indicator  and 
as a tool to monitor divergences. 

As an overbought/oversold indicator, the RSI implies that the market 
is overbought if  it approaches the upper end of  this band (that is,  above 
70  or 80). At  that  point,  the  market may be vulnerable  to a  pullback or 
could move into a period of  consolidation. Conversely, at the lower end 
of  the RSI range (usually below 30  or 20), it is said to reflect an oversold 
condition. In such an environment,  there is a potential of  a short cover- 
ing move. 

As  a  divergence  tool,  RSI  calculations can  be  helpful  when  prices 
make a  new  high for  the  move  and  the  RSI  fails  to  make  a  concurrent 
high.  This is called a  negative divergence and  is  potentially  bearish.  A 
positive  divergence  occurs  when  prices  make  a  new  low,  but  the  RSI 
does not. Divergences are more meaningful when RSI oscillator readings 
are in overbought or oversold regions. 

Exhibit 14.1 displays  both  a  bullish  positive  and  a  bearish  negative 
RSI  divergence which  helped these candlestick readings.  At  the time of 
the January 24  price low,  the RSI  was 28%. On January 31,  a new price 
low for the move occurred. The RSI  then was 39%. This was noticeably 
higher  than  the  28% RSI  value  of  January 24.  New  price  lows  and  a 
higher  RSI  level created  a bullish positive divergence.  Besides the posi- 
tive  divergence,  the  white  line  of  January 31  engulfed  the  prior  black 
candlestick. This built a bullish engulfing pattern. 

A doji star arose on March 14. The next session created a candlestick 
similar to a hanging man.  (The lower shadow was not long enough for 
it to be a classic hanging man,  though.) At the time of  these potentially 
bearish  candlestick indicators,  the  RSI  was also sending out a  warning 
alert. Specifically, the new price peaks of  March 15 and 16 were mirrored 
by lower RSI  readings. This is bearish  negative divergence.  The market 
made  another  price  surge  on  March  21,  and  although  this  was  a  new 
price high,  RSI  levels continued to decline. The result was a pullback to 
the March support area of  $1.11. 

In Exhibit 14.2 the decline that began with the bearish engulfing pat-

tern stopped at the piercing pattern. The constructive outlook implied by 
this  piercing  pattern  was  reinforced  by  the  positive  divergence  of  the 
RSI. Some technicians also use trendlines with RSI. In this case,  the RSI 
uptrend support line held in spite of  new price lows on March 29. 

Exhibit 14.2 illustrates another reason to use candlesticks as a compli- 
ment to the RSI.  Candlesticks may give a bullish or bearish signal before 
the  additional  confirmation sometimes  needed  by  the RSI. Specifically, 
some technicians will view the RSI as giving a bullish signal if  two steps 
occur.  The  first is  the  aforementioned  positive divergence.  The  next  is 
that  the  RSI  has  to  move  above  its  prior  high.  In  this  example,  that 
would mean a move above the April 20 RSI level (A). Based on this pro- 
cedure the bullish signal would have been given at point B.  However, by 
joining  the  bullish  candlestick indication  (the engulfing  line)  with  the 
RSI's  positive divergence, the bullish signal would have been apparent a 
few days earlier. 

Doji  are  a  warning  signal  during  uptrends.  But,  like  all  technical 
clues,  they can sometimes  mislead you.  One way  to filter  out the  mis- 
leading clues is  to add  other  technical tools.  Exhibit 14.3 illustrates  the 
use of  the RSI as a tool of  confirmation. A bearish shooting star and a set 
of  doji lines appeared  in the middle  of  May  (time frame  A). These  sig-

naled  the  end of  the  prior  uptrend,  at  least  temporarily,  as  the  market 
moved into a lateral range for  the next few weeks.  After  this  respite,  a 
rally pushed  prices to new highs at time frame B.  These highs were 100 
points above where they were at time frame A. Yet,  at time frame B,  the 
RSI was where it was at A. This reflected a flagging of  the markets inter- 
nal strength. The harami at B sounded  more warning sirens. 

After  a 100-point  setback  from  the  highs  at  time  frame  B,  another 
rally  ensued.  This  rally  touched  the 3000  level  at  time  frame  C.  These 
new  highs  were  sharply  above  prices at  time frame  B  but the  RSI  was 
noticeably  less.  This  bearish  divergence  at  time  frame  C  accompanied 
with  the  shooting  star,  the  doji,  and  the  hanging  man  indicated  the 
internally weak structure of  the market, even though prices touched new 
highs. 

STOCHASTICS 

The  stochastic  oscillator  is  another  popular  tool  used  by  futures  techni- 
cians.  As  an  oscillator,  it  provides  overbought  and  oversold  readings, 
signals divergences, and affords a mechanism to compare a shorter-term 
trend  to a longer-term  trend. The stochastic indicator compares  the lat- 
est  closing  price  with  the  total  range  of  price  action  for  a  specified 
period. Stochastic values are between 0 and 100. A high-stochastic read- 
ing would  mean the close is near the upper end  of  the entire range for 
the period. A low reading means that the close is near the low end of  the 
period's  range. The idea behind stochastics is that, as the market moves 
higher,  closes tend  to be  near  the highs of  the  range  or,  as  the  market 
moves lower,  prices tend to cluster near the lows of  the range. 

How to Compute Stochastics 

The stochastic indicator is comprised  of  two  lines;  the  %K and  the  %D 
lines.  The  %K line,  called  the  raw  stochastic  or  the  fast  %K,  is  the  most 
sensitive. The formula for the  %K line is: 

(Close) - (Low of N) 
(High of  N)  - (Low of  N) 

x  100  =  %K 

where  Close  = current close 

Low  of  N  = low of  the range during the period used 
High of  N  =  high of  the range during the period used 

Candlesticks with Oscillators 

233 

The "100"  in the equation converts the value into a percentage. Thus,  if 
the close today is the same as the high for the period under observation, 
the  fast  %K would  be 100%. A period  can  be  in  days,  weeks,  or  even 
intra-day  (such as hourly). Nineteen,  fourteen,  and  twenty-one  periods 
are some of  the more common periods. 

Because  the  fast  %K line  can  be  so  volatile,  this  line  is  usually 
smoothed by taking a moving average of  the last three  %K values.  This 
three-period  moving average of  %K is called  the slow %K. .Most techni- 
cians use the slow %K line instead of  the choppy fast %K line. This slow 
%K is  then  smoothed  again  using  a  three-day  moving  average  of  the 
slow %K to get what is called the %D line. This %D is essentially a mov- 
ing  average  of  a  moving  average.  One  way  to  think  of  the  difference 
between the %K and  %D lines is too view them as you would two mov- 
ing averages with  the  %K line comparable to a short-term moving aver- 
age and the  %D line comparable to a longer-term moving average. 

How to Use Stochastics 

As mentioned previously, stochastics can be used a few ways. The most 
popular  method  is  to  view  it  as  a  tool  for  showing  divergence.  Most 
technicians  who  monitor  stochastics  use  this  aspect  of  divergence  in 
conjunction with overbought/oversold readings. 

Some technicians require another rule. That rule is  to have the slow 
%K line cross under the  %D line for a sell signal, or for the slow  %K to 
move above the  %D for a busy signal. This is comparable to the bullish 
(bearish) signal  of  a  faster  moving  average  crossing  over  (under) the 
slower  moving  average.  For  instance,  to  get  a  buy  signal,  the  market 
must  be  oversold  (25% or  less  for  %D), there  is  a  positive  divergence 
and, the  %K line is crossing above the  %D line. 

Looking at Exhibit 14.4,  the doji session of  January 3 should give you 
pause. A doji following a long white candlestick "ain't  pretty." The doji 
session  made  new  price  highs  as  they  pushed  above  the  December 
highs.  But  stochastics did  not  echo these  price  highs  with  concomitant 
highs, so this was bearish negative divergence. It was an important affir- 
mation of  the bearish signal sent on the doji day. 

Besides  the  divergence,  some  technicians look for  crossovers  of  the 
%K and  %D lines. See Exhibit 14.5. In mid-1989, copper based out via a 
hammer. Another series of hammer lines materialized in early 1990. Was 
this a sign of  another base? The answer was more than likely yes because 
of  what the stochastic evidence told us. Hammer B made new lows as it 
broke  under  the  lows  from  hammer  A.  Yet,  at  hammer  B  there  was a 
higher  stochastic reading than at  hammer A. This was a  positive diver- 
gence. The implications were an abating of  selling pressure.

There was also a positive crossover as the more volatile, solid %K line 
crossed above the dotted  %D line (see arrow). This crossover is consid- 
ered more significant if  it is from oversold readings (that is,  under 25%). 
That  is  what  occurred  here.  So,  in  early 1990,  there  were  a  series  of 
hammerlike  lines  and  a  positive  divergence  with  a  positive  crossover 
during  an  oversold  market.  A  confluence  of  technical  indicators  that 
were strong clues that the prior downtrend had ended. 

As illustrated  by  Exhibit 14.6,  April 12  and 16  formed  a  dark-cloud 
cover. The black candlestick session on April 16 pushed prices above the 
former highs in March. Thus prices were at a  new high,  but stochastics 
were  not.  The dark-cloud  cover  and  the  negative  divergence  were  two 
signs to be circumspect about further rallies. The next downleg was cor- 
roborated by a negative crossover when the faster %K line crossed under 
the slower  %D line (as shown by the arrow). 

I do not often use candlesticks with British Pound futures because, as 
can be seen in Exhibit 14.7,  many sessions are small real bodies or doji. 
This  is  in  addition  to  the  frequent gaps  induced  by  overnight  trading 
(this is also true of  other currency futures). Nonetheless,  at times,  there 
are  candlestick  signals  that  bear  watching  especially  when  confirmed 
with other  indicator^.^

EXHIBIT 14.7.  British Pound-June 1990,  Daily (Stochastics with Candlesticks) 

During  the  week  of  March 19,  a  variation  of  a  morning  star  arose. 
Normally, it is best if  the third white candlestick of  the morning star pat- 
tern  pushes  well into  the first session's  black body. This white candle- 
stick  did  not.  Before  deciding  how  much  importance  to  place  on  a 
variation of  a  pattern,  scan the other technical evidence.  At  the time of 
the  morning  star  (or  actually  its  variation),  prices  touched  new  price 
lows; stochastics did  not.  This was a bullish  positive divergence  which 
was soon  confirmed when the  %K line crossed over the  %D line. Con- 
sequently,  the  fact  that  the  morning  star  pattern  was  less  than  ideal 
should have only given you temporary pause about calling for a bottom. 
Stochastic indicators provided plenty of  added proof  to this outlook. 

MOMENTUM 

Momentum,  also called  price  velocity,  is a  measurement  of  the  difference 
between the closing price today and the closing price a specified number 
of  days ago. If  we  use a  ten-day momentum  we compare  today's  close 
to  that  of  ten  days  ago.  If  today's  close  is  higher,  the  momentum is  a 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Candlesticks with Oscillators

positive number on the momentum scale. If  today's  close is lower  than 
that  of  ten  days  ago,  the  momentum  is  a  minus  figure.  Using  the 
momentum index, price differences (the difference between today's close 
and that of  whatever  period you  pick) should  rise at an increasing rate 
as a trend progresses. This displays an uptrend with increasingly greater 
momentum. In other words,  the velocity of  the price changes is increas- 
ing. If  prices are rising and momentum  begins to flatten,  a decelerating 
price trend is in effect. This could be an early warning that a prior price 
trend could end. If  the momentum crosses under the 0 line,  it could  be 
construed as a bearish sign, above the 0 line,  as bullish. 

Momentum  is  also  handy  as  an  overbought/oversold indicator.  For 
instance,  when  the  momentum  index  is  at  a  relatively  large  positive 
value the market may be overbought and vulnerable to a price pullback. 
Momentum  usually  hits  its  peak  before  prices.  Based  on  this,  a  very 
overbought momentum oscillator could be  presaging a price peak. 

In Exhibit 14.8, the long-legged doji in January was a warning for the 
longs to be careful. Further reason for caution was that prices produced 
new highs on this doji session, yet the momentum was noticeably lower 
than at  the  prior  high  in  late  November  (A). More  proof  that  a  down- 
trend could start was apparent when the momentum fell under 0 in early 
February.

238 

The Rule of  Multiple Technical Techniques 

EXHIBIT 14.9.  Heating Oil-July 1990,  Daily (Momentum with Candlesticks) 

Another  use of  momentum  is  to provide  a yardstick for  overbought 
or  oversold  levels  (see  Exhibit 14.9). In  this  heating  oil  chart,  observe 
how an oscillator reading of  around  +200  (that is,  the  current  close is 
$.02 above  the  close  ten  days  ago)  represents  an  overbought  environ- 
ment.  An  oversold  state  exists  for  this  market  when  the  momentum 
oscillator is  -400 points or $.04 under the close of  ten days prior. At the 
200-point overbought level, continuation of  the prior rally is unlikely and 
the  market  should  either  trade sideways or  backoff.  The odds of  a  top 
reversal with an overbought momentum reading are increased if  there is 
bearish  candlestick confirmation.  In  this  regard,  in  February  an  over- 
bought  momentum  level  is  coupled  with  an  evening  star  and  then  a 
harami cross. Another overbought oscillator in early April joined another 
evening  star  pattern.  Hammers  A  and  B  accompanied  the  oversold 
momentum  levels in  March  and  April.  At  these  points,  further  selloffs 
were unlikely and either sideways action or rallies could unfold to relieve 
the oversold nature of  the market.

Notes 

'This  RSI is different  than the relative strength used by equity technicians.  The relative strength 
used  by  equity  technicians  compares  the  relative  strength  performance  of  a  stock,  or  a  small 
group of  stocks,  to the performance of broader market index such as the Dow Jones or  the S&P 
500. 
'To  help follow the 24-hour foreign exchange markets some Japanese candlestick  users will draw 
a candlestick  based on the Tokyo  trading session and draw another candlestick  line on the U.S. 
trading session. Thus, for each 24-hour period, there will be two candlesticks.  For those who fol- 
low  the  currency  futures,  the  weekly  candlestick  charts  may  decrease  some  of  the  problems 
caused by overnight  trading. 

CANDLESTICKS WITH 
VOLUME AND OPEN 
INTEREST 

"A  single arrow  is  easily  broken,  but not  ten  in a bundle" 

T h e  theory behind volume states that the greater the volume, the greater 
the  force  behind  the  move.  As  long  as  volume  increases,  the  current 
price  trend  should  continue.  If,  however,  volume  declines  as  a  price 
trend  progresses,  there is less reason to believe that  the trend  will con- 
tinue.  Volume  can  also  be  useful for  confirming  tops  and  bottoms.  A 
light volume test of  a support level suggests a diminution of  selling force 
and is, consequently, bullish. Conversely, a light volume test of  a previ- 
ous high is bearish since it demonstrates a draining of  buying power. 

Although  volume can  be a  useful auxiliary medium  to  measure  the 
intensity of  a price move, there are some factors with volume, especially 
as they pertain to futures, that somewhat limit their usefulness.  Volume 
is  reported  a day late. Spread  trading  may cause aberrations in volume 
figures-especially on  individual  contract  months.  With  the  increasing 
dominance of  options in many futures markets, volume figures could be 
skewed  because  of  option  arbitrage  strategies.  Nonetheless,  volume 
analysis can be a useful tool. This chapter examines some ways volume 
and candlestick charting techniques can be merged. 

242 

The Rule of  Multiple Technical Techniques 

VOLUME WITH CANDLESTICKS 

Exhibit  15.1  shows  how  volume  and  candlestick  techniques  can  help 
confirm  double  tops  or  bottoms.  On  March  22  (line  I),  the  market 
pushed  up  to  the  late  February  highs  near  94.  Volume  at  line 1 was 
504,000  contracts  (all  volume  figures  are  total  volume  for  all  contract 
months). For  the  next few  sessions,  prices tried  to  push above  this 94 
level. The small white real bodies on these days reflected the bulls'  lack 
of  fervor.  The  low  volume  figures  on  these  small  candlestick sessions 
echoed  this.  The bulls  finally surrendered  after a  week.  In  late  March, 
within two days,  the market fell two full points. 

Next we turn our attention to the tall white candlestick of  April 4 (line 
2).  Could  this  strong  session  presage  gathering  strength  by  the  bulls? 
The answer is probably not. First,  we note the volume on this rally ses- 
sion was a relatively light 300,000 contracts. The long black candlesticks 
a few sessions before (March 29 and 30) had larger volume. Another sign 
of  trouble appeared  with  the action following line 2. The next day (line 
3) a  small  real body appeared.  Lines  2 and  3 constituted a harami  pat- 
tern. The implications were  that  the  prior  upmove was  over.  Note also 
that  this small real body  day was also a variation on a bearish  hanging

man  (an ideal  hanging-man  line  is  at  the  top  of  a  trading  range  or  an 
uptrend). The next day,  (line 4) there was a final surge to 94.  This was 
a  portentous  rickshaw man  day.  In  addition,  this  price  push  had  rela- 
tively  little  force  behind  it  as  reflected  by  the  lighter  volume  (379,000 
contracts) compared to the volume on March 22  (504,000 contracts). The 
light volume test at an old high increased the chance this was a double 
top. The move under the March 30  low confirmed this as a double  top. 
This double top gave a minimum measured target of  90. 

We  saw  how a light volume test  of a high could  signal a  top,  espe- 
cially when joined with bearish candlestick indications. On this chart we 
also have a volume/candlestick signal of  a bottom.  On April 27,  there is 
a  doji  line.  For  reasons  discussed  in  Chapter  8,  doji  days  are  usually 
more significant as reversals in uptrends than in downtrends. Yet,  with 
verification, they also should be viewed as a bottom trend reversal. This 
unfolded in bonds. The importance of  the doji on April 27 became ampli- 
fied  when,  three days later,  another  doji  appeared.  Two  doji in  them- 
selves are  significant,  but look  at what else  occurred during  these  two 
doji  days.  First,  there  was  a  tweezers  bottom  (that is,  the  lows  were 
nearly the same). Note also the volume on these days. On April 27 vol- 
ume was 448,000.  Volume on May 2,  the second doji, was almost half  at 
234,000 contracts. A light volume test of  a support area is bullish. We  see 
the results. 

The bullish engulfing pattern,  shown in Exhibit 15.2, shows that late 
April  had  a  white  candlestick  with  the  largest  volume  in  the  last  few 
months. This forcibly proved the conviction of  the bulls. A light volume 
retest  of  these  lows  by  a  candlestick similar  to  a  hammer  confirmed a 
solid base. 

There are many specialized technical tools based on volume. Two of 

the more popular are on  balance volume and tick  volumeT".

ON BALANCE VOLUME 

On balance volume (OBV) is a net volume figure. When the market closes 
higher  compared  to  the  prior  close  the  volume  figure  for  that  day  is 
added  to  the  cumulative  on  balance  volume  figure.  When  the  close  is 
lower, the volume for that day is subtracted from the cumulative on bal- 
ance volume figure. 

OBV can be used in a few ways. One way is to confirm a trend. OBV 
should be moving in the direction of  the prevailing price trend. If  prices 
are ascending along with OBV, increased volume is reflected by the buy- 
ers,  even  at  higher  price levels.  This  would  be  bullish.  If,  conversely, 
price and OBV  are declining, it reflects stronger  volume from the sellers 
and lower prices should continue. 

OBV  is also used in lateral price ranges. If  OBV  escalates and  prices 
are  stable  (preferably at  a  low  price  area) it  would  exhibit a  period  of 
accumulation.  This  would  bode  well for  advancing  prices.  If  prices are 
moving  sideways  and  OBV  is  declining  it  reflects  distribution.  This 
would have bearish implications, especially at high  price levels.

EXHIBIT 15.3.  Silver-July 1990,  Daily (OBV with Candlesticks) 

OBV with Candlesticks 

As illustrated in Exhibit 15.3,  the June 13 heavy selloff of  silver was fol- 
lowed  by  a  small  real body.  This  harami  pattern  converted  the strong 
downtrend into a lateral trend. The market traded sideways for the next 
few  weeks.  During  that  time,  OBV  was  ascending  reflecting a  bullish 
accumulation. June 25 saw new  price lows. These lows did  not hold as 
evidenced  by  the  hammer  line  formed  on  that  session.  The  positive 
divergence in OBV,  the failure of  the bears to hold the new lows, and the 
hammer line supplied signs of  a near-term bottom. 

TICK VOLUME '" 

In the futures market, volume is reported a day late. As a way to circum- 
vent this problem, many technicians use tick volumeTM  to get a "feel" for 
volume on an intra-day basis. Tick volumeTM  shows the number of  trades 
per intra-day period. It does not show the number of  contracts per trade. 

246 

The Rule of  Multiple Technical Techniques 

It would indicate, for instance,  a tick volume of  50  trades per hour. We 
do not know how many contracts were in each  trade. They could  have 
been 50  single-lot orders or 50-100  lot orders. In this sense,  tick volume 
is  not a  true  volume figure. It is  useful,  though,  because it  is  the only 
means of  measuring the volume on a  more timely,  albeit less accurate, 
basis. 

Tick VolumeTM  with Candlesticks 

The hourly  intra-day chart in  Exhibit 15.4 shows  the usefulness  of  tick 
volumeTM.  After  a bullish hammer  late in  the session  on May  4,  prices 
moved  higher.  However,  these advancing  prices were  made on declin- 
ing tick volumeTM. This was one sign of  lack of  conviction by buyers. The 
other was the short white real bodies. In the first three hours of  May 8, 
there was a sharp price break. These made new lows for  the move. The 
intra-day action late on May 8 provided  clues this early morning  selloff 
was to be short lived. After the third hour's  long black line, a doji mate- 
rialized.  These  two  lines  formed  a  harami  cross.  Then  a  white  body 
appeared  a few  hours later which engulfed  the prior two black  bodies. 

EXHIBIT 15.4.  Cocoa-July 1990,  Intra-day (Tick VolumeTM  with Candlesticks) 

Candlesticks with Volume and  Open Interest

This was a bullish engulfing  pattern that  had  extra significance since it 
engulfed  two black bodies.  The lows made by  the white engulfing line 
also formed a tweezers bottom. 

Just in case, another hint of  a bottom was needed, tick volumeT"  sub- 
stantiated that the buyers were taking control. Prices rose after the afore- 
mentioned  bullish  engulfing  pattern.  During  this  rally,  volume 
expanded as did the height of  the real bodies. A shooting star and resis- 
tance near $1,340 from the prior week,  temporarily put a damper on the 
price ascent.  Once the market pushed above  the $1,340 resistance level 
via a window,  there was no doubt the bulls were in control. 

In Exhibit 15.5, the hammer hour on June 19 furnished a sign that the 
market may be searching for a bottom. The first hour of  June 20  made a 
new low at $16.62  (line 1). Tick  volumeTM  on  this  hour  was a brisk 324 
trades.  Another  move  down  to  that  level,  via  a  long  black  candlestick 
(line 2), was  made later that  session.  This time  tick  volumeT"  was only 
262 trades. The next session, June 21,  is the one of  the most interest. On 
the third hour of  trading, prices made a new low for the move at $16.57. 
This  new low  was  made on lighter tick  volumeT"  (249 trades) then the 
prior  two tests  (lines 1 and 2). This meant selling pressure  was easing. 
Prices  then  sprung back  and  made  an  hourly  hammer  line.  (From the

previous  discussion on  springs  in  Chapter 11,  you  know  to  look  for  a 
retest of  the recent high near $17.24.) 

OPEN INTEREST 

In the futures markets, a new contract is created when a new buyer and 
a new short seller agree to a trade.  Because of  this,  the number of  con- 
tracts traded in the futures market can be greater than the supply of  the 
commodity  which  underlies  that  futures  contract.  Open  interest  is  the 
total  number  of long or  short  contracts,  but  not  a  total of  both,  which 
remain outstanding. 

Open  interest  assists  in  gauging,  as  does  volume,  the  pressure 
behind a price move.  It  does  this by  measuring if  money is entering or 
exiting the market. Whether open interest rises or  falls is contingent on 
the amount of  new buyers or sellers entering the market as compared to 
old traders departing. 

In  this  section, our  focus  will be  on  the importance  of  price  trends 
accompanied  by  rising  open  interest.  The  major  principle  to  keep  in 
mind is that open interest helps confirm the current trend if  open inter- 
est  increases.  For  example,  if  the  market  is  trending  higher  and  open 
interest is  rising,  new  longs  are  more  aggressive than  the  new  shorts. 
Rising open interest  indicates that  both  new longs and  new  shorts  are 
entering the market, but the new longs are the more aggressive. This is 
because the new longs are continuing to buy in spite of  rising prices. 

A scenario such  as  building open interest and falling  prices  reflects 
the  determination  of  the  bears.  This  is  because  rising  open  interest 
means new longs and shorts entering the market, but the new short sell- 
ers are willing to sell at increasingly lower price levels. Thus, when open 
interest  rises  in  an  uptrend,  the  bulls  are  generally  in  charge  and  the 
rally should continue. When open interest increases in a bear trend, the 
bears are in control and the selling pressure should continue. 

On  the  opposite  side,  if  open  interest  declines  during  a  trending 
market it sends a signal the trend  may not continue.  Why? Because for 
open interest to decline traders with existing positions must be abandon- 
ing the market. In  theory,  once these old  positions are exited,  the driv- 
ing force  behind  the  move  will evaporate.  In  this  regard,  if  the  market 
rallies  while  open  interest  declines,  the  rally  is  due  to  short  covering 
(and old bulls liquidating). Once the old shorts have fled the market, the 
force behind  the buying  (that is,  short covering) should  mean  the mar- 
ket is vulnerable to further weakness. 

As an analogy, let's  say that there is a hose attached  to a main water 

Candlesticks with Volume and  Open Interest 

249 

line. The water line to the hose can be shut off  by a spigot. Rising open 
interest  is  like  fresh  water  pumped  from the  main  water  line  into  the 
hose. This water will continue to stream out of  the hose while the spigot 
remains open (comparable to rising open interest pushing prices higher 
or  lower). Declining open  interest is  like closing  the  spigot.  Water  will 
continue to flow out of  the hose (because there is still some water in it), 
but once that water trickles out,  there is no new source to maintain  the 
flow. The flow of  water (that is, the trend) should dry up. 

There are  other  factors to bear in mind  (such as seasonality),  which 

we have not touched upon in this brief  review of  open interest. 

Open Interest with Candlesticks 

Exhibit 15.1 on June bonds  showed  a  wealth  of  information  about  vol- 
ume. It also illustrates  the importance of  rising open interest to confirm 
a trend. Look again at this bond chart, but this time focus on open inter- 
est. Refer to Exhibit 15.1 for the following analysis. 

A minor  rally in  bonds started  March 13 and lasted  until March  22. 
Open interest declined  during this rally. The implication was that short 
covering caused  the  rally. When  the short covering stopped,  so would 
the rally. The rally stalled at line 1. This was a rickshaw man session that 
saw prices fail at the late February highs near 94. Open interest began to 
rise with the selloff that began on April 9. A rising open interest increase 
meant  that new longs and shorts  were entering the market. The bears, 
however,  were  the  more aggressive in their  desire  since they were still 
selling  at  progressively  lower  prices.  Open  interest  continued  higher 
throughout  the late  April decline. When  the  two  doji,  on April 27  and 
May 2, emerged at the 88  V2  level, open interest began to level off. This 
reflected a diminution of  the bears'  selling pressure. 

Ascending open interest and  prices throughout May  were a healthy 
combination  as  seen  in  Exhibit 15.6.  Not  so  healthy  was  the  fact  that 
June's rising prices were being mirrored by declining open interest. The 
implication is  that June's  rally was largely short covering. This scenario 
does not bode well for a continuation of  higher prices. The shooting star 
spelled a top for the market and the market erased in four sessions what 
it had made in about a month. 

If  there  is  unusually  high  open  interest  coinciding with  new  price 
highs it could presage trouble. This is because rising open interest means 
new short  and longs are entering the  market. If  prices are in a gradual 
uptrend,  stop losses  by  the  new  longs  will  be  entered  along  the  price 
move at increasingly higher  prices. If  prices suddenly fall,  a chain reac- 
tion  of  triggered  sell  stop  loss  orders  can  cause  a  cascade  of  prices.

251 

Exhibit 15.7 is a good case in point. Sugar traded in the $. 15 to $.I6 range 
for  two  months  from  early March.  Open interest  noticeably  picked  up 
from  the  last  rally  that  commenced  in  late  April.  It  reached  unusually 
high levels in early May. As this rally progressed,  sell stops by the new 
longs  were  placed  in  the  market  at  increasingly  higher  levels.  Then  a 
series of  doji days gave a hint of indecisiveness and a possible top. Once 
the market was pressed on May 4,  stop after stop was hit and the mar- 
ket plummeted. 

The second aspect of  this open interest level was that new longs who 
were not stopped out were trapped at higher price levels. This is because 
as open interest  builds,  new longs and  shorts are  entering the market. 
However, with the precipitous price decline, prices were at a two-month 
low. Every one who had bought in the prior two months now had a loss. 
The longs who bought anywhere near the price highs are in "pain." And 
judging from the high open interest figures at the highs near $.16, there 
were  probably  many  longs in "pain." Any  possible  rallies will be  used 
by them in order to exit the market. This is the scenario that unfolded in 
mid-May as a minor rally to $.I5 meet with heavy selling. 

CANDLESTICKS 
WITH ELLIOTT WAVE 

$a,iQ$ki~3+tf a ~ f t u  
"Like both wheels of  a cart" 

T h e  Elliott  Wave  Theory  of  market  analysis  is  employed  by  a  broad 
spectrum of  technical analysts. It is as applicable to intra-day charts as it 
is to yearly charts.  In this introductory section I only scratch the surface 
of  Elliott. Describing Elliott Wave methodology can be, and is,  a book in 
itself. 

ELLIOTT WAVE  BASICS 

The Wave  principle  was discovered by R.  N.  Elliott early in this century. 
He noted that, among other aspects, price movements consists of  a five- 
wave  upmove  followed  by  a  corrective  three-wave  downmove.  These 
eight  waves form a  complete cycle as illustrated  in Exhibit 16.1.  Waves 
1, 3, and 5 are called impulse waves while waves 2 and 4 are called correc- 
tive waves. Although Exhibit 16.1 reflects an Elliott Wave count in a rising 
market,  the  same  concepts  would  hold  in  a  falling  market.  Thus,  the 
impulse waves on a downtrending market would be sloping downward 
and  the  corrective  waves  would  be  upward  bounces  against  the  main 
trend. 

Another  major  contribution  of  Elliott  was  his  use  of  the  Fibonacci 
series  of  numbers  in  market  forecasting.  Wave  counts  and  Fibonacci 

254 

The Rule of  Multiple Technical Techniques 

EXHIBIT 16.1.  The Basic Elliott Wave Form 

ratios go hand in hand since these ratios can be used to project price tar- 
gets for the next wave. Thus, for example, wave 3 could be projected to 
move 1.618 times the height of  wave 1; a wave 4 could correct 38.2% or 
50% of  the wave 3 move; and so on. 

Elliott Wave  with Candlesticks 

This chapter illustrated  how candlesticks can lend verification  to  Elliott 
Wave termination points. The most important waves to trade are waves 
3 and 5.  Wave 3 usually has the most powerful move. The top of  wave 
5 calls for  a  reversal of  positions.  The  wave  counts  below are  with  the 
help  of  my  colleague,  John Gambino,  who  focuses  closely  on  Elliott. 
Elliott Wave counts are subjective (at least until the wave is over) and as 
such the wave counts below may not be the same as derived by  some- 
one else. 

A five-wave count  (see Exhibit  16.2a) is  discussed  wave  by wave in 
the following text. Impulse  wave 1 started  with the dark-cloud  cover in 
late  February.  Wave 1 ended at  the  harami  pattern  in  mid-March. This 
harami implied that the prior downward pressure was abating. A minor 
bounce  unfolded.  Corrective  wave  2  was  a  bounce  that  ended  with 
another  dark-cloud  cover.  Impulse  wave  3 is  the  major leg  down. The 
extent  of  this move can be estimated  by  using a Fibonacci ratio and the 
height of  wave 1. This  gives a  wave  3  target  of  $17.60.  At  $17.60,  look 
for a candlestick signal to confirm a bottom for  this wave 3 count. This 
occurred  on  April 11.  For  visual details  about  April 11,  refer to  Exhibit 
16.2(b) which is the intra-day chart of  crude. 

On April 11,  crude broke in the first hour as it falls $1 from the prior 
close. At  that  point,  the  selloff  looks  unending.  Then  some  interesting 
price events occur. The selloff abruptly stops at $17.35-very  close to the 
Elliott  count  of  $17.60.  Second,  the  hourly  chart  (see  Exhibit  16.2(b)) 
shows  that  the  first  hour  of  trading  on  this  selloff  ended  as  a  classic 
hammer. This potentially bullish indicator is immediately followed by a

series of  strong long white bodies. On this hourly chart the bullish ham- 
mer  and  the  ensuing  white  lines  confirmed  a  bottom  for  the  wave  3 
count.  The  daily  chart  also  provided  a  bottom  reversal  signal  with  a 
piercing  pattern  based  on  the  price action  of  April 10  and 11.  We  now 
look for a wave 4 rally. 

Corrective wave 4's  top should rally but should not  move above the 
bottom  of  the  prior  wave 1 according  to  Elliott  Wave  theory.  In  this 
example,  that  would  be  the  $19.95.  Approaching  that  level,  look  for  a 
bearish candlestick cue. That is, indeed, what unfolded. On May 14 and 
15,  the market stalled under $20  via  the harami cross and  tweezers  top. 
The wave 4 top was hit. 

Interestingly,  by breaking wave 4 into its (a), (b), and (c) subcompo- 
n e n t ~ ,  corroboration  by  candlestick  indicators  is  apparent.  At  (a),  a 
shooting  star  whose  highs  stopped  at  a  window  from  early  April 
appears. A morning star at (b) called the bottom. Subcomponent (c) was 
also the top of  wave 4 with its attendant bearish harami cross and twee- 
zers top. 

Exhibit 16.3  illustrates  that  the  five  impulse  waves  down  began  in 
late  December 1989 from 100.16. The wave counts are shown. The bot- 
tom  of  wave 1 formed  a  harami  pattern.  The  top  of  wave  2 formed  a

dark-cloud cover. Wave  3 did not give  a candlestick indication. Wave 4 
constituted a harami. The most interesting aspect of  this Elliott pattern is 
the fifth and final downwave. The fifth wave target is derived by taking 
the height of  the third wave and a Fibonacci ratio. This provides a target 
of  88.08. At the end of  April, the low of  the move was 88.07. At this low, 
the candlesticks sent a strong bullish signal based on a tweezers bottom 
and  two  doji  at  this  tweezers bottom.  Volume also  confirmed  this bot- 
tom. Please refer to Exhibit 15.1 to receive a more detailed description of 
what happened at this low vis-a-vis the candlesticks and volume.

WITH MARKET PROFILE@ 

?m%% 

"Existing together,  thriving together" 

Market  Profile@, used  by  many  futures  traders,  presents  information 
about  the  markets  that  was  previously  only  available  to  those  in  the 
trading  pits.  Market  Profile@ helps  technicians understand  the  internal 
structure of  the markets. It offers a logical, statistically based analysis of 
price, time,  and volume. This section examines only a few  of  the many 
tools  used  by  followers of  the Market  Profile@. Topics such  as different 
types of  profile days  (that is,  normal,  trend,  neutral,  long-term  market 
activity charts, and so on), or  the Liquidity Data Bank@ will  not be dis- 
cussed  here. The goal of  this brief  introduction is to alert the reader to a 
few of  the unique insights of  the Market Profile@ and how it can be used 
in conjunctionwith  candlesticks. 

A few of  the elements underlying the Market Profile@ are: 

1.  The purpose of  all markets is to facilitate trade. 
2.  The  markets  are  self  regulating.  The  regulating  constraints  include 

price,  time, and volume. 

3.  The markets,  as they attempt to facilitate trade,  will use price probes 
to "advertise" for sellers or buyers. The reaction to these probes pro- 
vides valuable clues about the strength or weakness of  the market. 

The Market Profile@ organizes daily action into half-hour periods and 
assigns a  letter  to  each  half-hour period.  Thus  the " A  period  is  from

8:00  to  8:30  A.M.  (Chicago time), "B"  is  from  8:30 to  9:00  A.M.,  and  so 
forth. For markets that open before 8:00 A.M.  (such as bonds, currencies, 
and  metals),  the  first  half  hours  are  usually  designated  "y"  and  "z." 
Each letter is called a TPO (Time-Price Opportunity). The half-hour seg- 
ment  represents  the  price  range  that  developed  over  that  time  period. 
This is displayed in Exhibit 17.1. 

The first  hour  of  trading  is  labeled  as  the  initial  balance.  This  is  the 
time period when the market is exploring the range of  trading. In other 
words, it is the market's  early attempt to find value. A range extension is 
any  new  high  or  low  made after  the first hour's  initial balance.  Exhibit 
17.1 establishes  a  selling  range  extension,  but  since  there  are  no  new 
highs after the initial balance, there is no buying range extension. 

Value, to those who follow Market ProfileB, is defined as the market's 
acceptance of  price over  time and  is  reflected in the amount of  volume 
traded  at  that  price.  Thus,  time  and  volume are  the key ingredients  in 
determining value.  If  the market  trades briefly at a  price,  the  market  is 
indicating  rejection  of  that  price.  That  is,  the  market  has  not  found 
"value." If  prices are accepted for a relatively extended  time with good 
volume,  it  connotes  market  acceptance.  In  such  a  scenario,  the  market 
found value. The market's acceptance of  price is where 70% of  the day's 
volume  occurred  (for  those  familiar  with  statistics,  it  is  one  standard 
deviation  which  has  been  rounded  up  to  70%). This  is  defined  as  the 
day's value area. Thus, if  70% of  the volume for trading wheat took place 
in a $3.30 to $3.33 range,  that range would be its value area.

A price  probe is the market's  search for the boundaries of  value.  How 
the trading and investing community acts on such price probes can send 
out  important  information  about  the  market  to  Market  Profile@ users. 
One of  two actions occur after a price probe. Prices can backtrack to the 
value area or  value  can  relocate to  the  new price. Acceptance of  a  new 
price  as  value  would  be  confirmed  by  increased  volume  and  the  time 
spent at that level. 

If  prices  backtrack  to  value,  the  market  shows  a  rejection  of  those 
prices that are considered unfairly high or low. Quick rejection of  a price 
can result in  what is called  an extreme.  An extreme is defined as two or 
more single TPOs at the top or  bottom of  the  profile (except for the last 
half  hour). Normally, an extreme at  the  top of  the  profile is caused  by 
competition  among  sellers  who  were  attracted  by  higher  prices  and  a 
lack  of  buyers.  A  bottom  extreme  is  caused  by  an  influx  of  buyers 
attracted  by  lower  prices  and  a  dearth  of  sellers.  Buying  and  selling 
extremes are noted in Exhibit 17.1. 

Q 

How the market trades compare to the prior value area also discloses 
valuable information. Market Profile
followers monitor whether there is 
initiating buying or selling, or responsive buying or selling. This is iden- 
tified by determining where the current day's  extreme and range exten- 
sions  are  occurring  with  respect  to  the  prior  day's  value  area. 
Specifically, buying below the  prior day's  value area is deemed  respon- 
sive buying because prices are below value and buyers are responding to 
what  they  perceive to be  undervalued  prices. These buyers expect that 
prices will return to value. 

Sellers at  prices below the  prior day's  value area are said  to be initi- 
ating sellers.  This means they are aggressive sellers since they are willing 
to sell at  prices under value. The implication of  this is that  they believe 
value  will  move  down.  Buying  above  the  prior  session's  value  area  is 
initiating  buying.  These aggressive buyers are  convinced  that  value  will 
move  up to  price.  Otherwise why buy above what is  now  perceived is 
as value? Sellers at prices above the prior day's  value area are responsive 
sellers.  They are  responsive  to higher  prices and expect prices to return 
to value. 

Trading should go in the direction of  the initiating group unless price 
is  quickly  rejected.  Thus,  if  there  is  initiating  selling activity  (extremes 
and/or range extension), under the previous day's value area on expand- 
ing volume, it should have bearish implications.

file@ say during this time period? July 2 had a relatively small value area 
as  compared  to  the  prior  session.  It  was  also  a  light  volume  session 
(132,000 contracts as compared to 303,000 the prior session). This hinted 
that  price  was  having  trouble  being accepted at  these  higher  rates.  In 
other words,  there was lack of  trade facilitation. It is also a profile with 
range extension to  both sides.  This indicates a  tug of  war  between the 
bulls and bears. 

July  3  was  another  light-volume  session  (109,000  contracts)  which 
significantly  discounts  the  bullish  developments-an  upside  range 
extension and a close  at  the  highs of  the day.  The  next  day,  July 5,  is 
where the weakness of  the market materializes. During the early part of 
the session, new highs were made for  the move. In the process, upside 
range  extensions  were  also  formed.  With  these  range  extensions,  the 
market was advertising  for  sellers. They got  them. The  market  sold off 
toward  the  latter  part  of  the session  (the J,  K,  and  L  periods) to  close 
near the low of  the day. The open of  July 6 saw initiating selling on the 
opening since the market opened under the prior day's  value area. This 
showed  immediate selling  activity. July 6  also  displayed  increased  vol- 
ume and an initiating selling extreme (that is, single prints at the top of 
the  profile) during  the  "y"  period.  This  confirmed  the  market  was  in 
trouble. 

In this example,  we see an important aspect about  the hanging man 
previously addressed; it is only what happens after that line that makes 
it a bearish indicator. July 3 was the hanging-man day. Here we see the 
Market Profile@ picture of  the hanging-man  line was giving some  posi- 
tive indications about the market. It was only on  the following session, 
July 5 and especially the morning of  July 6,  that a top was also verified 
via Market ProfileB. 

Exhibit 17.3 shows that July 5 was a very evident shooting star. After 
this  line  appeared,  cotton  plunged  for  three  sessions.  Was  there  any- 
thing prior to the shooting star a la Market Profile@ which gave signs of 
trouble? Yes,  there was.  From June 29  to July 3 prices advanced  but by 
way of  a shrinking value area. This meant less trade facilitation at higher 
prices.  The  market  was  having  trouble  accepting  these  new  highs  as 
value. In addition,  volume, as gauged by the total number of  those ses- 
sion's  TPO  counts,  was  decreasing  (actual volume  was  light  on  these 
sessions. However, since volume is not released until the following day, 
the TPO count can be used  as a gauge of  volume). Notice of  a top was 
provided by the shooting star of July 5. The Market Profile@ on that ses- 
sion  showed  a  range  toward  the  upside  failed  to  get  buying  follow- 
through.  Additionally,  the  entry  of  sellers  attracted  by  these  higher 
prices drove the market down as indicated by the range extension down 
and the weak close. These were bearish signs.

If  more proof  was needed, all one had to do was wait until the open- 
ing  of  July 6.  An  initiating  selling  extreme developed  on  the  opening 
under the previous day's  value area. This confirmed the presence of  sell- 
ers and difficulty  ahead. Thus,  the Market Profile@ tools confirmed the 
bearish implications of  the shooting star. 

There are some interesting  similarities between Market Profile@ con- 
cepts and candlesticks. Wider value areas in Market Profile@ usually rep- 
resent facilitation of  trade and, as such, increase the probability for price 
trend continuation. Thus, in an uptrend, one would like to see widening 
value areas. Likewise, with the candlesticks, one would like to see a rally 
via a series of  longer and longer white real bodies in order to confirm the 
power behind  the move. 

Shrinking  value  areas  in  Market  Profile@ reflect  less  facilitation  of 
trade and thus less certainty of  a continuation of  the price move. So it is 
with the candlestick's advance block or stalled patterns. In those forma- 
tions, the trend is still up but it takes place by means of  shrinking white 
real bodies. These formations indicate that the prior momentum is  run- 
ning out of  steam. 

What about a star in candlesticks? A short real body in an uptrend or 
downtrend would be a sign of  decreasing vigor by the bulls (a star in an 
uptrend) or  the bears  (a star  in a  downtrend). So  would  a  small  value 
area  after  a  strong  advance  (or  decline).  The  small  value  area  would 
reflect  a lack  of  trade facilitation. They could  be a  harbinger  of  a  trend 
change.  A hammer's  lower  shadow  might  be  formed  due  to  a  buying 
extreme in  which  lower  prices induce  an  influx of  buyers.  A shooting 
star's  long  upper  shadow  could  be  the  result  of  a  selling  extreme  in 
which higher prices attracted strong selling.

Options, at times, confer advantages over underlying positions. Specif- 
ically,  options offer: 

1.  Staying  power-buying  an  option  limits  risk  to  the  premium  paid. 
Options are thus useful when trying to pick tops and bottoms. These 
are risky propositions,  but  judicious use of  options can help mitigate 
some of  the inherent risks in such endeavors. 

2.  The  ability  to  benefit  in  sideways  markets-by  using  options,  one  can 
profit  if  the  underlying contract trades in  a  lateral range  (by selling 
straddles or combinations). 

3.  Strategy  flexibility-one  can  tailor  risklreward  parameters  to  one's 

price,  volatility, and timing projections. 

4.  Occasionally superior leverage-for  instance, if  the market swiftly rallies, 
under certain circumstances, an out-of-the money call  may provide a 
greater percentage return than would an outright position. 

268  The Rule of  Multiple Technical Techniques 

OPTIONS BASICS 

Before discussing how candlesticks can be used with options, we'll  want 
to spend  some  time on option basics. The five factors needed  to figure 
the theoretical value of  a futures options  price are  the exercise  price,  the 
time to expiration, the  price  of  the underlying instrument, volatility, and, to a 
minor extent,  short-term interest rates. Three of  these variables are known 
(time until expiration, exercise price,  and short-term interest rates). The 
two components that are not known (the forecasted price of  the under- 
lying instrument and its volatility) have to be estimated in order to fore- 
cast  an  option  price.  One  should  not  underrate  the  importance  that 
volatility plays in option  pricing. In fact,  at  times, a change in volatility 
can have a stronger impact on option  premiums than a change in price 
of  the underlying contract. 

Consider  as  an  illustration  an  at-the-money  $390  gold  call  with  60 
days until expiration. If  this option has a volatility level of  20%, its the- 
oretical  price  would  be  $1,300.  At  a  15%  volatility,  this  same  option 
would  be theoretically priced at $1,000.  Thus,  volatility must always be 
considered  since it can so forcefully affect the option premium. 

Volatility  levels  provide  the  expected  range  of  prices  over  the  next 
year (volatilities are on an annual basis). Without getting into the math- 
ematics,  a  volatility  of  20% on,  say,  gold  suggests  that  there  is  a  68% 
probability that a year from now gold's  price will remain within plus or 
minus 20% of  its current price. And there would be a 95% chance that a 
year hence golds's  price will remain within plus or  minus two times the 
volatility (that is,  two times 20% or 40%) of  its price now. For  example, 
if  gold is at $400 and  volatility is at 20%, there is a 68% chance that its 
price after one year will be between $320 and $480 (plus or minus 20% of 
$400) and a 95% probability that it will be between $240 and $560  (plus 
or  minus  40%  of  $400).  Keep  in  mind  that  these  levels  are  based  on 
probabilities and that at times these levels are exceeded. 

The greater the volatility the more expensive the option. This is due 
to  at  least  three  factors.  First,  from  the  speculators'  point  of  view,  the 
greater  the volatility,  the greater  the chance for  prices to move into the 
money (or further into the money). Second, from a hedger's perspective, 
higher price volatility equals more price risk. Thus,  there is more reason 
to  buy  options  as  a  hedging  vehicle.  And,  third,  option  sellers  also 
require  more  compensation  for  higher  perceived  risk.  All  these  factors 
will buoy option premiums. 

There are two kinds of  volatility: historic and implied. Historic volatil- 
ity is based on past volatility levels of  the underlying contract. It is usu- 
ally  calculated  by  using daily  price changes  over a  specified number of 
business  days on an annualized  basis.  In  the futures  markets,  20'or 30 

Candlesticks with Options  269 

days are  the  most  commonly used  calculations. Just because  a  futures 
contract  has  a  20-day  historic  volatility  of  15%  does  not  mean  it  will 
remain at that level during the life of  the option. Thus,  to trade options 
it is necessary to forecast volatility. One way to do this is by having the 
market  do it for  you. And  that is  what implied volatility does. It  is  the 
market's  estimate  of  what  volatility  of  the  underlying  futures  contract 
will be over the options's  life. This differs from historic volatility in that 
historic volatility is  derived from  prior  price changes  of  the  underlying 
contract. 

Implied  volatility  is  the  volatility  level  that  the  market  is  implying 
(hence its  name). Deriving this  number involves the  use of  a computer 
but  the  theory  behind  it  is  straightforward.  To  obtain  the  option's 
implied  volatility,  the  five  inputs  needed  are  the  current  price  of  the 
futures  contract,  the  option's  strike  price,  the  short-term  interest  rate, 
the option expiration date, and the current option price. If  we put these 
variables into the computer,  using an options pricing formula,  the com- 
puter will spit back the implied volatility. 

Thus,  we  have  two  volatilities-historic,  which  is  based  on  actual 
price  changes  in  the  futures,  and  implied,  which  is  the  market's  best 
guess of  what volatility will be from now until the option expires. Some 
option  traders  focus  on  historic  volatility,  others  on  implied  volatility, 
and still others compare historic to implied. 

OPTIONS  WITH  CANDLESTICKS 

If  a strong trending market has pushed volatility levels to unusually high 
levels, the emergence of  a candlestick reversal indicator may provide an 
attractive time to sell volatility or  to offset a long volatility trade.  In this 
regard,  the  most  effective  candlestick formations  may  be  those  which 
imply that  the  market  will  move into a state  of  truce between  the bulls 
and bears. These include the harami, counterattack lines, and other pat- 
terns discussed in Chapter 6. 

Selling volatili<could  be  done in the expectation that with  the can- 
dlestick's  signal, the market's  prior price trend will change. If  it changes 
to a lateral band, all other factors being equal (that is,  no seasonal vola- 
tility factors,  no expected economic reports,  and so on), volatility could 
decline. Even if  prices reverse, if  volatility levels were uncommonly high 
to  begin  with,  volatility  may  not  increase.  This is  because  the  push  in 
volatility may have occurred during the original strong trend. 

Candlestick reversal signals may also be useful in helping the techni- 
cian  decide  when  to  buy  volatility  (or  to  offset  a  short  volatility  trade 

270 

The Rule of  Multiple Technical Techniques 

such as a short strangle or straddle). Specifically, if  the market is trading 
in a lateral band and a candlestick reversal indicator appears, the market 
could  be  forecasting that a  new  trend  could  emerge.  If  volatility levels 
are relatively low at  the time of  this candlestick reversal,  the technician 
may not only see a new price trend,  but also a concomitant rise in vola- 
tility. This would be especially likely if there is a confluence of  technical 
indicators (candlesticks and/or Western techniques) that all give a rever- 
sal signal near the same price area. 

Candlesticks, as tools to predict shifts in volatility, should be viewed 
in the context that  these shifts  will  most likely be shorter  term. That is, 
if  one buys volatility keyed off  of  candlesticks and volatility does rise, it 
does not always  mean  that volatility will  remain  high  until  that option 
expires. 

Exhibit 18.1 shows that there were two top reversal warnings in mid- 
May.  The first was a  doji after a  long white  real  body.  Next,  were  the 
three black crows.  Historic volatility expanded  during the  selloff  which 
started  from these top reversal formations.  The end of  this selloff came 
with early June's  harami cross. Then the price trend changed from lower 
to  lateral.  Volatility  contracted  due  to  this  lateral  price  environment.

Thus,  for  those  who  were  riding  volatility  on  the  way  up,  the  harami 
cross could  have  been  viewed as a signal to expect  an end  to the  prior 
steep trend and,  consequently,  the possibility of  a decline in volatility. 
Based  on experience,  and for various other  reasons,  candlestick sig- 
nals seem to work better  with  historic volatility than with implied vola- 
tility. Nonetheless,  as shown in Exhibit 18.2, candlesticks, at times,  can 
be  useful  instruments  to  assist  in  forecasting  short-term  moves  in 
implied  volatility.  A  sharp  rally  developed  in  January.  During  this 
phase, implied volatility ascended along an uptrend. For much of  Febru- 
ary,  sugar  was  bounded  in  a  $.I4 to  $.I5 range.  In  this  period  of  rela- 
tively quiet trading,  volatility shrank. 

On February 26,  a  hammer  appeared  (area A in  Exhibit  18.2(b)). In 
addition,  this hammer session's  lower shadow broke under the support 
area from late January. This  new low  did  not  hold.  This demonstrated 
that the bears tried to take control of  the market,  but failed. Three trad- 
ing day's  later,  on March 2,  (area B in Exhibit 18.2(b)) the white candle- 
stick's  lower shadow  successfully  maintained  the lows  of  mid-January. 
In  addition,  the  March  2  low  joined  with  the  hammer  to  complete  a 
tweezers bottom. The combination of  all these bottom reversal indicators 
sent a powerful signal that a solid base had been built. A significant rally 
was thus possible. As shown in Exhibit 18.2(b), volatility at areas A and 
B  were at relatively low levels. With a possible strong price rally (based 
on  the confluence of  bottom  reversal signals discussed  above) and  low 
volatility, one could expect any price rallies to be mimicked with expand- 
ing volatility. That is what unfolded. 

Another  use for options and candlesticks is for the risky proposition 
of  bottom  and  top  picking.  Just about  any  book  on  trading  strategies 
warns against this. But let's  face it, we all occasionally attempt it. This is 
an example' of  how the limited  risk feature of  options may allow one to 
place a trade too risky for an outright future. Exhibit 18.3 is an example 
of  a trade I recommended. I would  not have made such a recommenda- 
tion without the limited risk feature of  options. 

Cocoa  was in a  major bull market  that started  in  November 1989  at 
$900.  This exhibit shows the last  three waves  of  an Elliott  Wave count. 
The top of wave 3 was accompanied by the shooting star and the bottom 
of wave 4 by  the bullish  piercing line. Based on a Fibonacci ratio,  there 
is a wave 5 target  near $1,520. Thus,  near $1,520  one should start look- 
ing  for candlestick confirmation  of  a  top.  And  in  late  May,  a  bearish 
engulfing  pattern  emerged  after the  market  touched  a  high  of  $1,541. 
This was close to the Elliott Wave count of $1,520  which signaled a pos- 
sible top. 

I could not resist such a powerful combination of  an Elliott fifth wave 
and a bearish engulfing pattern! Options  to the rescue! I recommended

a buy of  the $1,400  puts (because the major trend  was still up, I would 
have  been  more comfortable liquidating longs,  but  unfortunately I was 
not long during this rally). If I was wrong about a top and cocoa gapped 
higher  (as it  did  in  mid-May),  increased  volatility  could  help  mitigate 
adverse price action. As it turned out, this bearish engulfing pattern and 
Elliott fifth wave became an important peak. 

HEDGING WITH 
CANDLESTICKS 

$ . a f m m H  
"Take all  necessa y precautions" 

T h e  days  of  placing  a  hedge  and  then  forgetting  about  it  are  over. 
Hedgers are now more sophisticated and technically aware thanks to an 
increased  information stream.  Hedgers  are  consistently deciding  when 
and how  much of  their  cash exposure to hedge.  These decisions trans- 
late into  the  bottom line  of  profitability. In  this  chapter,  we'll  examine 
how candlestick  techniques  can  provide a  valuable  tool  to assist in  the 
decision-making process. This is because many candlestick indicators are 
trend reversal indicators and, as such, can provide valuable assistance in 
timing the placement or lifting of  a hedge,  and when to adjust a hedge. 
A hedger seeks to offset his current or anticipated cash price exposure 
by taking an opposite  position in the futures or options market. A short 
hedger  is  one  whose  underlying  cash  position  is  at  risk  of  declining 
prices.  A short  hedger,  for  example,  could  be  a  copper  producer  or  a 
farmer. To  help manage this risk of  lower prices, the hedger may initiate 
a short  position by  selling futures or  by  buying  puts.  If  prices fall,  the 
decreasing value of  their cash position will be at least partially counter- 
balanced by profits in the futures or options  position. 

An  ultimate  user  of  the  cash  commodity  can  become  a  long  hedger. 
Such a hedger is one whose underlying cash position is at risk of  rising 
prices. An example of  a long hedger is a shirt manufacturer who has to 
buy cotton to use in the production of  shirts. To  assist in managing this 
risk of  higher prices the manufacturer can place a long hedge by buying 

276 

The Rule of  Multiple Technical Techniques 

futures or calls. If  prices move up,  the higher  price needed  to purchase 
the cash commodity would be offset, at least partially, by the gains in the 
futures or options positions. 

In  many  instances,  the  underlying  cash  position  may  not  be  fully 
hedged  at  one  price.  The  hedger  may  intend  to  scale  into  the  hedge 
position.  Thus,  the question  a  hedger  must  frequently address is what 
percent  of  his exposure should  be  hedged.  Candlestick techniques  can 
help  answer  this  question.  By  exploring  the  following  examples,  it 
should  offer  insight into how candlesticks can be  used  to furnish clues 
as to when to adjust  the hedged portion of  the cash position. 

Candlestick  techniques  can  also  be  used  for  those  who  are  100% 
hedged. For  instance,  let's  say  that you are a corn farmer and  the corn 
market  is  trending against  your  cash  position  (corn prices  are  falling). 
This  should  mean,  as  a  short  hedger,  your  futures  hedge  position  is 
profitable.  If  a  strongly  bullish candlestick reversal formation  appears, 
and  you  believe  prices  will  rally,  you  might  want  to  ease  back  on  the 
hedge. In some instances, early lifting of  a profitable hedge may improve 
cash flow. However, no hedge should be viewed as a strategy to gener- 
ate profits. 

As  shown  in  Exhibit  19.1,  an  explosive  rally  unfolded  in  1988  as 

EXHIBIT 19.1.  Soybeans-Weekly (Candlesticks with Hedging)

prices nearly doubled  from $6 to $11.  In mid-1988, near  the peak of the 
rally,  the  candlesticks gave  a  reversal  signal a  la  the  bearish  engulfing 
pattern. This would have not been seen as a Western top reversal forma- 
tion  using  traditional  Western  techniques.  A  top  reversal  formation 
would have required a new high for the move and then a close under the 
prior week's close. The black candlestick session of  the engulfing pattern 
did  not create a new high. Thus,  while not a Western top reversal pat- 
tern,  it was a reversal formation with candlesticks. This bearish engulf- 
ing pattern, for a soybean farmer, could have been used as a warning to 
either  initiate short  hedge  positions or,  if  not  already  fully  hedged,  to 
raise the percentage hedged. 

In 1989,  another bearish engulfing pattern warned of  a top (this also 
was not seen as a  top reversal pattern using Western technicals). Short 
hedgers  could  have  placed  hedge  positions  here.  The  window  a  few 
weeks  later  was  another  bearish  candlestick  signal  which  would  have 
told  short  hedgers  to add  to  their  short  hedge  position  (if  not  already 
100% hedged). October's  bullish piercing pattern could  have been used 
as a signal to ease back on short-hedge  positions. For  those looking at a 
long hedge, the piercing pattern could be used as a signal to initiate such 
a hedge. 

As illustrated in Exhibit 19.2, a confluence of  bullish candlestick sig- 
nals emerged the last week in September and the first week in October 
in 1988. The most obvious was the bullish engulfing pattern. These two 
weeks also  created  a  tweezers  bottom.  Additionally,  the  white  candle- 
stick was a bullish belt hold which closed at its high. It also engulfed the 
prior five candlesticks. For long hedgers,  these would have been signs to 
start,  or add to,  their hedges. 

In early 1989,  the harami cross (an important  reversal signal), could 
have been used  by long hedgers to scale back on hedges. Also, the fact 
that this harami cross was formed by a long white candlestick and a doji 
would indicate that the market was in trouble. As discussed  in Chapter 
8,  a doji after a long white real body is often a sign of  a top. 

Exhibit 19.3 explores how a long crude oil hedger could use a candle- 
stick signal to get an early signal of  a bottom reversal and then use West- 
ern technical tools to confirm. a bottom and add to the long hedge. The 
first tentative bottom reversal clue came with a hammer on July 5 .  Since 
this  hammer  session  gapped  under  the  prior  lows,  it  should  have  not 
been  taken  as  a  bullish  sign  unless  it  was  confirmed  by  other  bullish 
indicators during  the  next  few  sessions.  The  next  clue  was  the bullish 
engulfing  pattern  which  provided  bullish confirmation to  the  hammer. 
This engulfing pattern  was also an extra important bottom  reversal sig- 
nal. This is because the white candlestick on July 9 engulfed not one but 
two  black  real  bodies.  At  this  point,  crude  oil  end  users  (that is,  long

hedgers) should  have seriously considered  placing hedges or adding to 
their hedge position. 

The  next clue came when  price lows at areas  A,  B,  and C were  not 
confirmed by lower momentum values. This revealed the fact  that  sell- 
ing  velocity  was  slowing  (that  is,  experiencing diminishing  downside 
momentum). 

The reasons above were more than enough to expect a price bounce, 
but there is another added feature. A traditional Western falling wedge 
pattern  was broken  to the  upside  about  the same  time the  momentum 
oscillator crossed into positive territory (see arrow). Based on the falling 
wedge,  there was a target to where the wedge started. This,  depending 
on how one views this wedge,  could  have been the June high near $19 
or  the May 18 high near $20.  On the piercing of  the rising wedge,  more 
long-hedge positions could have been added.

We  see  by  this  example  that  candlestick  techniques  can  provide  an 
earlier  warning  of  a  trend  reversal  than  with  Western  technical  tools. 
Also,  we see candlestick techniques, in conjunction with  Western  tech- 
nical methods, can create a powerful synergy. The more technical signals 
confirming each other, the greater the likelihood of  an accurate call for a 
trend change.

HOW I  HAVE USED 
CANDLESTICKS 

f#hiil&&hlgB~>tb L 
" A prudent  man has  more  than one  string  to his bow" 

T h e  following are some examples of  trades 1 recommended  to the Mer- 
rill  Lynch  system  over  a  month-long  period.  All  of  them  incorporated 
some candlestick techniques. Since I track futures,  the examples in  this 
chapter are futures oriented. Also, my bias is short term so the examples 
will  be  keyed  off  intra-day  and  daily  charts.  Each  person  has  their 
unique trading style. How you trade is different than how I trade. Thus, 
I would not expect you to go through all the same thought processes or 
actions that I did in these trades. 

My  goal in  this chapter  is  not  to  provide  you  with  a  set  of  trading 
rules. It is to show how one person has fused candlestick techniques into 
their trading methodology. I hope this chapter can start you on the road 
to incorporating candlesticks into your analysis. 

Exhibit 20.1 shows that the neckline of  a head and shoulders top was 
penetrated on May 29. The trend consequently turned down. In Western 
technical theory,  once a head and 'shoulders neckline is broken you can 
expect a bounce to that line before selling pressure resumes. During the 
week of  June 11,  prices were in the process of  approaching this neckline. 
June 11  was a strong  white session.  A short  sale at  that  point  was not 
attractive.  I  needed  proof  that  the  rally  was  running into  trouble.  The 
market gave a  hint  of  trouble by  way  of  the  next session's  small black 
real body.  It  signaled  that  the  prior  white  candlestick's strong  session 
may not continue. 

282

EXHIBIT 20.1.  Soybeans-November 1990,  Daily 

On June 13,  I recommended a short at $6.27. The stop was above the 
neckline at $6.35. The target was $5.90 (this was based on a support area 
earlier in  the  year). The  short  position looked  good  for  the  rest  of  the 
week  as  the  market  tumbled.  Then  on June 18,  the  market  shouted  it 
was time to cover shorts. The clues were: 

The  tall  white  candlestick on  June 18  engulfed  the  prior  black  real 
body. These two candlesticks formed a bullish engulfing line. 
The opening on June 18 made a new low for  the move by  punching 
under the early June lows. However, prices bounced right back above 
this early June low. This created a spring in which the lows were bro- 
ken and not held. Based on this spring,  I had targeted a retest of  the 
upper end of  the trading range at $6.30. 
The candlestick on the June 18 was a strong bullish belt-hold line. 
The new price lows were not validated by lower stochastic levels. This 
was  a  positive  divergence  and  it  demonstrated  that  the  bears  were 
losing control.

EXHIBIT 20.2.  Coffee-September 1990,  Daily 

The action on June 18 revealed that it was not an environment to be 
short. I covered my short the following session at $6.12. This is an exam- 
ple  of  placing a  trade  mainly based  on Western  technical analysis,  but 
one  which  also  used  some  candlestick  indicators  as  reasons  to  change 
my mind about the market's  trend. 

From  late  May  we  see a  series of  lower  highs as  delineated  by  the 
downward sloping resistance line in Exhibit 20.2. This shows the prevail- 
ing  trend  was down. There was support  going back  to late  March  and 
early May near $.92. When, on June 14,  coffee broke under these lows it 
was  time  to  look  for  an area  to  short. June 14's  long  black  candlestick 
showed the force behind the selling pressure. The market was too over- 
sold to short at this time. 

The  small  real  body  which  followed  the  long  black  line  created  a 
harami  pattern.  This  harami  pattern  told  me  not  to  rush  with  a  short 
since the prior downtrend had been neutralized.  A lateral trading band, 
or a rally, could unfold. It turned out coffee had a minor rally. The rally 
stopped  right  where it  was supposed  to  stop-near  $.92. What was so 
special about  $.92 as resistance? Remember the axiom  that  old  support 
can  become  resistance.  The  late  March  and  May  lows  were  near  $.92.

This level became resistance.  Once  the market  backed down from  near 
$.92 on the brief rally,  I knew  the bears  were still in  charge.  The move 
on June 20  opened a window.  This implied another leg lower. On June 

21, when the market failed to move above the window's  resistance area, 
I  recommended a short at $.go15 with a stop above the June 20  high of 
$.9175. The objective was for  $.8675 (this was based  on  support  earlier 
in the year). The market then backed off. 

At the time of  the chart shown in Exhibit 20.3, crude oil was in a bear 
market. So  I  was looking to short on rallies. A rally  started  on June 21 
with the hammer (note how I did not use this bullish hammer as a time 
to  buy.  Why? Because  the  major  trend  was  down). Then,  a  few  days 
after  the  hammer,  back-to-back bearish  engulfing  patterns emerged.  At 
that  time,  I suggested  a short sale.  There  was a  small window opened 
between June 15 and June 18.  In  the belief  that  this window would be 
resistance, I put a stop slightly above it at $17.65. The target was a retest 
near the hammer lows. A late rally on June 25 quickly backed off  from the 
resistance area made by the bearish engulfing pattern and the window. 
Exhibit 20.4 shows  that on June 4  a  hammer  and  a  successful  hold-

ing,  on a close,  of  the late April,  mid-May lows  of  $2.65.  It  was also a 
bullish spring since prices made new lows for  the move but  these new 
lows failed to hold. 

Although this was a bullish hammer I needed confirmation the next 
day before I could recommend to buy since the market was holding the 
$2.65  support  so  tenuously.  The  day  after  this  hammer  the  market 
proved itself  by  opening  higher.  I recommended  a buy  at $2.68 with  a 
stop under the support line shown at $2.64. The target was for a test of 
the downward sloping  resistance line at $2.79. The strong session after 
the hammer day made this into a morning star  pattern. 

Although  the  trade  in  Exhibit  20.5  was  not  profitable,  it  is  a  good 
example  of  how  candlesticks can  help  to  provide  good  trade  location. 
The price action on Friday, March 2 gave some buy signals. First, it was 
a hammer line. Next, this hammer's small real body was inside the prior 
tall real body creating a harami. This harami meant that the prior minor 
downtrend was over.  Finally,  the hammer  session's  lows took out sup- 
port  from  early  February,  yet these  new lows  could  not  hold.  In  other 
words,  the  bears  tried  to  break  the  market  and  they  could  not.  It  was 
time to step in and buy. 

 
286 

The Rule of  Multiple Technical Techniques 

On Monday,  March 5,  I suggested a buy at $21.38. The target  was a 
very short-term  objective for a  retest  of  the late  February  highs  of  $22. 
Since the target was so close, the stop was proportionally tight under the 
hammer's low at $21.10. On March 5 and 6, the market moved up to the 
February 28 and March 1 high's  near $21.75. It failed to move above this 
short-term resistance area. After seeing this failure, I moved the stop up 
to breakeven. I got stopped out in the pullback on March 7. Once prices 
pushed under the hammer's  lows prices fell in earnest. 

CONCLUSION 

w w z t - $ u B a a  

" Step after  step the ladder is ascended" 

T h i s  book,  the result  of  years of  study,  research, and practical experi- 
ence,  has  hopefully  opened  new  avenues  of  analysis.  After  spending 
some time with candlesticks, I am sure that you, like me,  will not trade 
without the insights they offer. 

I  do not  use  bar  charts  anymore,  I  only  use candlestick charts.  But 
that does  not mean  I only use candlestick indicators. While  the candle- 
sticks are a vital medium of  market analysis, I use all the technical tools 
at my  disposal.  This is  the advantage  of  candlestick charts.  With  them 
you can  use candlestick techniques,  Western techniques,  or  a combina- 
tion of  both. For experienced technicians you will find the union of  East- 
ern and Western techniques creates a wonderfully exciting synergy. 

Be  flexible  about  chart  reading.  Where  you  stand  in  relation  to  the 
overall  technical  evidence  may  be  more  important  than  an  individual 
candlestick pattern.  For example,  a bullish candlestick signal in a major 
bear  market  should  not  be  used  as  a  buy  signal.  A bullish candlestick 
formation, especially when confirmed by other technical signals in a bull 
market, would be a buying point. 

Even  though many of  you (I hope!) will be using  this book as a ref- 
erence, it does not mean each of  you will use its candlestick techniques 
in the same way. So I am not worried that if  others learn  these ancient 
investment techniques they will become invalid. This is because candle- 
sticks, as with all other charting methods,  require subjectivity: 

Two candlestick analysts are like two doctors who went to the same 
medical school. Each may have the same knowledge about how the body 

288 

Conclusion 

works,  yet  each  doctor,  because  of  his  experiences,  philosophies,  and 
preferences may give a particular patient a different diagnosis and  treat 
the  patient  differently--even  if  the  patient's  symptoms  are  the  same. 
The doctor brings his unique personality and perceptions to the diagno- 
sis. So it is with you and technical analysis. You are a  doctor of  the market. 
How you read and react to the symptoms of the market's  health through 
candlesticks techniques may not be the same as another candlestick prac- 
titioner.  How  you  trade  with candlesticks will  depend on your  trading 
philosophy, your risk adversity,  and your temperament.  There are very 
individual aspects. 

In addition, each market has its own unique personality.  As the Jap- 
anese express it, "The  pattern  of the market is like a  person's  face-no 
two are exactly alike." For example, dark-cloud covers seem to work well 
in  the  daily  crude  oil  charts,  while  hammers  appear  with  relative  fre- 
quency in weekly copper charts. By  studying your market's  personality, 
you can uncover the candlestick formations,  and variations of  these for- 
mations,  which appear  most and work best for that market. 

There is a saying, "Fish for me and I will eat for today, but teach me 
how to fish and  I will eat for  the rest of  my life." I  hope that this book 
has taught  you  how  to do a little fishing.  That what  you  discovered  in 
reading it can be used to unlock some of  the secrets of  the candlecharts. 
Based on centuries of  evolution,  candlestick charts are unmatched in 
their  capacity  to be  used  alone or  joined  with  any other  technical tool. 
This means that each of  you,  from the technical novice to the seasoned 
professional, can harness the power of  candlestick charts.

Advance  block-a  variation on three white soldiers in which the last  two 
soldiers (i.e., white real bodies) display weakening upside drive. This 
weakness could be in the form of  tall upper shadows or progressively 
smaller  real  bodies.  It  signifies a  diminution  of  buying  force  or  an 
increase in selling pressure.

Belt-hold line-there  are bullish and bearish belt holds. A bullish belt hold 
is a tall white candlestick that opens on its low. It is also called a white 
opening shaven  bottom.  At a low  price area, .this is a  bullish signal.  A 
bearish belt hold is a long black candlestick which opens on its high. 
Also referred to as a black opening shaven  head. At a high price level, it 
is considered bearish.

downside is needed to confirm this as a top. 

Eight  or  ten  new  records-after  about eight  to ten new price highs buying 
pressure should  end. After such an advance,  if  a bearish candlestick 
indicator  appears,  selling  is  warranted.  The  opposite  occurs  after 
eight or ten new lows. 

Engulfing  patterns-there  is  a  bullish  and  bearish  engulfing  pattern.  A 
bullish  engulfing  pattern  is  comprised  of  a  large  white  real  body 
which  engulfs  a  small  black  real  body  in  a  downtrend.  The  bullish 
engulfing  pattern is an important  bottom reversal.  A  bearish engulf- 
ing pattern  (a major  top reversal pattern), occurs when selling pres- 
sure  overwhelms  buying  pressure as  reflected  by  a  long  black  real 
body engulfing a small white real body in an uptrend.

Evening star-a  major top reversal pattern formed by  three candlesticks. 
The  first  is  a  tall  white  real  body,  the  second  is  a  small  real  body 
(white or black) which gaps higher to form a star, the third is a black 
candlestick which closes well into the first session's  white  real body. 

Evening doji star-the  same as an evening star except the middle candle- 
stick  (i.e.,  the  star  portion) is  a  doji  instead  of  a  small  real  body. 
Because there is  a doji in  this pattern, it is considered  more  bearish 
than the regular evening star. 

Falling three methods-see  "Three methods." 

Fry pan  bottoms-similar  to a Western rounding bottom. A window to the 

upside confirms this pattern.

Gapping play-there  are two kinds of  gapping play: 

1.  high-price gapping play-after  a sharp advance the market consolidates 
via  a  series  of  small  real  bodies  near  the  recent  highs. If  prices gap 
above this consolidation it is a buy signal.

2.  low-price gapping  play-after a sharp price decline the market consoli- 
dates via  a series of  small real bodies near  the recent lows. If  prices 
gap under this consolidation it is a sell signal.

Golden  cross-a  bullish  signal in  which  a  shorter-term  moving  average 

crosses above a longer-term moving average. 

Gravestone doji-a  doji in which the opening and closing are at the low of 
the session.  A reversal signal at  tops.  Also a  reversal signal at  bot- 
toms,  but  only  with  bullish  confirmation the  next  session.  See  the 
illustration under "Doji." 

Hammer-an  important bottoming candlestick line. The hammer and the 
hanging man are both the same line,  that is a small real body (white 
or  black)  at  the  top  of  the  session's  range  and  a  very  long  lower 
shadow with little or no upper shadow. When this line appears dur- 
ing a downtrend it becomes a bullish hammer. For a classic hammer, 
the lower shadow should be at least twice the height of  the real body. 

Hanging man-an  important top reversal. The hanging man and the ham- 
mer are both the same type of  candlestick line (i.e, a small real body 
(white or black), with little or no upper shadow, at the top of  the ses- 
sion's  range  and  a  very  long  lower  shadow).  But  when  this  line 
appears during an uptrend, it becomes a bearish hanging man. It sig- 
nals the market has become vulnerable, but there should  be bearish 
confirmation the next session (i.e., a black candlestick session with a 
lower  close  or  a  weaker  opening) to  signal a  top.  In  principle,  the 
hanging man's lower shadow should be two or three times the height 
of  the real body. 

Harami-a 

two  candlestick  pattern  in  which  a  small  real  body  holds 
within  the  prior  session's  unusually  large  real  body.  The  harami 
implies  the  immediately  preceding  trend  is  concluded  and  that  the 
bulls and bears are  now in a state of  truce.  The color of  the second

the opposite color of  the first real body. 

Harami cross-a  harami  with  a  doji  on  the  second  session  instead  of  a 
small real body. An important top (bottom) reversal signal especially 
after a  tall white  (black) candlestick line.  It  is also called  a  petrifying 
pattern.

High  wave-a  candlestick with a very long upper or lower shadow and a

High-price gapping play-see  "Gapping plays." 

In-neck  line-a  small white candlestick in a downtrend  whose close is a 
slightly  above  the  previous  black  candlestick's  low  of  the  session. 
After  this  white  candlestick's  low  is  broken,  the  downtrend  should 
continue.  Compare to on-neck line,  thrusting line, and piercing pat- 
tern. 

Inverted  hammer-following  a  downtrend,  this  is  a  candlestick line  that 
has a long  upper shadow and a small real body at  the lower end of 
the session. There should  be no,  or  very little,  lower shadow. It  has 
the same shape as the bearish shooting star, but when this line occurs 
in a downtrend,  it is a bullish bottom reversal signal with  confirma- 
tion the next session  (i.e., a white candlestick with a higher close or 
a higher opening).

sion are in the middle of  the session's  range, the line is called a rick- 
shaw  man. See illustration under "Doji."

Mat-hold  pattern-a  bullish continuation  pattern.  A  white  candlestick is 
followed  by  a  small black  real  body  which  gaps  higher.  Then  there 
are two small black candlesticks which are followed by a strong white 
candlestick (or a  candlestick which  gaps  open  above  the  last  black 
candlestick).

Morning star-a  major  bottom  reversal pattern  formed by  three candle-  Morning Star 

sticks. The first is a long  black  real body,  the  second  is  a small real 
body (white or black) which gaps lower to form a star,  the third is a 
white  candlestick  that  closes  well  into  the  first  session's  black  real 
body. 

Morning doji star-the same as a morning star except the middle candle- 
stick is a doji instead  of  a small real body. Because there is a doji in 
this  pattern  it  is  considered  more  bullish  than  the  regular  morning 
star.

Morning attack-the  Japanese expression for a large buy or  sell order on 

the opening that is designed  to significantly move the market. 

Night attack-the Japanese expression for a large order placed at the close

On-neck  line-a  black candlestick in a downtrend is followed by  a small 
white  candlestick whose  close  is  near  the  low  of  the  session  of  the 
black  candlestick.  It  is  a  bearish  continuation  pattern.  The  market 
should  continue  to  move  lower  after  the  white  candlestick's  low  is 
broken. Compare  to an in-neck line, a thrusting line,  and a piercing 
pattern. 

Petrifying pattern-another  name for the harami cross.

Rain  drop-see  "Star." 

Real body-the  thick part of  the candlestick line. It is defined by the clos- 
ing and opening prices of  the session. When the close is higher than 
the open, the real body is white (or empty). A black (or filled in) real 
body is when the close is lower than the opening. See the illustration 
under "Candlestick lines and charts."

Separating lines-when,  in an uptrend  (downtrend) the market opens at 
the same opening as the previous session's opposite color candlestick 
and then closes higher (lower). The  prior trend  should  resume after 
this line. 

Separating Lines 

Bullish 

Bearish 

Shadows-the  thin lines above and below the real body of  the candlestick 
line. They  represent  the  extremes of  the  day.  The  lower  shadow  is 
the  line  on  the  bottom  of  the  real  body.  The  bottom  of  the  lower 
shadow is the low  of  the  session. The  upper  shadow  is  the line  on 
top of  the real body. The top of  the upper shadow is the high of  the 
session. See the illustration under "Candlestick lines and charts." 

Shaven  bottom-a  candlestick with no lower shadow. 

Shaven  head-a  candlestick with no upper shadow. 

Shooting Star  Shooting star-a  candlestick with a long upper  shadow with little,  or  no

arises  after  an  uptrend.  It  is  a  bearish  candlestick  signal  in  an 
uptrend.

Side-by-side  white  lines-two  consecutive white  candlesticks which  have 
the same open and whose real bodies are about the same size. In an 
uptrend,  if  these side-by-side white lines  gap  higher,  it  is  a  bullish 
continuation pattern. In a downtrend,  these side-by-side white lines

long white real body or near its top. Sometimes there is a short white 
candlestick before the long white one. At the emergence of  the stalled 
pattern,  the market's  rally  should stall.  Also called  a deliberation  pat- 
tern.

Star-a  small real body (i.e., a spinning top) which gaps away from the 
previous long real body.  A star reflects a  diminution of  the force of 
the trend  preceding the star. Sometimes a star following a long black 
line in a downtrend is called a rain drop. 

Stars 

Tasuki gaps-there  are downside and  upside tasuki gaps. The downside 
tasuki gap is formed  when, in a declining market,  a black  real body 
gaps lower.  This  candlestick is  followed by  a  white  candlestick,  of 
about the same size, which opens in the black session's  real body and 
then  closes above  the  black's  real  body.  It  is a  bearish  continuation 
pattern. The upside tasuki gap is a bullish continuation pattern. It is 
formed when a white candlestick which gaps higher is followed by a 
black  candlestick  of  about  the  same  size  which  opens  within  the 
white real body and closes under the white's  real body.  Tasuki gaps 
are rare.

Three gaps-if  a bearish (bullish) candlestick indicator appears after three 
gaps higher (three gaps lower), buying force (selling pressure) should 
be exhausted. 

Three methods-there  are two types. The first is the falling three methods 
which is a bearish continuation pattern. It is comprised of  five lines. 
A long black real body is followed by three small, usually white, real 
bodies which hold within the first session's  range. Then a black can- 
dlestick  closes at a  new  low for  the  move. The  second  is  the  rising 
three  methods  which  is  a  bullish  continuation  pattern.  A tall  white 
candlestick preceded three small,  usually black,  real bodies that hold 
within the white candlestick's range. The fifth line of  this pattern is a 
strong white candlestick that closes at a new high for the move.

Three  white or  three advancing soldiers-this  is a group of  three white can- 
dlesticks  with  consecutively  higher  closes  (with  each  of  the  closes 
near the highs of  the session). These three white candlesticks presage 
more strength  if  they  appear  after a  period  of  stable  prices and at a 
low price area. 

Three White Soldiers 

Thrusting  line-a  white  candlestick which  closes  in  the  prior  black  real 
body,  but still under the middle of  the prior session's  real body. The 
thrusting line is stronger than an in-neck line, but not as strong as a 
piercing line. In a downtrend,  the thrusting line is viewed as bearish 
(unless two of  these patterns appear within a few days of  each other). 
As part of  a rising market it is considered  bullish. 

Thrusting Line 

Towers-there  is  a  tower  top  and  tower  bottom.  The  tower  top,  a  top

pattern which looks like it has towers on both sides of  the congestion

session or within a few sessions. They are minor reversal signals that 
take  on  extra  importance  if  the  two  candlesticks that  comprise  the 
tweezers  pattern also form another  candlestick indicator.  For  exam- 
ple, if  both session's  of  a harami cross have the same high it could be 
an important top reversal since there would be a tweezers top and a 
bearish harami cross made by the same two candlestick lines.

AMERICAN 
TECHNICAL TERMS 

This glossary clarifies the Western technical terms used in this book. 
It is not meant to be comprehensive or detailed because this book's focus 
is on Japanese candlesticks and not Western technical tools. 

Bar chart-a  graphic representation of  price activity. The high and low of 
the session define the top and bottom of  a vertical line. The close for 
the period is marked with a short horizontal bar attached to the right 
of  the vertical line. The open is  marked  with  a  short  horizontal  bar 
attached to the left of  the vertical line. Price is in on the vertical scale; 
time is on the horizontal scale. 

Blow-offs-a  top  or  bottom  reversal.  Blow-offs  occur  after  an  extended 
move.  Prices,  usually  with  very  high  volume,  sharply  and  quickly 
thrust strongly in the direction of  the preceding  trend. If  the market 
reverses after this action, it is a blow-off. 

Breakaway  gap-when  prices gap  away from  a  significant technical area 

(i.e., a trendline or a congestion zone). 

Breakout-overcoming a resistance or support level. 

Change of  polarity-when old support converts to new resistance or when 

old resistance converts to new support. 

Confirmation-when  more than one indicator substantiates  the action of 

another. 

Congestion zone or  band-a  period of  lateral price action within a relatively 

narrow price band. 

Consolidation-the  same as a  congestion  zone.  Consolidation,  however, 

has the implication that the prior trend should resume. 

304  Glossary B:  American Technical  Terms 

Continuation patterns-a  pattern whose implications are for a continuation 
of  the prior trend. A flag,  for instance,  is a continuation pattern. 

Crossover-when  the faster indicator crosses above (bullish crossover) or 
below (bearish crossover) the slower indicator. For example, if  a five- 
day  moving  average crosses  under a 13-day  moving  average  it  is  a 
bearish crossover. 

Divergence-when  related  technical  indicators  fail  to  confirm  a  price 
move. For instance, if  prices reach new highs and stochastics do not, 
this  is  a  negative divergence and  is  bearish.  If  prices establish  new 
lows and stochastics do not,  this is a positive divergence and is bull- 
ish. 

Downgap-when  prices gap lower. 

Downtrend-a  market  that  is  trending  lower  as  shown  by  a  series  of 

lower highs and/or lower lows. 

Double  bottom-price  action  that  resembles  the  letter  W  in  which  price 

declines twice stop at, or near,  the same lows. 

Double  top-price  action  that resembles a M in  which  price  rallies twice 

stop at,  or near,  the same highs. 

Elliott  Wave-a  system  of  analyzing  and  forecasting  price  movements 
based  on the works  of  R.  N.  Elliott. The  main  theory is  that  prices 
have five waves in the direction of  the main trend followed by three 
corrective waves. 

Exponential  moving  average-a  moving  average  that  is  exponentially 

weighted. 

Fibonacci-Italian  mathematician  who  formulated  a  series  of  numbers 
based  on  adding  the  prior  two  numbers.  Popular  Fibonacci  ratios 
used by technicians include (rounding off) 38%, 50%, and 62%. 

Flag  or  pennant-a  continuation  formation  comprised  of  a  sharp  price 
move followed  by  a brief  consolidation area. These are continuation 
patterns. 

Filling in  the gap-when  prices go into the price vacuum left by a gap. 

Gaps-a  price void  (i.e., no trading) from one price area to another. 

Historical  volatility-a  calculation  that  provides  an  expected  range  of 
prices over a specified time. It is based on price changes in the under- 
lying contract. 

Implied  volatility-the  market's  forecast of  future volatility levels. 

Inside  session-when  the  entire  session's  high-low  range  is  within  the 

prior session's  range. 

Glossary  B:  American Technical Terms 

305 

Intra-day-any  period  shorter  than  daily.  Thus,  a  60-minute  intra-day 
chart is based on the high, low, open and close on an hourly basis. 

Islands-a  formation  at  the  extremes of  the  market  when  prices gap  in 
the direction of  the prior trend. Prices then stay there for one or more 
days,  and  then  gaps in  the  opposite  direction.  Prices  are  thus sur- 
rounded by gaps which leaves them isolated like an island. 

Locals-traders  on  the  floor  in  the  futures  markets  who  trade  for  their 

own account. 

Market Profile@-a statistical distribution of  prices over specific time inter- 

vals (usually 30  minutes). 

Momentum-the  velocity  of a  price  move.  It  compares  the  most  recent 

close to the close a specific number of  period's  ago. 

Moving average convergence-divergence (MACD) oscillator-a  combination of 

three exponentially smoothed moving averages. 

Neckline-a  line connecting the lows of  the head in a head and shoulders 
formation or highs of  an inverse head and shoulders.  A move under 
the neckline of  a head and shoulders top is bearish; a move above the 
neckline of  an inverse head and shoulders neckline is bullish. 

Negative crossover-see  "Crossover." 

Negative divergence-see  "Divergence. " 

Offset-to  get  out  of  an  existing  position.  Longs  are  said  to  liquidate; 

shorts are said to cover. 

On-Balance  Volume  (0BV)-a 

cumulative  volume  figure.  If  prices  close 
higher than the previous session the volume for the higher close day 
is added to the OBV.  On a day, when the close is lower,  the volume 
for that day is subtracted from the OBV  figure.  Unchanged days are 
ignored. 

Open  interest-futures  contracts which are still outstanding. Open inter- 
est is equal to the total number of  long or short  positions,  but not a 
combination of  the two. 

Oscillator-a  momentum line that fluctuates around a zero value line (or 
between  0  and  100%). Oscillators  can  help  measure  overbought1 
oversold levels,  show  negative and  positive divergence,  and  can  be 
used to measure a price move's  velocity. 

Overbought-when  the  market  moves up too far,  too fast.  At  this point 

the market is vulnerable to a downward correction. 

Oversold-when  the  market  declines  too  quickly.  The  market  becomes 

susceptible to a bounce.

Positive crossover-see  "Crossover. " 

Positive d ivergence-see  "Divergence. " 

Protective  stop-a  means  of  limiting losses  if  the  market  moves  against

ically offset at the prevailing price. 

Rally-an  upward movement of  prices. 

Reaction-a  price movement opposite to the prevailing trend. 

Relative  Strength  Index-an  oscillator  developed  by  Welles  Wilder.  The 
RSI  compares  the ratio of  up closes to down closes over a specified

Resistance level-a  level where sellers are expected to enter. 

Retracement-a  price reaction from  the  prior  move in  percentage  terms. 

The more common retracement levels are 38%,  50%, and 62%. 

Reversal  session-a  session  when  a  new  high  (or  low)  is  made  for the 
move and the market then closes under (or above) the prior session's 
close. 

Reversal indicator-see "Trend reversals." 

Selling  climax-when  price  push  sharply  and suddenly  lower  on  heavy 
volume  after an  extended  decline.  If  the  market  reverses  from  this 
sharp selloff, it is viewed as a selling climax. 

Selloff-a  downward movement of  prices. 

Simple moving average-a  method of  smoothing price data in which prices 
are  added  together  and  then  averaged.  It  is  a  "moving" average 
because  the  average  moves.  As  new  price  data  is  added  the  oldest 
data is dropped. 

Spring-when  prices break under the support  of  a horizontal congestion 
band and then springs back above the "broken support" area. This is 
bullish. 

Stochastics-an oscillator that measures the relative position of  the closing 
price  as  compared  to  its  range  over  a  chosen  period.  It  is  usually 
comprised of  the faster moving  %K line and the slower moving  %D 
line. 

Support level-an  area where buyers are expected to enter. 

Tick  VolumeTM-the  number of  trades per given intra-day time period. 

Glossary  B:  American Technical Terms

Time filter-Prices have to stay above, or below, a certain price area for a 
specific  time  to  confirm  that  an  important  technical  area  has  been 
broken. For example, the market might have to close above a broken 
resistance level for  two days before a long position is placed. 

Trading  range-when  prices are locked  between  horizontal support and 

horizontal resistance levels. 

Trend-the  market's  prevalent price direction. 

Trend  reversals-also  called  reversal  indicators. This is a  misleading  term. 
More  appropriate,  and  more  accurate,  would  be  the  term  "trend 
change  indicator." It  means  the  prior  trend  should  change.  It  does 
not mean prices are going to reverse. 

Trendline-a  line  on  a  chart  that  connects  a  series  of  higher  highs  or 
lower lows. At least two points are needed  to draw a trendline. The 
more often it is tested,  and the greater  the volume on the tests,  the 
more important the trendline. 

Upgap-a  gap which pushes prices higher. 

Upthrust-when  prices break above a resistance line from a laterally trad- 
ing zone.  If  these  new highs fail to hold and prices  pull back  under 
the "broken" resistance line it is an upthrust. It is a bearish signal. 

Uptrend-a  market that is trending higher. 

V bottom or  top-when  prices suddenly reverse direction forming a price 
pattern that looks like the letter V  for  a bottom or  an inverted V for 
a top. 

Volume-the  total of  all contracts traded for a given period. 

Weighted  moving average-a  moving average in which each of  the previous 
prices is assigned a weighting factor. Usually, the most recent data is 
the more heavily weighted.
