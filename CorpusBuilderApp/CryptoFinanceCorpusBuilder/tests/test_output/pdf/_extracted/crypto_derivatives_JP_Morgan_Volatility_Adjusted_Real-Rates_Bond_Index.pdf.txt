J.P. Morgan Volatility Adjusted Real -Rates Bond Index  
Methodology and Factsheet  
Highlights   
The J.P. Morgan Volatility Adjusted Real -Rates Bond Index (VARRI) , part of the J.P. Morgan Macro Aware ™ family of 
indices , enhances the  well-established methodology and composition of the J.P. Morgan Government Bond Index (GBI ), with  
a design uplift to achieve a higher real-yield (inflation adjusted) . Unlike traditional bond indices that focus on market value 
weighting, the VARRI applies a Macro Aware ™ methodology to overweight sovereign exposure to higher real yields ( volatility 
adjusted ) and u nderweight those markets with lower real yields . The index utilizes macro signals (inflation expectations) from 
the J.P. Morgan Macrosynergy Quantamental System (JPMaQS)  and implied volatility estimates from J.P. Morgan Research.   
Index Criteria  
Instrument  Type : Global Government Bonds belonging to the  GBI Broad (ex US) benchmark.

FX Rates:  All FX rates used for unhedged returns are as of 4pm London time provided by WM/Reuters  
Weighting:  Baseline m arket capitalization based weighting  scheme of the GBI Broad Ex . US, subject to a

Historical revisions to the underlying Macro A ware™ input  data (post-index production ) will be 
considered in the next rebalance  and will not result in an index restatement  (post -revision) .   
 
Defining the universe of eligible countries   
The J.P. Morgan Volatility Adjusted Real -Rates Bond Index includes liquid, bullet, fixed - rate local debt issued from countries 
with floating currency regimes, as defined by the J.P. Morgan Government Bond (GBI) Broad Index  (ex. United States) .  
This index does not exclud e countries based on credit ratings and therefore can potentially span both investment grade and 
sub-investment grade government bond markets.  
 
Instrument type  
Only fixed -rate and zero coupon instruments are included.  Floating -rate and capitaliz ing/amortizing bonds,  or bonds with 
callable, puttable or convertible features are not part of the ind ex. 
 
Liquidity  
A key feature that distinguishes our indices from other index products is the strict enforcement of liquidity criteria in the  
selection of instruments. Yet, while the notion of liquidity differs from market to market, J.P. Morgan indices only include 
securities, subject to several considerations including but not limited to:  
 
• Pricing: Bonds must trade with enough frequency to prevent stale price quotations  
 
• Availability:  Bonds must be regularly traded in size at acceptable bid -offer spreads and readily redeemable for cash.  
A reasonable two -way market must exist for the instrument to be included in the index portfolio.  
 
• Replication costs:  Investors should be able to replic ate the index without incurring excessive transaction costs.  
 
Index Methodology  
The J.P. Morgan Volatility Adjusted Real -Rates Bond Index overweights (OW) the top three countries  with the highest “Real-
Rate Factor ” and underweights (UW) the bottom three  markets . The Real-Rate Factor is calculated by discounting  the 
nominal benchmark yields of each sovereign market  by the ir respective JPMaQS estimated 1 -year ahead inflation 
expectations1, and divid ing by each market’s local currency 3 -month At-The-Money ( ATM ) implied volatility  (IV).  
Mechanically, an overweight assignment corresponds to a +1.5%  allocation for the corresponding country in the benchmark, 
while an underweight carries a -1.0% allocation and a market -weight (MW) is held flat.  A floor of 0% is  also imposed for UW 
countries to avoid reflecting a short position. Once factor adjustments have been applied, we normalize to produce terminal 
country weights assignments.  
As additional  notes: countries withou t a 1-year inflation expectation figure, as provided by JPMaQS, were excluded from the 
index calculation ; Euro denominated countries all use the EUR /USD  3M ATM IV when computing the real -rate factor .  
JPMaQS Criteria  
The J.P. Morgan Volatility Adjusted Rea l-Rates Bond Index uses the J.P. Morgan Macrosynergy Quantamental System to 
inform the Macro A ware™ methodology used as an overlay to the flagship J.P. Morgan GBI -Broad ex. US Index.  
 
1 Estimated CPI inflation expectations of market participants for 12 months after the latest reported CPI data  (Macrosynergy method)  
 
 JPMaQS is a service which provides quantitative -fundamental (qua ntamental) data in line with the information available to 
market participants at the time of release, not an ex -post (revised) number.

Bond calculations  
Calculations are according to market convention : all calculations including accrued interest, duration, yield, etc., 
are done according to local market convention using parameters (ex -dividend rules, settlement conventions, etc.) 
relevant to each specific bond. All calculations are gross of tax and ignore transactions costs.  
 
Bond pricing : Pricing for our underlying instruments is provided on a daily basis from Pricing Direct, a third party 
valuation vendor. In the event the primary source for pricing is unable to provide a quote, the Index G roup reserves 
the right to consider the use of an appropriate alternative source for index inputs.  Please see http://www.pricing -
direct.com  for further details.  
 
Ex-dividend rules : ex-dividend rules, when applicable, are incorporated into accrued interest calculations, as 
appropriate, by country. Ex -dividend rules define the last day a bondholder must own a bond to receive that bond’s 
next coupon payment, otherwise known as the ex -dividend date.  
• During the period between the ex -dividend date and the coupon date, the bond trades “ex -dividend”  
• An investor who purchases a bond for settlement between the ex -dividend date and coupon date will not 
receive that bond’s next coupon payment.  
• During this period, according to market convention, accrued interest becomes negative resulting in a total 
price at a discount to the clean price and in effect, compensating the investor for the time the bond will be 
held without interest.  
• On coupon date, interest will start to accrue for the subsequent coupon payment.  
 
Returns and return indices:  return indices on individual bonds are calculated on a daily basis  and measure bond 
performance over time:  
• Principal return index is based on changes in clean price.  
• Interest return index is based  on changes in accrued interest.  
• Total return index is based on changes in both clean price and accrued interest.  
 
At the individual bond level focus is on total retur n. The segregation of interest and  principal return becomes 
relevant at the portfolio level.  
 
Reinvestment of coupons:  the J.P. Morgan indices are always fully invested. All  coupons received are immediately 
reinvested  back into the local market.  
 
 
 Interest accruals:  interest is accrued starting from the bond’s dated date up to the  first coupon value date. Accrued 
interest is calculated according to market  convention,  on a settlement  day basis.  Interest  is accrued  by value or 
settlement date.  Weekly, seven days of interest are accrued, including the weekend.  
 
In markets with ex -dividend rules, if a bond is purchased after the ex -dividend  date the purchaser will not receive the 
bond’s next coupon. In order to compensate  the buyer of the bond, the price paid for the bond must be less than the 
clean market  price, thus, accrued interest will be negative.  
 
Coupon value date:  The coupon value date is the trade date associated with  settlement on coupon date (the day the 
coupon is paid). Thus, the coupon value date is  the last trade date which an investor may purchase a bond and have 
that bond settle  prior to payment  of the subsequent coupon. On coupon value date, accrued interest  resets to zero, 
and accruals begin towards the next coupon.  
 
Yield:  effective annual rate of return, expressed as a percentage. For the  J.P. Morgan  Government  Bond Index body of data, 
yields are all calculated as yield - to-maturity,  which is the discount r ate that the present value of future payments  equals the 
price of the security.  
 
Index calculations  
The base for the index level is January 2, 2006  = 100. 
 
Daily  indicative pricing for each security and FX rate is closely scrutinized and are  reconciled using market 
movements and other pricing sources as guidance. As  necessary, an established alternate source will be used to 
maintain the integrity  of daily index calculations.  On any  given calculation day, if the primary source is  unable to 
provide a quote, the Index Group reserves the right to consider the use of  an appropriate alternate source for index 
inputs, such as pricing and FX. If a permanent  switch for the primary third party pricing source is necessary,  clients 
will be notified in advance prior to any official switch.
