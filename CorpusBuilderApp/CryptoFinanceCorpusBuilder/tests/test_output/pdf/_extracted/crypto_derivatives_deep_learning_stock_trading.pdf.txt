ABSTRACT
Stock trading strategies play a critical role in investment. However,
it is challenging to design a profitable strategy in a complex and dy-
namic stock market. In this paper, we propose an ensemble strategy
that employs deep reinforcement schemes to learn a stock trading
strategy by maximizing investment return. We train a deep rein-
forcement learning agent and obtain an ensemble trading strategy
using three actor-critic based algorithms: Proximal Policy Optimiza-
tion (PPO), Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), and Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG). The ensemble strategy inherits and inte-
grates the best features of the three algorithms, thereby robustly
adjusting to different market situations. In order to avoid the large
memory consumption in training networks with continuous action
space, we employ a load-on-demand technique for processing very
large data. We test our algorithms on the 30 Dow Jones stocks that
have adequate liquidity. The performance of the trading agent with
different reinforcement learning algorithms is evaluated and com-
pared with both the Dow Jones Industrial Average index and the
traditional min-variance portfolio allocation strategy. The proposed
deep ensemble strategy is shown to outperform the three individual
algorithms and two baselines in terms of the risk-adjusted return
measured by the Sharpe ratio.

1 INTRODUCTION
Profitable automated stock trading strategy is vital to investment
companies and hedge funds. It is applied to optimize capital allo-
cation and maximize investment performance, such as expected
return. Return maximization can be based on the estimates of po-
tential return and risk. However, it is challenging for analysts to
consider all relevant factors in a complex and dynamic stock market
[3, 23, 47].

Existing works are not satisfactory. A traditional approach that
employed two steps was described in [31]. First, the expected stock
return and the covariance matrix of stock prices are computed.
Then, the best portfolio allocation strategy can be obtained by
either maximizing the return for a given risk ratio or minimizing the
risk for a pre-specified return. This approach, however, is complex
and costly to implement since the portfolio managers may want
to revise the decisions at each time step, and take other factors
into account, such as transaction cost. Another approach for stock
trading is to model it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
dynamic programming to derive the optimal strategy [4, 5, 34, 35].
However, the scalability of this model is limited due to the large
state spaces when dealing with the stock market.

In recent years, machine learning and deep learning algorithms
have been widely applied to build prediction and classification mod-
els for the financial market. Fundamentals data (earnings report)
and alternative data (market news, academic graph data, credit
card transactions, and GPS traffic, etc.) are combined with machine
learning algorithms to extract new investment alphas or predict
a company’s future performance [10, 16, 45, 46]. Thus, a predic-
tive alpha signal is generated to perform stock selection. However,
these approaches are only focused on picking high performance

Trovato and Tobin, et al.

The critic-only learning approach, which is the most common,
solves a discrete action space problem using, for example, Deep
Q-learning (DQN) and its improvements, and trains an agent on a
single stock or asset [9, 12, 21]. The idea of the critic-only approach
is to use a Q-value function to learn the optimal action-selection
policy that maximizes the expected future reward given the cur-
rent state. Instead of calculating a state-action value table, DQN
minimizes the error between estimated Q-value and target Q-value
over a transition, and uses a neural network to perform function
approximation. The major limitation of the critic-only approach is
that it only works with discrete and finite state and action spaces,
which is not practical for a large portfolio of stocks, since the prices
are of course continuous.

The actor-only approach has been used in [13, 22, 33]. The idea
here is that the agent directly learns the optimal policy itself. Instead
of having a neural network to learn the Q-value, the neural network
learns the policy. The policy is a probability distribution that is
essentially a strategy for a given state, namely the likelihood to take
an allowed action. Recurrent reinforcement learning is introduced
to avoid the curse of dimensionality and improves trading efficiency
in [33]. The actor-only approach can handle the continuous action
space environments.

The actor-critic approach has been recently applied in finance [2,
26, 44, 48]. The idea is to simultaneously update the actor network
that represents the policy, and the critic network that represents the
value function. The critic estimates the value function, while the
actor updates the policy probability distribution guided by the critic
with policy gradients. Over time, the actor learns to take better
actions and the critic gets better at evaluating those actions. The
actor-critic approach has proven to be able to learn and adapt to
large and complex environments, and has been used to play popular
video games, such as Doom [43]. Thus, the actor-critic approach is
promising in trading with a large stock portfolio.

3 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
We model stock trading as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and
formulate our trading objective as a maximization of expected
return [20].

3.1 MDP Model for Stock Trading
To model the stochastic nature of the dynamic stock market, we
employ a Markov Decision Process (MDP) as follows:

• State 𝒔 = [𝒑, 𝒉, 𝑏]: a vector that includes stock prices 𝒑 ∈ R𝐷
+ ,
the stock shares 𝒉 ∈ Z𝐷
+ , and the remaining balance 𝑏 ∈ R+,
where 𝐷 denotes the number of stocks and Z+ denotes non-
negative integers.

• Action 𝒂: a vector of actions over 𝐷 stocks. The allowed
actions on each stock include selling, buying, or holding,
which result in decreasing, increasing, and no change of the
stock shares 𝒉, respectively.

• Reward 𝑟 (𝑠, 𝑎, 𝑠 ′): the direct reward of taking action 𝑎 at state

𝑠 and arriving at the new state 𝑠 ′.

• Policy 𝜋 (𝑠): the trading strategy at state 𝑠, which is the prob-

ability distribution of actions at state 𝑠.

• Q-value 𝑄𝜋 (𝑠, 𝑎): the expected reward of taking action 𝑎 at

state 𝑠 following policy 𝜋.

stocks rather than allocating trade positions or shares between the
selected stocks. In other words, the machine learning models are
not trained to model positions.

In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble strategy that com-
bines three deep reinforcement learning algorithms and finds the
optimal trading strategy in a complex and dynamic stock market.
The three actor-critic algorithms [24] are Proximal Policy Optimiza-
tion (PPO) [28, 37], Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) [32, 48], and Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) [28, 29, 44]. Our deep rein-
forcement learning approach is described in Figure 1. By applying
the ensemble strategy, we make the trading strategy more robust
and reliable. Our strategy can adjust to different market situations
and maximize return subject to risk constraint. First, we build an
environment and define action space, state space, and reward func-
tion. Second, we train the three algorithms that take actions in the
environment. Third, we ensemble the three agents together using
the Sharpe ratio that measures the risk-adjusted return. The effec-
tiveness of the ensemble strategy is verified by its higher Sharpe
ratio than both the min-variance portfolio allocation strategy and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1 (DJIA).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
introduces related works. Section 3 provides a description of our
stock trading problem. In Section 4, we set up our stock trading
environment. In Section 5, we drive and specify the three actor-critic
based algorithms and our ensemble strategy. Section 6 describes the
stock data preprocessing and our experimental setup, and presents
the performance evaluation of the proposed ensemble strategy. We
conclude this paper in Section 7.

2 RELATED WORKS
Recent applications of deep reinforcement learning in financial
markets consider discrete or continuous state and action spaces,
and employ one of these learning approaches: critic-only approach,
actor-only approach, or actor-critic approach [17]. Learning models
with continuous action space provide finer control capabilities than
those with discrete action space.

publicly owned companies based in the United States have traded during a standard
trading session in the stock market.

Figure 2: A starting portfolio value with three actions result
in three possible portfolios. Note that "hold" may lead to dif-
ferent portfolio values due to the changing stock prices.

The state transition of a stock trading process is shown in Figure
2. At each state, one of three possible actions is taken on stock
𝑑 (𝑑 = 1, ..., 𝐷) in the portfolio.

• Selling 𝒌 [𝑑] ∈ [1, 𝒉[𝑑]] shares results in 𝒉𝒕+1 [𝑑] = 𝒉𝒕 [𝑑] −

𝒌 [𝑑], where 𝒌 [𝑑] ∈ Z+ and 𝑑 = 1, ..., 𝐷.

• Holding, 𝒉𝒕+1 [𝑑] = 𝒉𝒕 [𝑑].
• Buying 𝒌 [𝑑] shares results in 𝒉𝒕+1 [𝑑] = 𝒉𝒕 [𝑑] + 𝒌 [𝑑].
At time 𝑡 an action is taken and the stock prices update at 𝑡+1,
accordingly the portfolio values may change from "portfolio value
0" to "portfolio value 1", "portfolio value 2", or "portfolio value 3",
respectively, as illustrated in Figure 2. Note that the portfolio value
is 𝒑𝑻 𝒉 + 𝑏.

• Risk-aversion for market crash: there are sudden events that
may cause stock market crash, such as wars, collapse of stock
market bubbles, sovereign debt default, and financial crisis.
To control the risk in a worst-case scenario like 2008 global
financial crisis, we employ the financial turbulence index
𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑡 that measures extreme asset price movements
[25]:

𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑡 = (𝒚𝒕 − 𝝁) 𝚺−1 (𝒚𝒕 − 𝝁) ′ ∈ R,

(3)
where 𝒚𝒕 ∈ R𝐷 denotes the stock returns for current pe-
riod t, 𝝁 ∈ R𝐷 denotes the average of historical returns,
and 𝚺 ∈ R𝐷×𝐷 denotes the covariance of historical returns.
When 𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑡 is higher than a threshold, which indi-
cates extreme market conditions, we simply halt buying and
the trading agent sells all shares. We resume trading once
the turbulence index returns under the threshold.

3.3 Return Maximization as Trading Goal
We define our reward function as the change of the portfolio value
when action 𝑎 is taken at state 𝑠 and arriving at new state 𝑠 ′. The
goal is to design a trading strategy that maximizes the change of
the portfolio value:

𝑇
𝑇
𝒕+1𝒉𝒕+1) − (𝑏𝑡 + 𝒑
𝑟 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 +1) = (𝑏𝑡 +1 + 𝒑
𝒕 𝒉𝒕 ) − 𝑐𝑡 ,

(4)
where the first and second terms denote the portfolio value at 𝑡 + 1
and 𝑡, respectively. To further decompose the return, we define the
transition of the shares 𝒉𝒕 is defined as

(5)
and the transition of the balance 𝑏𝑡 is defined in (1). Then (4) can
be rewritten as

𝒉𝑡 +1 = 𝒉𝑡 − 𝒌

𝑆
𝑡 + 𝒌

𝐵
𝑡 ,

3.2 Incorporating Stock Trading Constraints
The following assumption and constraints reflect concerns for prac-
tice: transaction costs, market liquidity, risk-aversion, etc.

• Market liquidity: the orders can be rapidly executed at the
close price. We assume that stock market will not be affected
by our reinforcement trading agent.

• Nonnegative balance 𝑏 ≥ 0: the allowed actions should not
result in a negative balance. Based on the action at time 𝑡,
the stocks are divided into sets for sell S, buying B, and
holding H , where S ∪ B ∪ H = {1, · · · , 𝐷 } and they are
nonoverlapping. Let 𝒑𝐵
𝑡 : 𝑖 ∈ B]
be the vectors of price and number of buying shares for the
stocks in the buying set. We can similarly define 𝒑𝑆
𝑡 and
𝑡 for the selling stocks, and 𝒑𝐻
𝒌𝑆
for the holding
stocks. Hence, the constraint for non-negative balance can
be expressed as

𝑡 : 𝑖 ∈ B] and 𝒌𝐵

𝑡 and 𝒌𝐻

• Transaction cost: transaction costs are incurred for each
trade. There are many types of transaction costs such as ex-
change fees, execution fees, and SEC fees. Different brokers
have different commission fees. Despite these variations in
fees, we assume our transaction costs to be 0.1% of the value
of each trade (either buy or sell) as in [45]:
𝑇
𝑐𝑡 = 𝒑

𝒌𝑡 × 0.1%.

𝑟 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 +1) = 𝑟𝐻 − 𝑟𝑆 + 𝑟𝐵 − 𝑐𝑡 ,

(9)
where 𝑟𝐻 , 𝑟𝑆 , and 𝑟𝐵 denote the change of the portfolio value comes
from holding, selling, and buying shares moving from time 𝑡 to 𝑡 + 1,
respectively. Equation (6) indicates that we need to maximize the
positive change of the portfolio value by buying and holding the
stocks whose price will increase at next time step and minimize the
negative change of the portfolio value by selling the stocks whose
price will decrease at next time step.

Turbulence index 𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑡 is incorporated with the reward
function to address our risk-aversion for market crash. When the
index in (3) goes above a threshold, Equation (8) becomes

𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑙 = (𝒑𝒕+1 − 𝒑𝒕 )𝑇
which indicates that we want to minimize the negative change of
the portfolio value by selling all held stocks, because all stock prices
will fall.

The model is initialized as follows. 𝑝0 is set to the stock prices
at time 0 and 𝑏0 is the amount of initial fund. The ℎ and 𝑄𝜋 (𝑠, 𝑎)
are 0, and 𝜋 (𝑠) is uniformly distributed among all actions for each

state. Then, 𝑄𝜋 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) is updated through interacting with the
stock market environment. The optimal strategy is given by the
Bellman Equation, such that the expected reward of taking action
𝑎𝑡 at state 𝑠𝑡 is the expectation of the summation of the direct
reward 𝑟 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 +1) and the future reward in the next state 𝑠𝑡 +1.
Let the future rewards be discounted by a factor of 0 < 𝛾 < 1 for
convergence purpose, then we have
𝑄𝜋 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) = E𝑠𝑡 +1 [𝑟 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 +1) + 𝛾E𝑎𝑡 +1∼𝜋 (𝑠𝑡 +1) [𝑄𝜋 (𝑠𝑡 +1, 𝑎𝑡 +1)]].
(11)
The goal is to design a trading strategy that maximizes the posi-
tive cumulative change of the portfolio value 𝑟 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 +1) in the
dynamic environment, and we employ the deep reinforcement
learning method to solve this problem.

4 STOCK MARKET ENVIRONMENT
Before training a deep reinforcement trading agent, we carefully
build the environment to simulate real world trading which allows
the agent to perform interaction and learning. In practical trading,
various information needs to be taken into account, for example the
historical stock prices, current holding shares, technical indicators,
etc. Our trading agent needs to obtain such information through
the environment, and take actions defined in the previous section.
We employ OpenAI gym to implement our environment and train
the agent [6, 14, 19].

4.1 Environment for Multiple Stocks
We use a continuous action space to model the trading of multiple
stocks. We assume that our portfolio has 30 stocks in total.

State Space. We use a 181-dimensional vector consists of
4.1.1
seven parts of information to represent the state space of multi-
ple stocks trading environment: [𝑏𝑡 , 𝒑𝑡 , 𝒉𝑡 , 𝑴𝑡 , 𝑹𝒕 , 𝑪𝒕 , 𝑿𝒕 ]. Each
component is defined as follows:

+ : adjusted close price of each stock.
+ : shares owned of each stock.

• 𝑏𝑡 ∈ R+: available balance at current time step 𝑡.
• 𝒑𝑡 ∈ R30
• 𝒉𝑡 ∈ Z30
• 𝑴𝑡 ∈ R30: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
is calculated using close price. MACD is one of the most
commonly used momentum indicator that identifies moving
averages [11].

• 𝑹𝑡 ∈ R30

+ : Relative Strength Index (RSI) is calculated using
close price. RSI quantifies the extent of recent price changes.
If price moves around the support line, it indicates the stock
is oversold, and we can perform the buy action. If price moves
around the resistance, it indicates the stock is overbought,
and we can perform the selling action. [11].

• 𝑪𝒕 ∈ R30

+ : Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is calculated
using high, low and close price. CCI compares current price
to average price over a time window to indicate a buying or
selling action [30].

• 𝑿𝒕 ∈ R30: Average Directional Index (ADX) is calculated
using high, low and close price. ADX identifies trend strength
by quantifying the amount of price movement [18].

4.1.2 Action Space. For a single stock, the action space is defined
as {−𝑘, ..., −1, 0, 1, ..., 𝑘 }, where 𝑘 and −𝑘 presents the number of
shares we can buy and sell, and 𝑘 ≤ ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥 while ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥 is a predefined

Figure 3: Overview of the load-on-demand technique.

parameter that sets as the maximum amount of shares for each
buying action. Therefore the size of the entire action space is (2𝑘 +
1)30. The action space is then normalized to [−1, 1], since the RL
algorithms A2C and PPO define the policy directly on a Gaussian
distribution, which needs to be normalized and symmetric [19].

4.2 Memory Management
The memory consumption for training could grow exponentially
with the number of stocks, data types, features of the state space,
number of layers and neurons in the neural networks, and batch
size. To tackle the problem of memory requirements, we employ a
load-on-demand technique for efficient use of memory. As shown
in Figure 3, the load-on-demand technique does not store all results
in memory, rather, it generates them on demand. The memory is
only used when the result is requested, hence the memory usage is
reduced.

5 TRADING AGENT BASED ON DEEP
REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

We use three actor-critic based algorithms to implement our trading
agent. The three algorithms are A2C, DDPG, and PPO, respectively.
An ensemble strategy is proposed to combine the three agents
together to build a robust trading strategy.

5.1 Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)
A2C [32] is a typical actor-critic algorithm and we use it a com-
ponent in the ensemble strategy. A2C is introduced to improve
the policy gradient updates. A2C utilizes an advantage function to
reduce the variance of the policy gradient. Instead of only estimates
the value function, the critic network estimates the advantage func-
tion. Thus, the evaluation of an action not only depends on how
good the action is, but also considers how much better it can be. So
that it reduces the high variance of the policy network and makes
the model more robust.

A2C uses copies of the same agent to update gradients with
different data samples. Each agent works independently to interact

Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automated Stock Trading:
An Ensemble Strategy

ICAIF ’20, October 15–16, 2020, New York, NY, USA

with the same environment. In each iteration, after all agents finish
calculating their gradients, A2C uses a coordinator to pass the
average gradients over all the agents to a global network. So that
the global network can update the actor and the critic network. The
presence of a global network increases the diversity of training data.
The synchronized gradient update is more cost-effective, faster and
works better with large batch sizes. A2C is a great model for stock
trading because of its stability.

The objective function for A2C is:

∇𝐽𝜃 (𝜃 ) = E[

𝑇
(cid:213)

𝑡 =1

∇𝜃 log 𝜋𝜃 (𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑡 )𝐴(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 )],

(12)

where 𝜋𝜃 (𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑡 ) is the policy network, 𝐴(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) is the Advantage
function can be written as:

𝐴(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) = 𝑄 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) − 𝑉 (𝑠𝑡 ),

or

𝐴(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) = 𝑟 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 +1) + 𝛾𝑉 (𝑠𝑡 +1) − 𝑉 (𝑠𝑡 ).

(13)

(14)

5.2 Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
DDPG [29] is used to encourage maximum investment return.
DDPG combines the frameworks of both Q-learning [40] and policy
gradient [41], and uses neural networks as function approximators.
In contrast with DQN that learns indirectly through Q-values ta-
bles and suffers the curse of dimensionality problem [8], DDPG
learns directly from the observations through policy gradient. It is
proposed to deterministically map states to actions to better fit the
continuous action space environment.

At each time step, the DDPG agent performs an action 𝑎𝑡 at 𝑠𝑡 , re-
ceives a reward 𝑟𝑡 and arrives at 𝑠𝑡 +1. The transitions (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 +1, 𝑟𝑡 )
are stored in the replay buffer 𝑅. A batch of 𝑁 transitions are drawn
from 𝑅 and the Q-value 𝑦𝑖 is updated as:
𝑦𝑖 = 𝑟𝑖 + 𝛾𝑄 ′(𝑠𝑖+1, 𝜇 ′(𝑠𝑖+1|𝜃 𝜇′, 𝜃𝑄′

)), 𝑖 = 1, · · · , 𝑁 .

(15)

The critic network is then updated by minimizing the loss function
𝐿(𝜃𝑄 ) which is the expected difference between outputs of the
target critic network 𝑄 ′ and the critic network 𝑄, i.e,

𝐿(𝜃𝑄 ) = E𝑠𝑡 ,𝑎𝑡 ,𝑟𝑡 ,𝑠𝑡 +1∼buffer [(𝑦𝑖 − 𝑄 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 |𝜃𝑄 ))2].
DDPG is effective at handling continuous action space, and so it is
appropriate for stock trading.

(16)

5.3 Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
We explore and use PPO as a component in the ensemble method.
PPO [37] is introduced to control the policy gradient update and en-
sure that the new policy will not be too different from the previous
one. PPO tries to simplify the objective of Trust Region Policy Op-
timization (TRPO) by introducing a clipping term to the objective
function [36, 37].

Let us assume the probability ratio between old and new policies

is expressed as:

𝑟𝑡 (𝜃 ) =

𝜋𝜃 (𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑡 )
𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑡 )

.

The clipped surrogate objective function of PPO is:

𝐽 CLIP (𝜃 ) = ˆE𝑡 [min(𝑟𝑡 (𝜃 ) ˆ𝐴(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ),

clip(𝑟𝑡 (𝜃 ), 1 − 𝜖, 1 + 𝜖) ˆ𝐴(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ))],

(17)

(18)

where 𝑟𝑡 (𝜃 ) ˆ𝐴(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) is the normal policy gradient objective, and
ˆ𝐴(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) is the estimated advantage function. The function 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝 (𝑟𝑡 (𝜃 ), 1−
𝜖, 1 + 𝜖) clips the ratio 𝑟𝑡 (𝜃 ) to be within [1 − 𝜖, 1 + 𝜖]. The objective
function of PPO takes the minimum of the clipped and normal
objective. PPO discourages large policy change move outside of
the clipped interval. Therefore, PPO improves the stability of the
policy networks training by restricting the policy update at each
training step. We select PPO for stock trading because it is stable,
fast, and simpler to implement and tune.

5.4 Ensemble Strategy
Our purpose is to create a highly robust trading strategy. So we use
an ensemble strategy to automatically select the best performing
agent among PPO, A2C, and DDPG to trade based on the Sharpe
ratio. The ensemble process is described as follows:

Step 1. We use a growing window of 𝑛 months to retrain our
three agents concurrently. In this paper we retrain our three agents
at every three months.

Step 2. We validate all three agents by using a 3-month valida-
tion rolling window after training window to pick the best perform-
ing agent with the highest Sharpe ratio [39]. The Sharpe ratio is
calculated as:

𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑝𝑒 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 =

,

(19)

¯𝑟𝑝 − 𝑟 𝑓
𝜎𝑝

where ¯𝑟𝑝 is the expected portfolio return, 𝑟 𝑓 is the risk free rate, and
𝜎𝑝 is the portfolio standard deviation. We also adjust risk-aversion
by using turbulence index in our validation stage.

Step 3. After the best agent is picked, we use it to predict and

trade for the next quarter.

The reason behind this choice is that each trading agent is sensi-
tive to different type of trends. One agent performs well in a bullish
trend but acts bad in a bearish trend. Another agent is more adjusted
to a volatile market. The higher an agent’s Sharpe ratio, the better
its returns have been relative to the amount of investment risk it
has taken. Therefore, we pick the trading agent that can maximize
the returns adjusted to the increasing risk.

6 PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
In this section, we present the performance evaluation of our pro-
posed scheme. We perform backtesting for the three individual
agents and our ensemble strategy. The result in Table 2 demon-
strates that our ensemble strategy achieves higher Sharpe ratio
than the three agents, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the tradi-
tional min-variance portfolio allocation strategy.

Our codes are available on Github 2.

6.1 Stock Data Preprocessing
We select the Dow Jones 30 constituent stocks (at 01/01/2016) as our
trading stock pool. Our backtestings use historical daily data from
01/01/2009 to 05/08/2020 for performance evaluation. The stock
data can be downloaded from the Compustat database through the
Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) [38]. Our dataset con-
sists of two periods: in-sample period and out-of-sample period.
In-sample period contains data for training and validation stages.

Figure 4: Stock data splitting.

Out-of-sample period contains data for trading stage. In the training
stage, we train three agents using PPO, A2C, and DDPG, respec-
tively. Then, a validation stage is then carried out for validating
the 3 agents by Sharpe ratio, and adjusting key parameters, such as
learning rate, number of episodes, etc. Finally, in the trading stage,
we evaluate the profitability of each of the algorithms.

The whole dataset is split as shown in Figure 4. Data from
01/01/2009 to 09/30/2015 is used for training, and the data from
10/01/2015 to 12/31/2015 is used for validation and tuning of parame-
ters. Finally, we test our agent’s performance on trading data, which
is the unseen out-of-sample data from 01/01/2016 to 05/08/2020.
To better exploit the trading data, we continue training our agent
while in the trading stage, since this will help the agent to better
adapt to the market dynamics.

6.2 Performance Comparisons
6.2.1 Agent Selection. From Table 1, we can see that PPO has the
best validation Sharpe ratio of 0.06 from 2015/10 to 2015/12, so
we use PPO to trade for the next quarter from 2016/01 to 2016/03.
DDPG has the best validation Sharpe ratio of 0.61 from 2016/01 to
2016/03, so we use DDPG to trade for the next quarter from 2016/04
to 2016/06. A2C has the best validation Sharpe ratio of -0.15 from
2020/01 to 2020/03, so we use A2C to trade for the next quarter from
2020/04 to 2020/05. Five metrics are used to evaluate our results:

• Cumulative return: is calculated by subtracting the portfo-
lio’s final value from its initial value, and then dividing by
the initial value.

• Annualized return: is the geometric average amount of money

earned by the agent each year over the time period.

• Annualized volatility: is the annualized standard deviation

of portfolio return.

• Sharpe ratio: is calculated by subtracting the annualized risk
free rate from the annualized return, and the dividing by the
annualized volatility.

• Max drawdown: is the maximum percentage loss during the

trading period.

Cumulative return reflects returns at the end of trading stage. An-
nualized return is the return of the portfolio at the end of each year.
Annualized volatility and max drawdown measure the robustness
of a model. The Sharpe ratio is a widely used metric that combines
the return and risk together.

6.2.2 Analysis of Agent Performance. From both Table 2 and Figure
5, we can observe that the A2C agent is more adaptive to risk. It
has the lowest annual volatility 10.4% and max drawdown −10.2%

among the three agents. So A2C is good at handling a bearish mar-
ket. PPO agent is good at following trend and acts well in generating
more returns, it has the highest annual return 15.0% and cumulative
return 83.0% among the three agents. So PPO is preferred when
facing a bullish market. DDPG performs similar but not as good as
PPO, it can be used as a complementary strategy to PPO in a bullish
market. All three agents’ performance outperform the two bench-
marks, Dow Jones Industrial Average and min-variance portfolio
allocation of DJIA, respectively.

6.2.3 Performance under Market Crash. In Figure 6, we can see
that our ensemble strategy and the three agents perform well in
the 2020 stock market crash event. When the turbulence index
reaches a threshold, it indicates an extreme market situation. Then
our agents will sell off all currently held shares and wait for the
market to return to normal to resume trading. By incorporating the
turbulence index, the agents are able to cut losses and successfully
survive the stock market crash in March 2020. We can tune the
turbulence index threshold lower for higher risk aversion.

6.2.4 Benchmark Comparison. Figure 5 demonstrates that our en-
semble strategy significantly outperforms the DJIA and the min-
variance portfolio allocation [45]. As can be seen from Table 2,
the ensemble strategy achieves a Sharpe ratio 1.30, which is much
higher than the Sharpe ratio of 0.47 for DJIA, and 0.45 for the
min-variance portfolio allocation. The annualized return of the en-
semble strategy is also much higher, the annual volatility is much
lower, indicating that the ensemble strategy beats both the DJIA
and min-variance portfolio allocation in balancing risk and return.
The ensemble strategy also outperforms A2C with a Sharpe ratio
of 1.12, PPO with a Sharpe ratio of 1.10, and DDPG with a Sharpe
ratio of 0.87, respectively. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that
the proposed ensemble strategy can effectively develop a trading

7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have explored the potential of using actor-critic
based algorithms which are Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO),

Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gra-
dient (DDPG) agents to learn stock trading strategy. In order to
adjust to different market situations, we use an ensemble strategy to
automatically select the best performing agent to trade based on the
Sharpe ratio. Results show that our ensemble strategy outperforms
the three individual algorithms, the Dow Jones Industrial Average

and min-variance portfolio allocation method in terms of Sharpe
ratio by balancing risk and return under transaction costs.

For future work, it will be interesting to explore more sophisti-
cated model [42], solve empirical challenges [15], deal with large-
scale data [7] such as S&P 500 constituent stocks. We can also
explore more features for the state space such as adding advanced
transaction cost and liquidity model [1], incorporating fundamental
analysis indicators [45], natural language processing analysis of
financial market news [27], and ESG features [10] to our observa-
tions. We are interested in directly using Sharpe ratio as the reward
function, but the agents need to observe a lot more historical data,
the state space will increase exponentially.
