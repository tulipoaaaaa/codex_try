INTRODUCTION
Fast forward to today and digital assets have grown to 
represent a significant market capitalization. Institutional 
adoption continues to grow rapidly with most either 
actively managing a portfolio of digital assets or planning 
to in the near term. Financial institutions can no longer 
ignore this asset class. However, while entering this 
complex and highly volatile asset class provides tremen-
dous opportunity, it is also fraught with new risks and 
challenges. The digital asset class is no longer just about 
Bitcoin. There are now many blockchains, cryptocurren-
cies and centralized exchanges (CEX) that make up the 
crypto economy. Add to that the advent of non-custodi-
al, decentralized exchanges (DEX) that leverage self-ex-
ecuting smart contracts to allow peer-to-peer (P2P) trad-
ing facilitated by automated market makers (AMM), and 
access to the emerging sector of decentralized finance 
(DeFi). DeFi is redefining how financial products and 
services are consumed and financial professionals like you 
are realizing the need to innovate in this environment to 
compete with crypto-native market entrants.
As digital assets become pervasive and widely adopted, 
the total market size and applications are unimaginable, 
but could represent trillions of dollars in new businesses 
being created as every individual and business around 
the world adopts this technology. Crypto native assets 
are just the beginning, as precious metals, real estate, 
equities, and more start to trade as digital assets, disrupt-
ing traditional ﬁnancial services. (Figure 2). For example, 
security tokens have been used to create digital assets 
that represent ownership in physical assets, such as 
gold, sports cars, and even assets like equity and debt. 
Additionally, decentralized exchanges and DeFi are rede-
fining how financial primitives are structured and traded, 
allowing new financial products to be built and deployed 
with instant global reach.
It has also led some to wonder: what data should we be 
looking at to enter the digital asset class? And how can 
we best analyze this data to gain insights on the indus-
try’s growth potential, investment risks, and possible 
investment opportunities? Successful crypto exchanges, 
asset managers, arbitrageurs, and providers are netting 
billions of dollars in profits, so it’s no wonder that many 
are looking for ways to tap into this emerging industry. In 
this guide, we’ll explore why you need digital asset data, 
the challenges with accessing it, and how to overcome 
them to gain an advantage in the crypto economy.
Less than a decade ago, virtually no financial professionals had 
heard of the term “blockchain”, with the technology confined to 
the domain of Bitcoin and its cypherpunks.

Digital Assets, Blockchain and DeFi are 
Redefining Finance
With former ETF traders taking advantage of crypto 
arbitrage opportunities to make billions of dollars and 
hedge funds aggressively increasing exposure to block-
chain technologies and cryptocurrency, it’s no wonder 
that every financial institution is looking to enter the 
digital asset class.
Financial professionals that ignore this massively  
growing industry today do so at their own peril.  
In addition to the return potential of this developing 
asset class, there is another reason that traditional 
financial institutions can’t afford to ignore blockchain 
and that is the rise of DeFi. DeFi is redefining the four 
core financial primitives (liquidity, leverage, risk, and 
arbitrage) that move financial markets for the crypto 
economy. DeFi applications being built on these rede-
fined primitives include:
•	 Decentralized exchanges (DEXs): Online ex-
changes that connect users directly on a block-
chain so they can trade cryptocurrencies without 
an intermediary.
•	 Lending platforms: Smart contract-based lending 
applications that replace intermediaries (e.g., 
banks).
•	 Prediction markets: Markets for betting on 
the outcome of future events, such as sporting 
events. 
Additionally, DeFi has spawned other new concepts 
not seen in traditional finance:
•	 Yield farming: Yield farming (or liquidity mining) 
refers to the practice of staking/lending crypto 
assets, bootstrapping economies that will gen-
erate interest, fees, and rewards in the form of 
additional tokens.
•	 “Wrapped” coins: A tokenized cryptocurrency 
that facilitates interoperability between different 
blockchain protocols. Wrapped coins allow users 
to earn interest on the coins they lend via decen-
tralized lending platforms.
•	 Stablecoins: A cryptocurrency that’s tied to an  
external asset (e.g., the dollar or euro) to stabilize 
the price.  
•	 Composability: Because DeFi apps are open 
source, they can be inspected and forked (a com-
pletely independent line of development based 
on the original open-source code) to innovate 
and create new applications. Token standards (like 
ERC-20), smart contracts and the open source 
ecosystem empowers rapid innovation.
•	 Money legos: As an analogy, think of DeFi apps 
as Legos, the toy bricks that snap together to 
construct buildings, vehicles, etc. DeFi apps are 
like “money legos” that can be snapped together 
to build new financial products.
Traditional financial applications are built on central-
ized, expensive, and proprietary infrastructure and 
software that must be maintained and managed. DeFi 
is recreating traditional financial systems for the cryp-
to economy and has the potential to replace them. 
However, financial institutions can innovate in this 
environment, taking advantage of the tremendous op-
portunities presented by digital assets, at massive cost 
savings over the traditional financial systems they’ve 
built and maintained.
The numbers speak for themselves: these are the early 
innings of what is already the next great technology 
disruption, and it’s important that financial institu-
tions understand how to get involved before it’s too 
late. Companies that fail to innovate litter the history 
books, while those that do achieve massive success. 
From Kodak to Blockbuster, companies that don’t in-
novate eventually become obsolete. The same can be 
said for financial services with respect to the digital as-
set and blockchain revolution: firms that don’t evolve 
will be replaced by those that do. 
Digital assets, blockchain and DeFi are already chang-
ing the way people save, invest, trade, own, and con-
duct business globally. This is not hype—this is reality.
58% multinational firms today are using crypto, while over  
80% of banks have invested in the technology.

Why You Need Digital Asset Data
And to answer those questions, they must have reli-
able data. Data fuels modern financial products and 
services, and in the digital asset class, it’s no different. 
Without comprehensive, granular and unopinionated 
digital asset data, financial professionals wouldn’t be 
able to make informed investment decisions, exchang-
es and wallets wouldn’t provide useful features, and 
developers wouldn’t be able to build the next genera-
tion of DeFi applications. 
Let’s dig into some of the use cases and questions that 
will need to be answered with digital asset data.
Pre-Trade
Generate alpha, develop research, mitigate risk,  
get operational context
Development and backtesting of cryptoasset  
algorithmic/programmatic trading strategies
Financial professionals employ algorithmic execution 
across all asset classes to generate returns when risk is 
a factor. In crypto, you can execute algorithmic trading 
on spot markets, derivatives exchanges, or decen-
tralized exchanges (DEX), so you’ll need data across 
them. With fundamental (on-chain) data and price 
movement market data, you can build a crypto alpha 
generation platform to develop quantitative financial 
models or trading strategies that generate consistent 
alpha, or absolute returns.
Identification of arbitrage opportunities
Whether discretionarily acting or using quantita-
tive data models executed through a bot (statistical 
arbitrage), once again, you’ll need comprehensive data 
across markets, centralized exchanges, and decen-
tralized exchanges (on-chain/blockchain fundamental 
data) to identify opportunity and manage risks like 
price impact, slippage, price movement and transfer 
fees. There are many opportunities for arbitrageurs to 
explore:
•	 On or across spot markets
•	 On or across derivative/futures exchanges
•	 Between spot markets and derivative exchanges
•	 Triangular arbitrage on a single exchange
•	 Defi arbitrage across multiple decentralized ex-
changes as well as the liquidity pools below those 
decentralized exchanges
Development and backtesting of liquidity provider/
market maker models
In cryptocurrency, market making involves providing 
liquidity on a specific cryptocurrency by submitting 
both bid and ask limit orders on centralized exchanges. 
Market makers make a profit by collecting the bid-ask 
spread over multiple trades, as well as rewards. Market 
making can be done on an exchange or across multiple 
exchanges. Comprehensive data will be required to 
develop and train quantitative data models to:
•	 Understand volatility and liquidity on exchanges 
to adjust bid-ask spreads
•	 Determine correlations between implied volatility 
and spread width
•	 Determine when to pull bid/ask and pay penalties 
to avoid steep losses
•	 Get a view of your liquidity across exchanges in 
real-time (operational content and relationships)
Decentralized exchanges supply additional oppor-
tunities for market makers to provide liquidity. By 
participating in DEXs, liquidity providers can earn fees, 
rewards and other incentives. Context across DEXs, 
Pools and CEXs is critical to maintain a comprehensive 
vantage point. To operate effectively and efficiently, a 
liquidity provider must know:
•	 LP positions
•	 % of pool
•	 Fees earned and fees earned and unclaimed
•	 Protocol incentives
•	 Impermanent loss
There are many questions that financial professionals will need to 
answer related to research, trading, risk, custody, analytics,  
reporting, and compliance to enter and succeed in the digital
asset class.

Development of original research on digital assets
Research analysts require data to study cryptocurren-
cies to generate investment ideas and recommenda-
tions to traders as well as general digital asset strate-
gies. They’ll need to:
•	 Understand what digital assets are moving, de-
termine how to rank them, and find trends in the 
data.
•	 Understand operational context and have a global 
perspective on markets.
•	 Understand both centralized and decentralized 
exchanges. How many participants are there in an 
exchange? What is the transaction volume? Who 
is providing the liquidity? Who held what, at what 
price, and for how long? Where did they send it? 
For wallets that hold a particular asset, what else 
did they hold? When they sold an asset, what did 
they buy? When a smart contract was deployed, 
who interacted with it?
•	 Identify the participants in a cryptocurrency eco-
system. Determine how much money is backing 
it, and what the flows into it and out of it are. 
Determine if it is risk-on or risk-off in the market. 
Analyze flow into and out of assets. Determine if 
people are trading one crypto for another or for a 
stable coin?
•	 Build risk models and identify opportunity.
•	 Analyze cryptoeconomic mechanisms.
•	 Understand the NFT market, and in the future, 
when almost every physical asset will be toke-
nized, identify risk and opportunity in those digital 
assets.
Post-Trade
Manage risk and ensure compliance
Risk Management
Digital assets present opportunities for high returns, 
but they are also subject to extreme volatility. In order 
to monitor your firm’s digital asset trading and identify 
and manage risk, you’ll once again need data. As you 
enter the digital asset class and your quants devel-
op algorithmic trading, arbitrage, lending and market 
making bots trying to generate returns, you’ll need 
to understand total exposure to volatility and other 
factors. While risk management professionals are used 
to these challenges, the complexity of digital assets 
exacerbates them. With thousands of cryptocurrencies 
and hundreds of exchanges, the amount of data you’ll 
be dealing with to manage risk surpasses any other 
asset class by a wide margin. You’ll also need to deal 
with unique risks in this asset class:
•	 Valuation – Traditional methodologies to quantify 
and determine exposure don’t apply to cryptocur-
rencies. Whether you are using absolute models 
such as cash flows, staking, rewards, revenue 
earned, yields on cash flow, or relative valuation 
models like Stock to Flow and hash rates to pro-
duction, you need comprehensive data you can 
trust.
•	 Modeling – modeling future cryptocurrency expo-
sures and risk is complex and will require market 
pricing data from centralized exchanges as well as 
blockchain transaction data to gain insight into 
the mechanisms managing scarcity, the number 
of unique participants or the Total Value Locked 
(TVL) in a protocol.
•	 Trading costs and liquidity – Price discovery is 
challenging because of the high volatility and lim-
ited liquidity in the crypto market. Trading costs 
are high and can vary widely based on time of day 
and exchange.
•	 Settlement – Accounting and settlement of a 
trade has a significant impact on quantifying 
exposure valuation and adds complexity and risk. 
Since methodology can be substantially differ-
ent across exchanges, it is complex to estimate 
risk exposure and counterparty credit risks are 
increased.
•	 Derivatives – Crypto futures and options trading, 
as in traditional markets, represents significant 
volume. Due to the leverage offered by exchanges, 
many of them have dynamic liquidation policies 
to manage risk. These liquidations in derivatives 
markets can propagate across exchanges and into 
the spot market.

PAGE 6  |  THE DIGITAL ASSET DATA GUIDE FOR FINANCIAL PROFESSIONALS
Compliance
Of course, maintaining tax and regulatory compliance 
will require data, and once again, digital assets are 
more complex than traditional assets because they 
are living software and may trade across many trading 
venues. 
It’s clear that as institutions become more active in 
digital assets, regulation and mitigating exposure to 
enforcement actions, ensuring compliance and sup-
porting audit requirements will be mandatory. In order 
to stay compliant and able to respond to regulators 
and auditors, you’ll need to access data stored on 
multiple blockchains, centralized and decentralized 
exchanges, and wallets. 
The complex nature of cryptocurrency transactions, 
and the fact that some network and digital assets 
protocol data is ephemeral, complicates accounting 
and tax compliance. A transaction can include a token 
transfer, staking tokens to a liquidity pool in a DEX 
(swapping for LP tokens), obtaining fees and receiving 
rewards. On every single one of these sub-transac-
tions, there’s the potential to make or lose money.
The decentralized and pseudonymous nature of much 
of the crypto economy make KYC/AML compliance 
difficult. However, for regulated financial institutions 
to enter the asset class and adopt DeFi, they’ll need 
to ensure and prove compliance. As an example, 
many financial institutions are building “blacklists” 
of non-compliant wallets. Prior to participating in a 
particular liquidity pool as a market maker, compre-
hensive and granular on-chain data can be used to 
determine the address of every wallet participating 
so it’s ensured that no “blacklisted wallets” are also 
participating. Having historical on-chain transactions 
for “blacklisted” addresses can allow you to track their 
counterparties.

Because of
The Complexities of Building Digital Asset 
Data Infrastructure
Digital assets trade in spot markets, derivatives markets, 
and on decentralized trading venues across the world 
and around the clock. Institutions need to connect to 
all these venues, stay up to date with fast-moving APIs, 
and normalize the data. And, in addition to all the trading 
venues, digital assets are built on global decentralized 
networks and protocols, presenting considerable opera-
tional challenges.
The number of blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and cen-
tralized exchanges already in existence means that data 
needs to be collected from hundreds, if not thousands, 
of sources. Given the sector’s rapid growth, new data 
sources will need to be added frequently. Decentralized 
exchanges and DeFi increase the challenge considerably 
by necessitating a deeper understanding of on-chain 
data and more comprehensive data collection. Further, 
the advent of Layer 2 means there will be webs of block-
chains and cross-chain assets in the future, requiring 
interoperability that will be even more complex to build 
and operate.
Digital Asset Data Infrastructure Requirements
In order to get a comprehensive understanding of digital 
assets, you need both market data and on-chain (block-
chain) fundamental data for all the venues you plan to 
operate on. Each centralized exchange has its own mar-
ket data APIs. Getting data from each exchange requires 
building and maintaining a dedicated infrastructure to 
collect, ingest, store and serve the data in a highly avail-
able and scalable service institutions can depend on.
In addition to comprehensive market data from central-
ized exchanges, institutions also need on-chain data to 
build the complete picture even if they have market data 
from every centralized digital asset exchange in existence.
On-chain data is the key to gaining visibility into DEX 
transactions and DeFi activities. Without this data, de-
veloping DeFi strategies, managing risk, and maintaining 
regulatory compliance is impossible. Accessing on-chain 
Due to the highly decentralized, globalized, and round-the-clock 
nature of the digital asset ecosystem, the data is substantially 
more complex than in traditional finance, and collecting it is
more challenging.
Figure 3. Financial institutions need reliable data infrastructure in order to offer digital assets, products and services.

PAGE 8  |  THE DIGITAL ASSET DATA GUIDE FOR FINANCIAL PROFESSIONALS
data requires building and maintaining highly available 
nodes for each blockchain you need data for. Each block-
chain has its own specific requirements, including the 
technology used, procedures, protocols and data. Each 
one also has its own security risks. Your team will need 
an expert for each blockchain you wish to work with to 
support its node(s).
Further, raw blockchain data is not indexed, searchable, 
or normalized to time series. A block is merely a point 
in time state of what’s happening. Each block can have 
between a few hundred to a million transactions, but 
there’s no context as to what happened in the previous 
block. Even simple questions like “what was the balance 
of my Etherum wallet for the year,” require multiple steps 
accessing a significant amount of data to answer.
Performing the needed analysis may require calling hun-
dreds of thousands, if not millions, of blocks to extract 
details like balance, logs, and events. Additionally, it re-
quires getting pricing data from a third-party source and 
reconstitution of the transaction in an external database. 
Analyzing compound transactions that occur across 
multiple blockchains, exchanges, and tokens is even more 
challenging. 
As a result, before on-chain data can be used, it needs 
to be processed to create datasets in a format your data 
teams are familiar with by someone with deep exper-
tise in the blockchain being accessed. To be usable for 
making investment decisions, these data sets need to be 
comprehensive, granular, unopinionated, and unfiltered. 
For institutional activities, it is also necessary to extract 
multiple types of information from the raw blockchain 
data to have the right context for each activity.
Adding to the challenge is the fact that certain trans-
actional data, like mempool data, is ephemeral, which 
makes it impossible to replay exactly what happened on-
chain unless the data is captured in flight. To capture this 
data, financial institutions need to actively and reliably 
track blockchain activity 24/7.
Why Institutions Shouldn’t Build 
Their Own Infrastructure
The open-source nature of digital assets makes it the-
oretically possible for any entity to build its own digital 
asset data infrastructure. As a practical matter, however, 
financial institutions are not well-equipped for taking on 
this challenge.
Building the institutional-grade infrastructure needed to 
acquire and process all of the digital asset data needed 
for making investment decisions will require a consid-
erable and time-consuming investment in talent and 
technology before revenue-generating activities can 
commence. The complexity would effectively require 
your financial institution to enter the data infrastructure 
business, as you’d have to:
•	 Recruit a team of experienced technology profes-
sionals from a limited talent pool. This team would 
need specialized blockchain developers and data 
infrastructure management experts, among others.
•	 Implement and support data pipelines transforming 
raw data into actionable information from block-
chain nodes and exchange connections with 24/7 
reliability.
•	 Process and integrate large amounts of data collect-
ed from multiple sources into actionable information 
usable by your financial teams.
This process could take many months (if not years!) 
and cost millions of dollars. But it is not necessary for 
institutions to take on the challenge of building digital 
data infrastructure thanks to dedicated digital asset data 
vendors that provide solutions and services similar to 
those offered by companies like Bloomberg, Factset, and 
Refinitiv in traditional asset classes.
Financial institutions don’t want to be in the data Infra-
structure business if they don’t have to be. They want 
to concentrate on their core business, which is providing 
financial services to their customers. What they really 
need are the fundamentals, market structural insights 
and signals to inform and catalyze your decisions on 
cryptos and other digital assets.
Between the potential returns of entering digital assets 
quickly and the downside risk of having incorrect or 
incomplete data for this data-driven asset class, it is hard 
to make a case for an institution to take the do-it-your-
self approach.

To get to market as fast as possible, it is important to 
pick a provider that can meet all of your needs for digital 
asset market and on-chain data. Trying to stitch together 
data from multiple vendor integration points introduces 
many of the operational challenges you would face if you
were building the data infrastructure yourself.
The provider should have years of experience in the 
digital asset space and the expertise necessary to turn 
raw, disjointed crypto economic data into data sets that 
are indexed, searchable, and normalized to time series to 
make it easy to answer any question about digital assets. 
It’s also important that you are getting granular, undoc-
tored, comprehensive data that isn’t smoothed out or 
filled in, so you can make your own decisions on digital 
assets.
Here’s what you should look for in a digital asset data 
vendor when it comes to market and on-chain data.
Choose a vendor that provides comprehensive digital 
asset market data. They should provide streaming Level 
I and Level II price data to enable your real-time deci-
sion-making. You’ll want access to live & full historical 
prices for any specified crypto asset. The vendor should 
deliver real-time and historical reference data to meet 
your trading and compliance needs. For example, they 
should provide access to VWAP and TWAP on and 
across exchanges, as well as OHLCV. They should provide 
Best Bid and Best Offer data (BBO) to give you visibility 
into spreads and potential slippage. Your chosen vendor 
should provide visibility into global price discovery and 
market depth on all major spot and derivative exchanges. 
They’ll need to cover thousands of digital asset pairs and 
all the exchanges that matter to you, so your traders and 
liquidity providers can rely on the data to develop strat-
egies and meet regulatory obligations. You’ll need them 
to provide low- latency access to real-time and historical 
market microstructure data so you can effectively train 
models, discover, and manage risk, or even select the 
most appropriate venues to trade on. Make sure you can 
get access to Tick-by-tick order book events and one 
minute order book snapshots in a comprehensive API.
What to Look for In a  
Digital Asset Data Provider
By partnering with a digital asset data provider, institutions can  
begin generating investment returns without struggling to hire talent, 
learning how to deliver actionable information from raw blockchain 
data, troubleshooting and maintaining countless API connections, and 
wrestling with disparate data from numerous sources.

On-Chain Data
For on-chain data make sure the provider’s block-
chain network data sets are built for your application 
specific use cases. Your chosen vendor should provide 
low latency access to blockchain network data, trans-
actions, contracts, events, and logs for every digital 
asset, so you can analyze the smart contract mecha-
nisms that power crypto economics. You’ll need full 
transparency into every input and the resultant effects 
and market impact for every protocol in real-time as 
well as historically. Make sure your vendor provides 
mempool and pending transaction data so you can 
watch transactions in- flight before they are incorpo-
rated into a block and identify large movements to 
or from exchanges, DeFi protocols, counterparties, or 
an address of interest. They should provide on-chain 
events and data for every token combined with Level I 
and Level II market data across the exchanges you care 
about so you can develop operational intelligence. 
You’ll need the full historical activity for all accounts 
required for accounting, tax, and compliance purposes. 
Make sure they provide access to blockchain streams 
including validation data, so you can build scalable 
applications on top of on-chain data. You’ll need deep 
insight into the state and health of the networks, 
assets, and activity such as hashrate, issuance, miner 
activity, fees, supply, asset, and address activity. You’ll 
also want key indicators like NVT, asset adoption, 
uniques, risk adjusted returns, volatility, and asset
velocity to help inform your decision making. You’ll 
want access to data for filtering and ranking digital 
assets and valuation models like stock-to-flow to gain 
context.

Hopefully, this eBook has made a few things clear:
•	 You’ll need comprehensive, granular, unopinionat-
ed market and on-chain data for effective decision 
making.
•	 Unfortunately, this means building and maintaining a 
massive data infrastructure that connects to multi-
ple integration points with constantly changing APIs, 
as well as gaining the expertise to transform the raw 
data into actionable information. This is a daunting 
task that will be costly, time consuming and require 
highly skilled personnel that are in demand and hard 
to find.
•	 Rather than building and maintaining this complex 
data infrastructure yourself, partner with a digital 
asset data vendor who can meet your needs for both 
market and on-chain data. Doing so will allow you to 
concentrate on your core business and speed time 
to market for your digital asset offerings.
conclusion
Whether you’ve already started your journey into digital assets, or 
you’re just in the planning stages, you need to start thinking about 
how you’re going to get the data you need to support research, 
trading, risk, custody, analytics, reporting, and compliance to  
power your success.
