## Overall Fine‑Tune Diagnostic (2025‑04‑19)

Observed recurring deficiencies in fine‑tuned GPT‑3.5 answers:

1. Mathematical formulations frequently missing or incomplete
2. Theoretical frameworks lack depth and rigor
3. Practical implementation details often omitted
4. Empirical evidence and concrete examples insufficient
5. Comparative analyses lack thoroughness and specificity
6. Validation methodologies under‑detailed
7. Length ratio especially poor on technical topics
8. Even when longer, key conceptual details still absent

=> Action items:
   • Augment dataset with ~200 Q&A focused on math rigor, examples, empirical studies
   • Include chain‑of‑thought exemplars and explicit formula derivations
   • Strengthen system prompt: “Provide mathematical derivations, empirical citations…”
