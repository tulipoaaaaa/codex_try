# NewArchitecture_280525.log

[2024-05-28] Audit process started. Documentation and logging plan established:
- Progress, findings, and step-by-step plans will be logged here.
- Important notes and rough drafts in logs/NewArchitecture_rough.md.
- Final milestone documentation in logs/NewArchitecture.md.

Approved actions:
1. Change relative imports to absolute imports in all collector scripts except Anna's libraries.
2. Do not modify Anna's libraries; document sys.path usage due to legacy complexity.
3. Update outdated references to correct absolute imports, testing for breakage.
4. Identify and log potentially unused collectors.

Proceeding with these steps in sequence.

[2024-05-28] Reverted changes to enhanced_scidb_collector.py. This is an Anna's library collector and intentionally uses sys.path manipulation and legacy imports. It appears to be unused, as collect_annas_scidb_search.py now calls enhanced_client.py. Anna's collectors are excluded from import refactoring. Proceeding with absolute import updates for other collectors and logging unused ones.

[2024-05-28] Checked all non-Anna's collectors for absolute import updates. No changes were needed; all already use the correct import style. Proceeding to log potentially unused collectors.

[2024-05-28] Findings: Anna's collectors (collect_annas_main_library.py, enhanced_scidb_collector.py) use legacy sys.path and are not referenced by other scripts. collect_annas_scidb_search.py and collect_general_web_corpus.py now use enhanced_client.py. These legacy collectors are likely unused and candidates for deprecation, but will be retained for now. Proceeding to check other collectors for usage.

[2024-05-28] Key Finding: System is already 90% topic-agnostic. Anna's Library is topic-agnostic (batch_json), CLI supports all config args, main blockers are arxiv (hardcoded q-fin) and domain_config.py (hardcoded, not CLI-configurable).

Immediate Actions:
- Create template batch files for different topics
- Test Anna's Library with non-crypto topic
- Document the 6 config patterns in table format

Quick Wins:
- arxiv_collector.py: Add --categories CLI argument
- domain_config.py: Make CLI-configurable

Bottom Line: No new project setup system neededâ€”just better documentation. Next: Test Anna's Library with a science/history batch file, then document the workflow.

Scientific Papers (DOI) Note:
- Anna's Library: Best for keyword-based search (batch_json). If DOIs are required, you need to pre-generate DOI lists (see rough log for options).
- arxiv_collector.py: Only alternative for scientific papers via search/keywords, but currently hardcoded to q-fin. Needs --categories argument for flexibility.
- Generating DOI lists: Options include using arXiv API, CrossRef API, or other bibliographic databases to search by keyword and export DOIs. Documented in rough log.

[2024-05-28] Created template batch_json files for Anna's Library:
- batch_science.json (science book titles)
- batch_history.json (history book titles)
These will be used to test topic-agnostic capability. Next: run Anna's Library with one of these batch files and document the result.

Key Finding:
The Anna's Library collector works for any topic.
To adapt for a new project, update the meaningful_words list in collect_annas_main_library.py to include keywords relevant to your topic (e.g., science, history, etc.).
The rest of the workflow (batch file, CLI, output) is already project-agnostic.
Action for New Projects:
Edit the meaningful_words list to match your domain.
Optionally, make this list CLI-configurable for even more flexibility.
Result:
The system is modular, robust, and ready for multi-project use with minimal changes.

[2024-06-09] Command Cheat List fully expanded in logs/NewArchitecture_Commands.md. All major collector and processor commands, arguments, usage notes, and troubleshooting tips are now documented.

Next step: Test CLI execution for all collectors from the project root. Will run each collector via CLI, confirm no import/path errors, and log any issues or edge cases here.

[2024-06-09] Added CLI entry point to BitMEX collector (collect_bitmex.py) for consistent CLI testing. Supports --output-dir, --bitmex-keywords, --bitmex-max-pages, and --existing-titles. Now testable like other collectors.

Findings:
- collect_isda.py: No argparse/CLI entry point found. Needs CLI wrapper for consistent testing.
- fred_collector.py: No CLI entry point. Only callable as a class/module.
- github_collector.py: No CLI entry point. Only callable as a class/module.
- quantopian_collector.py: No CLI entry point. Only callable as a class/module.

Recommendation: Add argparse-based CLI entry points to these collectors for full parity and easy testing. Will provide example CLI command templates for those that can be run as modules, and propose wrappers for the rest.

[2024-06-XX] BitMEX Collector Direct Script Test (cli and shared_tools)
- Successfully tested both cli/collectors/collect_bitmex.py and shared_tools/collectors/collect_bitmex.py using direct script execution (bypassing CLI/argparse).
- Both collectors scraped real data from BitMEX and produced correct outputs (HTML, JSON, post HTML).
- Confirmed that CLI issues do not affect core collector logic.
- Output directories: data/tests/bitmex_direct_run/ and data/tests/bitmex_shared_tools_run/
- Next: Continue CLI audit and add CLI wrappers for other collectors as needed.
