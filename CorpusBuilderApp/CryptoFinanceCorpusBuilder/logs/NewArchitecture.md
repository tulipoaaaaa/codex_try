# Permanent Architecture Notes (Pending Milestone)

- The system is nearly topic-agnostic. Anna's Library and most collectors can be used for any topic with config changes (batch_json, CLI args, etc.).
- Only minor improvements are needed: make arxiv_collector.py accept --categories, and make domain_config.py CLI-configurable.
- Once these are tested and documented, record the final workflow and structure here for onboarding new projects.
