- Batch operations for processing and management
- Interactive logs with filtering and error dashboards
- User notifications for long-running tasks
- Interactive metadata editing
- Export/import of corpus subsets

### 6. Extensibility and Documentation

The application is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend with new collectors, processors, or analytics modules. Comprehensive documentation is provided, covering:
- Installation and setup
- Configuration
- Usage
- Extension
- Architecture

### 7. Complete Source Code

All source code is provided in a well-organized structure, including:
- Main application code (app/)
- UI components (app/ui/)
- Collector wrappers (shared_tools/ui_wrappers/collectors/)
- Processor wrappers (shared_tools/ui_wrappers/processors/)
- Base wrapper architecture (shared_tools/ui_wrappers/base_wrapper.py)
- Setup and requirements files

## Technical Architecture

### Base Wrapper System

The solution uses a sophisticated wrapper system that provides a consistent interface between the UI and the underlying collectors/processors:

```python
class BaseWrapper(QObject):
    """Base wrapper for all collectors and processors"""
    
    # Standard UI signals
    progress_updated = pyqtSignal(int)  # 0-100 percentage
    status_updated = pyqtSignal(str)    # Status message
    error_occurred = pyqtSignal(str)    # Error message
    completed = pyqtSignal(dict)        # Results dictionary
    
    def start(self, **kwargs):
        """Start the collection/processing operation"""
        
    def stop(self):
        """Stop the operation"""
        
    def get_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get current operation status"""
```

This base system is extended with specialized wrappers for each collector and processor, providing type-specific functionality while maintaining a consistent interface.

### Worker Thread Pattern

All long-running operations are performed in background threads to maintain UI responsiveness:

```python
class BaseWorkerThread(QThread):
    """Base worker thread for all collectors/processors"""
    progress = pyqtSignal(int, int, str)  # current, total, message
    error = pyqtSignal(str)
    finished = pyqtSignal(dict)
```

This ensures that even complex operations like batch processing of hundreds of files don't freeze the interface.

### ProjectConfig Integration

The application is fully integrated with the ProjectConfig system:

```python
def init_config(self):
    """Initialize project configuration"""
    config_path = find_config()
    self.config = ProjectConfig(str(config_path), environment='test')
```

All components use this centralized configuration to ensure consistency across the application.

### Signal/Slot Communication

The application uses Qt's signal/slot mechanism for loose coupling between components:

```python
# Connect collector signals to UI elements
wrapper.progress_updated.connect(progress_bar.setValue)
wrapper.status_updated.connect(status_label.setText)
wrapper.collection_completed.connect(handle_completion)
```

This architecture makes the application highly maintainable and extensible.

## User Interface

The application provides a professional, intuitive interface with 8 specialized tabs:

1. **Dashboard**: Overview of corpus statistics and recent activity
2. **Collectors**: Management interface for all data collectors
3. **Processors**: PDF and non-PDF processing with batch operations
4. **Corpus Manager**: File browser with metadata viewing and search
5. **Balancer**: Domain allocation management and rebalancing
6. **Analytics**: Interactive visualizations and corpus analysis
7. **Configuration**: Environment, API key, and domain settings
8. **Logs**: Real-time log viewing with filtering and search
